<seg id="1">"although I had attended the USA since 2012 at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceptionally large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films up to American music, American authors read and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I became mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I played the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura-student, who were the Supreme Regional Court with judges that were his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after method Man," me "s, as if the absolute truth is, forgets anything else, that is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, that I lived in Arizona, I had even greater my admiration for the United States."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so welcoming that you are always the one that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his bottlenderness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says what he thinks about how a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, latinos, Afroverans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted in favour for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won by the Republican pre-elections, was the highest number that ever achieved by the Party nominee."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigsoons person when I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not bring Trump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist, the people from all over the world, a deep believer that I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"even Trumps world viviation not with the author of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of" Cincinnati Inquirer "," overlooked. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours with this, the" Phoenix vacation "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity that I lived by Sandy Bahr who fought for her life long and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"nor does it fit to the commitment of Kristi Caves, who always helped with a lot of patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Friey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise counties helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those by they healed values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump his way to the appointed Republican presidential data, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people have voted for Trump because they have shared either his racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as a rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"people to arrange, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hetic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, from which most of which are, for Trump, because they would like to regain control over a country that she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David renick who commented that the cruel decision to rise a man who look with contempt on those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Ancd.).: as much as" "borrowed of white against all other ethnics"; wording of white in Andecks on the white and whiplash, which means as much means like Schleudertrauma), as it was the great Van Jones, has just been killed, what America has made so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world cherish the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one can always have, America is definitely welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenianleader, whose history, as he says himself, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"but with choosing Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America of this promise, and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again on the ruin.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who has fallen in Iraq, and what he said to the eve of the choice."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain homayun Kahn, a place in your America?" "Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latins have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "answering them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Did Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called them and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not as you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vocal and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan ended with the words:" "God was thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." "36 hours later it was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drug abuse and bandage violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this after an accidental meeting with a French pilot, which started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope."</seg>

<seg id="84">"instruments imitizers, viola, Celli, double-bass, guitars, flutes, trumpet, trombones and percussion, which were all made out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and Musicians' teacher of the children of Cateura, to the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first of all, it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>

<seg id="100">In West Africa the ship was known that this ship had already operated in liberal waters of illegal fishing before the other coast of Africa studied.</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were therefore transferred, and little geneigh, to welcome a legislative crushers of this kind in its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the compressors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refuted him, one of their harbours and WEIGC also to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "urine was the prime minister surrounded by countries who simply had to refuse everything, Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishery. he is part of a team that discovered the ship in stone."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch him there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to liberia, due to looting the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protect, was Fish-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had been driven by their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" in this way, we have eight countries who are like-minded people and work together. you will exchange information and stand each other at where it's about illegal fishing. "," says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers Fish-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is controlled by definition: what is imprisoned, is hid, present because it is extremely difficult to send it. this is the illegal fishing a major watch of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"accidental abuse of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, can harm the illegal fishing ecosystems which have a deliky balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while action against illegal fishing was once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail, so these actions occur nowadays in real time, with traceable on Fish-i's digital communication platforms."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can interact with one another for example, lists of existing licenses, news or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port."</seg>
<seg id="113">"Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive when they move to the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that are fishing in ban areas. also, such as suspected routes will discover - about such that invites you to curse its captivated fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"in the idealincident, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license, where they were on the go and possibly also whether they have a criminal register."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing, can refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. what means the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worth any longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leading Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports Fish-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to estimated 20 million USD to lost sales, which will lose eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of the illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, present for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"these practices include inter alia actions, such as the sailing among falsely flag, fake license papers, indication of phoned species, fish-protected species and fishing in protected areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of an uncomplete control system increase, "says Long." "earlier a ship could not fish illegally and a country could then say 'You darfst my port not going."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'comm to me'. 'and exactly this legale looploch tried Fish-i now to close.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed Front.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation Fish-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, which had fake licenses distributed in Tanzania. it discovered ships that have been trapped and found several fraudulent identities and it has been trapped and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with Interpol, the international authority for the fight against crime, Fish-i can share information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our studies lead us fairly far into the networks of organised crime", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that should help Fish-i, suspects ships precise and quiet."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"Fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, also helps to send the illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position to hide, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and Fish-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems that they cannot be accompanied by satellite.</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland therefore helps to build a system that connects different information levels with each other. it should help Fish-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model programme</seg>
<seg id="137">But can Fish-i's team African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened a platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed throughout the world by means of the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with the neighbors to get a better picture of what where is doing - this is simply sense, "" says he. "" here is an opportunity for countries to unite and combine their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts have a similar project to run, in which a global system allows persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that Fish-i's activities are not only criminal, but they are also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that earlier without license must have fished and hardly ever had consequences they know that they are observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in Fish-i took some of the countries involved in a 33% increase in fisheries set, since fishing boats is growing more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after Fish-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing networks, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of Fish-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries notice these successes." "the effect is so strongly that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study objective." "in West Africa, hundreds of millions of dollars will disappear through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, 2015 six countries have joined forces, so called West Africa Task Force. they also fight against illegal fishing, after exactly the same model such as Fish-i." "the goal is to create more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, Fish-i's younger member could report its first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship which were under false flag on the go. and not only was the ship on the way and were used tow networks, which is now forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also included in bothered waters which are reserved for fishermen in Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they continue against illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for Fish-i this is a further success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a particular, collaborative working method works for the protection of the oceans is actually working in the entire world sea.

<seg id="377">You need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the output text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language.</seg>

<seg id="544">"in the beginning of March 2017, known for the Northeast of Japan, Kahoku Shimpo, the progress made in the last six years have been affected by the" "Triple catastrophe" "of March 2011. a vast earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. the Prefecture of Miyagi was the prefecture of Miyagi, which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and neighbouring countries Fukushima and Iwate were forced to disappear all coastal cities of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"yet, the prefecture of Fukushima a nuclear accident, already alone had to leave their homes as well as 160 000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which progress has been achieved after six years to rebuild the lives of the resident.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of Japanese rebuilding and survey results of those concerned themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (champion protein, Juigai kouei autaku) in the Prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate completed."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was able to record miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses where Fukushima has 70 percent of the closing light.</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, you still tried to spend six years after the catastrophe, evacuated of housing accommodations (champion protein, casetsu juutaku) in final replacement parts."</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple-catastrophe almost 80 000 people were forced to live in housing accommodations.</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36 000 people were living from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such housing."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 per cent of the year 2011 Evacuated from Fukushima live successfully in emergency, which was more than 75 percent of the evacuated, which were relocated after the desaster in housing estate, were settled in final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected Precontours</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the unhappiness, its doors up to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later the industrial reconstruction in the three prefabrication are far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"during almost 100 percent of fisheries ports in Iwate and Miyagi now again in operation, have recorded its operation at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery."</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the atomic accident occurred in the three prefectures agricultural land-weakly in compassion.</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi managed to recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, whereby only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed Ackerland can be used again in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a result of atomic fact, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed Ackerland of Fukushima, are located in the nuclear procession."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has far recovered from tourism, but also here Fukushima far away."</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist target in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent on the same stand as before the unhappiness. Fukushima on the other hand can only have 75 per cent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to find a total image, the paper introduced numerous surveys under the native people and among the evacuated by. she asked about the state of rebuilding and also how their sensation across the tsunami risk has changed."</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey conducted by more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey brought that 83.1 percent of the resident citizens have taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 per cent of the respondents that was still not done enough in terms of disasters prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">How to get those who had evacuated from the prefecture of Fukushima</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its attention to the location of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also witness of the worst, catastrophic injuries, atomic fact that Japan ever had to experience."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were moved to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside her native prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuated areas are most of the evacuated hausen, which need to return in proper housing, because the effort for reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive building projects. here is the construction projects that are taking place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="753">"that is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político offers the digital project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "" with the drug "" live "") to live these sacrifices and stories by people who have turned into the struggle between the prosecution authorities and cartels.

<seg id="784">It says further:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10-year Cousin thinks that he wants to hear Narco (German: drug dealers) if he is great. and it's not normal that people are songs on the" "heroism" of criminal proceedings, when they go through the streets. "</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this, as if they are tempting you to have lost, and those who have fear that they might have happened such a thing."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories to bloom figures in a statistic will be dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="788">The decay of men is unbelievable for me when the death of six people and the merwindensing of 43 students are justified in a neighboring village that they were open.</seg>

<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we assume cities, bringing the diversity - safe spaces where citizens must not forget about who they are."</seg>

<seg id="1209">"Bassoon could not know that ten years after having started working with this work, the IS was all about it, this architecture that is not only embodied by the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people's indigenous origin or in general as adjective" intoxic "." "</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or as a part of a initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"over the past few years, the rise of radical nationalistic movements has given the word an extremely valuable connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is usually used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight Hassay in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensual contents on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"it may usually be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically regenerated."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts, where they have discussed the use of the word or expressed doubt of his usage."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with fundamental meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written in Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (spage), 'Kalar oat' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on spiritual nature, whether they could woven, as he could flush his backbone as he made a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(la) to Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>

<seg id="1304">"zin Win is the opinion that she will lessen counterfaler nationalists, however, said that Facebook will be analytical, before it all posts metals, which disrupeds in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on Facetook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should be done instead, the post is carefully to analyse and control it by review the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (alternate).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that this drey nationalists, the hasslanguage spread, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcised its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while action may send a strong signal to all, the hate speech likes to keep the efficiency of this strategy not long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords is often a katzing and mouse game, whereby the users social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Myat Myat describe, such as Facebook began to delete his posts, when he just wanted to inform his friends that the word 'Kalar' from the social network is banned:"</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma due to their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Such words to censored will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a Content Sharing Convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women do avoid women with the greatest care to address the name of her husband or even of older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband's social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences they should abide the norm to exercise this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned out of the Indian State of Odisha, and rejected by her family and the village of the village after they had addressed a married couple with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of its wives also do not call on behalf of the names, is also among men. however, they have much less justification if at all, they should not come up with this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, occurred nine wives, among them Health Care as well as housewives, a unique club with and became quick to the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the enemies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs which exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers, and is committed to dismantling the patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas worked for seven years with the help of her video camera on the rediscovery of practices, such as children-up to the banishment of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They told them how these clubs are created a safe place for these women and they simultaneously have made them to botanical inside of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini appeared in its discussion round, traded by women who do not name her husband in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided to decide on this subject because she wanted to open the interview about the Patriarchate with a problem which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"in addition, the name of her husband is not to speak out loud, is a burning, who kept them all paid and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman is respected her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't hold it, is regarded as being deposited as a woman without morals."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought up to this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning he wanted to go Rohini, which has never called her husband so far in his name at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband weigh even long before the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"practitioners, my husband, turned to me and said, I solle him from now on in his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the baggage it started rohini its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchate "" never before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women. "</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women who tried to bring discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant, to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot say the name of our husband, but they can call us as they want, means that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when she brought the name of her husband over the lips, says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the Breaks of a centuries-based tradition, in the married women should never speak the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she turned out during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole changed frustration against him and his family by lowering him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ekstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"yet in the adrenalin rush along with an old breeze, the women decided that they would actually try home to name her husband in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband called a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in the head: his wife could not stop his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it with dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she died, she got afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said, I was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less comprehensible and the situation arose in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred point on the forehead, which indicates the spouse."</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why have only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the ziness red spot when he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I heard it to carry him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women did not complete thereby, but my, they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we do a trip with each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">We usually pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I do not want the women make sure who could hear what could hear," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"for the first time in her life they celebrated their own birthdays with cake; they danced, and spoke about things that they never had thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been working on some things, for example how our identities have been-knotted to our husband, never as honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, regardless of how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women have lived in the group since their marriage only Saris.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted to bear a salvein-cta, a broad Hemd about a pants; they did not have been drunk."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of own closets, morals associated with the Saris and much more, dingy Rohini its own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months of their first discussion club has already changed something, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have just made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, included me, make it still, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two will continue to tell the name of her husband; only one or two women now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives, like the finch to achieve more freedom of movement or the own closets - at the end of a hard to navigating river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this prudent gives each of us the confidence that will change something.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not just limited to 30 families. it will give a chain retraction, when each woman will go home and other people told them what we talk and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come out of cross-border groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages of those who experience them", "and offer a hyperlocal context to report on global human rights and development requirements."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid since Singapore is recognized as an independent state in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Minister K. Shangrgam, Singapore should be considered as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister, that many people criticise the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are opposed to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody asked to question whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people go a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a land.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio defences the Minister of Justice," "the logic to rotate the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices, this valuable land, we hear that we eventually be no country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded as vulgar, it had the name of a flight before the responsibilities, a must."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, eat land then it is then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons used by Shangrgam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of what he appeared inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the topic, again the good old corpses from the authoritarian feeders which give up Democrats, leaving the twisted logic since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the answers were given in the last week of Shangrgam, answers to his American guests in regard to our press, our Judikative, our political system really non-answer."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tarned with non-answers rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam, in his opinion, since they did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so in which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shangrgam, who would take their efforts to clear this point unless he was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"on the blog his comment, he pointed out to the reviews that one should begin to read the entire co-ordinance of the conference so that you could get better understand the context of the statements of Shangrgam, according to which Singapore is a city and no land."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the ordinance.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" "city" "as a country," "declared why the elections in Singapore was so uneasier, even if we are looking forward to free and fair elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He went to Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party in decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said, Singapore" was not a country, "he obviously did not make sense in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam that makes a leader of a heretic generation to make such polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what the judicial Minister of Singapore has said, very verable..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde what I expect - be with them or not, but this is another thing. "</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes that he is defended correctly and aware of what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review submitted the shaking points of Shanbragams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "gutters a mistake to commit or was it a Freudscher Deachers?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will be viewed as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the state of government, the statements of Mr Shangrgam is of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Lonavail of its military service, defend it only their city but not their land?"</seg>

<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink recruitment?</seg>

<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>

<seg id="2092">"the photo was recorded by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the much of his time drillings; times he slim to his screen, mal to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"however, one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or its with nicotine befallen lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has ended to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel ended up his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs his family were forced to flew out of their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (approximately: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for now six years Hdaib is a passionate activity, which faces the conservative majority and asks their old opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and Rapid."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often dealing with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all these topics can not only be found in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that suffice from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not restricted by limits in its mind, and he can feel according to their own statement by people who suffer the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he is not open to it, he defeats the US-American foreign policy a special circumcision."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war areas, anything that he has to do with his identity as a Palestinian poulders of the second generation." "he himself was born, even if he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think of my own living conditions so, stresses hdaib."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that because I am a man, while in the water it solves into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise until sundown."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The law also emphasized that public consumption of food is illegal during Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot young day has little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"generally speaking the sutch, warm coffee and the waders of the Kent-cigarette in the nose, first and foremost of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"so it is so easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, water to drink - to do not land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the interior of the Jordan Jordan was a show of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the jordship branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - arguing that the sexual orientation of the homosexual insignor Hamed Sinno, contradict the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputies and former spokesperson in the Islamic Coalition of DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was" straight "because of the sexual orientation of the scary."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many as well as the commitment of the band in affairs like the Arabian spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world be more dangerous activism, which represents the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila the" "progressive supporters of human rights", "which continues to be decided for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely to be probably not simply a-hand rhetoric, but actually a more evident-out reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs works clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016 Hdaib traditional Gender normen to Leibe, by bringing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have vorehelichen sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an evidently balanced woman whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who lost their lives through their hands, which they actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years the number of 'volunteering' has increased - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, the Jordan's institutional infrastructure is missing to support the women, the victims of tried and domestic violence have become appropriate to assist."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law for breakable fighting from 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of inpatient violence," due to uncertain time in prison, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee of the family is needed that the woman has nothing to happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known to do not shy away from themes, which in its country is long as taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib bestreitet that his work politically is, however, that he is his music, who is full of explicit adherence to sexuality, freedom and expression, not separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Nahost, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he became inordinated politics," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" "Edward Sa'ed" "Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and in" Ghareeb "" the focus is on poverty. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are in the core politically, can be further."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib published a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other it is also."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get, in his words," what one wants "- be it faith or non-faith, heterosexuality or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noticed that hardly any one spoke in Jordan, about the rights of gay and readers, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + -individuals are still strongly censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan OnlineProgramme Roya to remember later that his comments were caught out of the context, concealed and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today Hdaib acquires Hdaib open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals is not the Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, which still has remained in memory thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks yourself: when Abu Nuts, who should once again work on behalf of the potassium, in the eighth century it could write openly about homosexuality, why can you not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hayloitic Kingdom, there is nothing new things that the government attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are brought to the silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, recently, in January 2017, the jordurian news service took several former government members and members of the teaching association, with the reason they would have expressed concerns in social media critical about the problems which coincide with the deep in the land."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert of Hdaibs opinion, it is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a continuous package and taking care. Jordan has won mashrou'Leila now for the second time in a row, it looks like sdaib - consists of slow, thought and internal changes. he is sure that these changes are held from day to day at the heart of the American society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also, from an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only from his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and on artificial kind. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until then, Hdaib will continue to continue and therefore resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel dispersed, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went exactly the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga by the Stiftung BogotArt and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth-Foundation is no longer available from the head and inspirational them to the campaign Cartas por la reciliación (letters to reconciliation), the young people to write to guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was a place of a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace agreement with the Guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Arumbiens), which forms the conclusions of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"it was the signatories of the peace contract, as significant, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos has received the Nobel Prize for his understanding of the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, before the columbians, there is a long way to see from real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived for many years in illegal bearings, were exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons have to be integrated into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred to guerrilla harveil, these must now take in their ranks and support them to build a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians would have to join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: until now you have written thousands of young people letters - love botheres in former guerrilla warrians to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla warrior - which should be personally handed over.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for letters to reconciliation was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Prize who took place in February 2017 in Bogotá. there were Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk just with Kailash of Satyarthi, the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>

<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letters, full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write their place in society and have to build a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history into a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far as part of the campaign, more than 2000 letters were collected."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizera, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never imagined that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March at one of the UN warehouse in the Caldono-Cauca Region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city council of Cali and Leonardo from the foundation of Bogoticrists in the camp to convey the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the ARC set up, as they had done before, to counter the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but letters full of subjection people from all over the land."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can walk in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that in between, the politicians of the President Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra is a co-worker of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca describing this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of the Guerilla-fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the Guerillarfighters live) I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I had afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-Granatov, a deadly weapon in the Dornbirschenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said it nevertheless and asked:" "hello, what do they do?" "he answered," "I answered on a letter that someone has written me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answered him." "I suddenly turned the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him completely and set me next to the granulators.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was sorry, he was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this struggles, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never did anything about life than war. he had never been able to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger." I have never thought that anyone would give me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, which awaits us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the prelude came to students, and some leaders of the FARC to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC already existed in the Hidden.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: for many years, we experienced the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country."</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people listen so far as never heard and had no electoral law, and to recognize that people who have seen as monsters and even hate, even people with beautiful emotions which were turned through their life conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country is alive, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - including those who have killed and so much damage, can bring us something to bring us and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after the design of peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to attack the weapons and to protest to their rights. and this is absolutely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we are now committed by the FARC to peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"for this reason, we call all defenders of peace in - regardless of what race, religion or ideology do they belong to all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, are many difficulties."</seg>

<seg id="2290">"we cannot upgrade, because you are a devout woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay down a knitting around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily they came to neighbours and delivered them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car with tapped window washers and a numbering plate with a 95 dron.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"once it was the third time, I was clear that there was something lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My traffickers friends overtest the numeric signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how are you brave?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I do not want to give their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then it happened somewhat unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her, without register without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to and checkout into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you believe not about, you believe in safety, just because you left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which place you put. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, about the sex equation we don't talk, this is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements still trage me in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so very I also wish, this comforting barrier can I not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person to look out of their past - therefore to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed in?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I was able to report a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke with someone who spent a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he closed a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now focusing on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives before they take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end require a proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced" through the blood of satisfaction. "</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even more weakened men in these secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a familiy of me says, there would not be very many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no enough relatives or who were dropped out of their relatives, to face Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that you can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be lifted up, they will show their bodies on TV and claim them, they would have attacked some village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappear, but deliberately suppressed in order to radialize."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have someone who had argued for a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was since then nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken them back.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and so-called Lord, this person was by himself when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why otherwise you have not allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called" "non-traditional" orientation, already in the past? "</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I had my hair always long.</seg>

<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, back then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to lead us to the" "civilian arization", "finally, it ultimately has thrown back into the Stoneage."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were added: I had colored eyelashes, carried redhrenjeans and short tops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Department of Safety of Sharia has never led me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and all the city knew; they knew why men, young people, there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been enforced.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a reapplication: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotto does not say about the unhappiness of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"you often say it to children, if the sick about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never been corrupted, never soased and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this Gnome time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came upon the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"as he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began speaking on TV on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he does not speak about us per se, but mainly on the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel like the people in the city started to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who previously suffered, and had suffered, saw you once upon once with Argwohn."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I leave Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I did not spend much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as activistin."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truce."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of sensation in order to be accurate, different life-settings."</seg>

<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women are responding to women - especially white women who call themselves as interseculale feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well thought, scientific and social arguments against me, why I should be feminist and why we generally need to be both feminist *."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today despite the same formation still less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women encounter sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and that discrimination based on the sex is still moving across the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of it and I do double and triple.</seg>

<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research, there are two reasons: for an lacking in the offer of global health, many medicines and vaccines which cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have more serious impact than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases are a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is conducted by African scientists themselves, in building up its own research capacity in Africa. a major role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" Seeberger producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky appeared originally on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on the solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton breeds in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 sorts, such as outredgeous, the first plant that has grown from NASA astronaut in the space and consume."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years Mortons of work has been working only by its own deposits and the question, how many salaries he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he got that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents gold are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been registered on ever more plants such as grain - or cartels. because of this trends, plant breeding and experts are committed to food safety for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as passionate about a millennia of an millennia of ancient tradition, Morton is still salad, but it needs to be more and more and more restrictions on the basis of this work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a boultry that I have to pumped."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed any more new salts, because all the characteristics are patented. so he makes it as good as possible and try to breed those characteristics which he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is being protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breed).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronaut of the International Humanstation ISS have red redmersalat the Sorte Outrigeous in the" greenhouse "of the station bred and eaten there. there will be tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name is rather like this, when the movement came from the IT area and not from the plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" Seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software. "</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched to live in order to ensure that some plant types and gene not are being protected as intellectual property, and so are permanently used for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, briefly Ossi, the US breeder can undertake to use that others can freely use of them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and to sell it." open source "" breeders allow only others to breed with their seed, and it will not immediately expelled them - two aspects that are banned or written by many plant holdings. "</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Scaffolding prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Vorspiel, Jack Kloppenburg are control over the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food safety and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over nutrition and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeder would try, the latter not or only little to use, making seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" Open-Source "movement does not work with genetically modified crops."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, cork, gentleman, or not, from ecological agriculture, or not." in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds from ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer will also know that in August or September 2016, we should know that the way it is bred about how this vegetables is bred. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">Nutrition sovereigns without seeds is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative will also commit themselves to ensure that their seed will continue to be freely available. with this, their approach in contrast to this, seed and plant characteristics are to be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporter argues that the future of food supplies is at risk, since the available outdoor pool is always available due to the always numerous werdation intellectual property rights to plant material, which therefore always adapted to shrinking."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, who is director of Ossi, has engaged in their doctoral thesis with genetics in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all boxes are being protected as intellectual property, making it not usable for plant breeder either at all or within it."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts as Luby suspect that mass-built plants such as wheat in still largely styled style are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be bred that they are targeted characteristics - of such, through which their tastes or their color improves up to such, due to which they insist in certain environments or diseases such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patent properties to plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder passes through ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary than ever before, since the changed conditions in climate change are much worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-speaker Carly Scaduto, that genetic diversity is generally important and also critical for Monsantos activities. with a total of four foreign banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property develop other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varietal innovations. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often helping these instructions to get others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection inhibits innovation not, but promotes them by providing the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait, until a patent expires, certainly not innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you are waiting to be waiting for a long time to grow, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, if you have lost the battle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and it should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what we drive, and it won't be impossible if we can not continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton has bothered itself on the concept to patent plants:" "we create the characteristics not really itself."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants make them ourselves and as breeder we finally have no idea how the plants do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant intimidine in the US-State Oregon and Ossi's committee, there is another key aspect of plant breeding:" "who is a variety of plant breeding, and also reared its own values into them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large courtyards and monocultures, for their cultivation massaging herbizide, bred in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just a hurry. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than B. Monsanto are patents, create it most smaller seed companies, even without patents survive, either reject it or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden.</seg>

<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of pesticides were innovative:" it looks like I with my efforts to produce new, stronger than corporations, the patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," he says. "with a patent one is just 20 years ahead of competition, what makes it very nice for my opinion quite simply." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the United States seem to be leaders in the" Open Source "" breeding leader, but the concept is now growing fast all over the world. "</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the centre for sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, an" open source plant breeding program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain demands. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agreement col is working on an" Open-source "license, which eventually is a formellere and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeding vary from country to country, which can not simply become one of one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016 the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declares that conventional plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the present practice of the European patent application, patents applied to conventional plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet a law; it is now on the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organisation Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "" seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operator of seeds and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn something about the "open source" seed movement and the global trend towards the patenting of seed. "</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program for" Open Source "" Seeberger Systems explains that the organisation is currently taking a global alliance for "Open Source" "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start-up."</seg>

<seg id="2693">"in September the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Knight Foundation and others - published a report as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and other - a report published. it represents that farmers will need to share seed and improve the seed policy so that a stable supply of food can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply with seeds will be emphasized for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby of Ossi hopes that will soon become more people."</seg>
