this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times .
&quot; long before anyone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book , in which he was spectacular , that the N@@ SA is illeg@@ ally heard by Americans . &quot;
&quot; but , it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression . &quot;
therein he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret operation in which the CIA is literally over@@ laid for an atomic bom@@ b .
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
&quot; but do you know , whom the chapters are not going out at all ? &quot;
the U.S. government .
&quot; almost 10 years , the government has been determined against r@@ isen , and called him to call his inn@@ ed sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the pattern of the government , whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers and bes@@ po@@ ke journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitu@@ tional , the media have the right to publish the secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right if the media doesn &apos;t get this information and if the identity of the bra@@ ve can not be protected that they give . &quot;
&quot; and when the government lo@@ wer@@ ed at R@@ isen , he did something that many bra@@ ve re@@ por@@ ters already did before him : he consecr@@ ated and said that he would rather go into prison . &quot;
&quot; so from 2007 to 2015 , he lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , has something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they are years of information that it vital for their case , the demands of the government were dropped out . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ por@@ ters can still hide less .
&quot; instead of fail and contribute to the statements , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so have the investig@@ ators , without its consent , his phone @-@ wise secret , &quot;
&quot; just as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank@@ note , its credit card , and even guide on the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers and Ris@@ ed source , to condemn . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is just one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers . but instead the judi@@ ciary was more condem@@ ned than all U.S. governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of having a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers for a journalist . &quot;
&quot; we therefore set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional , because the government has ever more possibilities to send all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows the rights of por@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take it from the moment in which they contact , rather than in the neighbour , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that has not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is much more secure than normal email or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transfer system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers , which was originally developed by us Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to an messages website , such as the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any ordinary mail . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which the particular news agency access has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain any more information , and many of the information they would request , would not be available from pre @-@ in . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world develop new sp@@ ying technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technology den@@ ominator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to make mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers . &quot;
&quot; the over cont@@ ests in the care of soldiers was modest , and by crowded hospitals , the alarm to susp@@ ected water from F@@ lin@@ t pro@@ poses . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider who war@@ ned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our of all constitutional rights . &quot;
&quot; regards , &quot;
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data l@@ ery of the history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; has been hi@@ des . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ aten Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to make a statement . &#93; this week we were by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as mos@@ unch bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say , &quot; okay , we need an anon@@ ym@@ es company . you can setup the setup ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has come back .
also there are reports that a fo@@ e of the brut@@ al Syrian dict@@ ator Bas@@ har al @-@ Assad has ero@@ oms in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of Kinder@@ t@@ ales , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , who are nervous the next release , and the next un@@ veil@@ ed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of a Ci@@ ph@@ enth@@ r@@ ill@@ ers or John @-@ Gr@@ ish@@ am @-@ commun@@ e .
&quot; it seems cr@@ ying away from you , to me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we deal with what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and do not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide , their assets and v@@ ise -- something that we discuss for ten years and reve@@ aling it . &quot;
&quot; I think , many people appear all the world very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I imagine it always like an Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it nearly impossible to really understand who behind these prayers . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal attor@@ neys , and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; pres@@ um@@ ably because there has not been no prominent American people who settled in these revelations , this scan@@ dal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who have hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle , according to which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we could have a data l@@ eck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. states less information to specify less information to form a company than to create a bibli@@ ography . &quot;
this kind of in@@ contin@@ ence in the US has allowed employees of shoulder to school@@ children to pick up school@@ children .
&quot; it has frau@@ dul@@ ent permits , especially decent investors to be zo@@ omed . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior which concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a li@@ mel@@ ted investig@@ ators in the offices of 13 sub@@ contractors in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as African Minister , who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house , a yacht , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really sho@@ cked us that everyone up to a lawyer in our investig@@ ators made suggestions , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ dic@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone was handed over money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as a certain inci@@ dent .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , which has been introduced to our ear@@ liest investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; it is not a particular leader , involved in a scan@@ dal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules of rules . &quot;
we have to change the rules to sc@@ ate this kind of behavior .
&quot; this may sound all very comfor@@ ting , as if we could do nothing about it ; as if nothing could ever have changed ; as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as new@@ born optim@@ ism , I see quite that a lot has begun to change . &quot;
in the last few years we have seen violations of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU captured in central regi@@ sters at national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA are lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have brought a legislative development in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , as a means used to provide more transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do @-@ firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians , who recognize the problem and use it through laws to end this kind of in@@ contin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; together we can finally end this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I once almost kid@@ n@@ apped almost and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ an@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; a day after I finished my design studies , I made a rear @-@ off . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da was standing and look at my stuff .
he bought one of my art@@ works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peac@@ em@@ ps .
I lu@@ d him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where , thou sh@@ ank you today ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know it . &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him just about it ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not ent@@ angl@@ ed in the trunk of a ma@@ iden ! &quot;
this is a small trunk @-@ sitting room !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a bub@@ ble . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; I , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in the bed , I sat down to the ceiling and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh husband ! what have I worked out there ? &quot;
a wilderness sleeps in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I rose out of the bed , on z@@ eh@@ en@@ ligh@@ ten to the door , and my sleeping bags closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought by me depends today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as fore@@ igners , actually friends who wa@@ ited only to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air @-@ rats , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a head , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m un@@ employed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ ommate moves out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think , creativity can make it easy to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ ommate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over@@ laid out how we could make something to make . our apartment will stay with us , wireless internet and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and based so &quot; air @-@ rats and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ nb &#93; .
three lucky guests dur@@ ated with us for 20 dollars on the air @-@ foot on wood@@ ground floor .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham mel@@ et tasted completely different , because we made them for our guests . &quot;
we walked with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle was star@@ ed Brian and thank you .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former ro@@ ommate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website on which people open publicly pictures of their private spaces , their bedrooms , their bathrooms , their bathrooms , whose doors one closes , when you visit . &quot;
over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them .
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we wa@@ ited that the ro@@ cket would be .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; no one , who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop , the stran@@ gers allowed to sleep in apartments other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned as children that stran@@ gers are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , you are looking forward to the things that one can easily . we could des@@ ig@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create through design immense trust between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like ?
is it possible to create with design confidence ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree trust we would like . &quot;
it is a 30 seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort .
th@@ um@@ b high if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I like to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
enter your correspon@@ ded mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this silent operation of pan@@ ic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what we feel when you open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing , which is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the correspon@@ ded mobile phone of a stran@@ ger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they stay differently . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only so , who has now actually Al Go@@ res cell phone ? &quot;
could you be announced on Twitter that he en@@ coded for the office of the President ?
you can return the phones now .
you now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you some discoveries .
what if we have changed a small detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had only been presented with his name ; if he would have been telling about , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 Be@@ ur@@ butions you say , &quot; &quot; he can really kno@@ ck them very well and liked hand@@ ys ! &quot;
how would you feel like you &apos;d like to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well sophisticated feedback system strength@@ ens the confidence crucial .
at the beginning we still have some things wrong .
it was difficult for those people to finish negative assess@@ ments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until the host and also the guests were submitted their owners before we made them online . &quot;
last week we have discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted with Stan@@ ford a study . we were examined , as likely it is that people face each other , depending on how they are related to ages and residence . &quot;
little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pres@@ bi@@ ased .
it will be thr@@ illing when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by reference numbers .
&quot; if you have less than three departments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but , one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of common simil@@ arities .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted ones .
&quot; besides , we learned that trust is dependent on how much one is there . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell a little bit , like for example , &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells us much , like for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle &quot; &quot; art works in your apartment ! I have been doing with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on the hope that the correct design can help , to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces to stran@@ gers . &quot;
&quot; what we did not reck@@ on , was the great amount of people who were more than willing to specify these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you can see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; firstly , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
&quot; third : a need , which previously had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business is doing very well .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything smooth running . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties celebrated or d@@ well@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust has been broken .
there is nothing short of evil than these calls . I have already hurt if I just think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the calls , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 millions of nights had only a fraction , but a problem . &quot;
for humans trust each other rightly .
when confidence works , it can be wonder@@ fully . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host was driving him into the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travellers who circum@@ cis@@ ed due to sitting activities on heart infections .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are true prot@@ ector , to save one life even though they don &apos;t know it correctly . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you dies , and wait , while you get a b@@ yp@@ ass . &quot;
&quot; because they do not want you feel lon@@ ely , they bring books past . &quot;
you can even stay longer without the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay does not run .
but these relations behind the pure money trans@@ acting are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first read about this term about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions together ?
it is here about an economical trading .
&quot; but it is simply to name &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
&quot; share Economy describes a trade , human relations promises . &quot;
people lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when one is wor@@ shipped today , this is very efficient with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; what would be , if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what would be when in any place you attended , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly complete and one with a pub our neighborhood that one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to make apartments from the ground up to co @-@ operation ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of common participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces , which belon@@ ged to the government . &quot;
&quot; now An@@ omm@@ ates were offered . students who were looking for a bakery , &quot;
were passed on to people whose children were educated . there were inc@@ ub@@ ators .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy Class . through our platform alone , night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stran@@ ger or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be so crazy as it was supplied to us .
we have not inv@@ ented the wheel .
hospitality was also previously mentioned .
there have been some similar websites before us .
so why has just this work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we think that you can find the right design with the components of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I find this intri@@ gu@@ ing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time when a red Maz@@ da is over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I ask myself , what we can use design soon . &quot;
&quot; regards , &quot;
what do you think when you watch me ?
a belie@@ ver ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ ins supp@@ ressed , a terrorist player ? &quot;
or simply a delay in safety check at the airport .
this is actually true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
thus the media people represent the look like me .
a study yiel@@ ded that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans mean , most would not know Muslims . &quot;
probably people do not speak with their web@@ bers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims , it &apos;s great to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream extra . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
one @-@ man @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ m@@ es.com
&quot; and I am a practical , spiritual Muslims . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga s@@ ings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I have decided to do it .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ched me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual person , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my headphones . &quot;
&quot; my femin@@ ist friends were ent@@ angl@@ ed , &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ tige was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty . &quot;
I have not only believed the faith of my parents .
I have been with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , placed in question , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devot@@ ion to deep@@ en himself with every reading of the basket .
the beauty of the rhyth@@ mi@@ k brings me sometimes for we@@ eping .
I feel myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone you percei@@ ves you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like .
&quot; I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as a engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot;
then came the terrible tomorrow in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had an end to the ear@@ liest , look at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes fle@@ w in buildings , people sp@@ ans from buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in feeling .
why should you do something ?
&quot; I joined the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had , &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ b Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the acts of others depart@@ ed from another citizen into an susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the integration process . &quot;
&quot; I remember , how I went up -- as we were walking -- so deeply it went into my seat , and I was afraid , when Muslims recognised . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment into our apartment , in a new city , where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic Organ@@ izations , who bes@@ ieg@@ ed : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; B@@ ays in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ elt you do not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday all the week -- the day to gather for Muslims to the prayers .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; does not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw an extensive coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understan@@ da@@ bly un@@ il@@ ly and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims , and sm@@ iled for Muslims . &quot;
there were really fire@@ places on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something really felt right .
&quot; because the people who had attacked this country , our country are attacked . &quot;
I have rejected the anger of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain herself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the acc@@ us@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can indeed say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we go off ? &quot;
some people want to connect Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tum@@ or in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tum@@ or removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ or you only stops while watching .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all the other Americans , no tum@@ or in the body of the U.S. , but an essential organ . &quot;
theme :
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ el@@ fer and Olympi@@ oni@@ ken . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques and America will make safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking , but not the terror stop . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and larger citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; when the Radi@@ c@@ alisation process is determined that he will start online . when the person gets a brain , even from her family , so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ sent their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must keep people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still asser@@ ted that Islam is a non@@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS justified its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; Muslims , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we have to do everything to do a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to her imagination , if you acknowledge them as a representative of 1,@@ 6 billion believers . &quot;
theme :
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux he@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ideology reasons behind their &quot; &quot; Holy book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving in what they las@@ hed in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scri@@ ptures .
an outstanding I@@ mam told me a amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they would have imag@@ ined to ex@@ clude the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him whether she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy with whom she had spoken , brought her to the silence and told you that their anger would bring their sense to inj@@ usti@@ ce in the world , they would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; nothing inspired and something that would have given to her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument by extre@@ mi@@ sts who gave it a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam made the connection to God and their church .
&quot; rather than to blame them for their anger , he showed her constructive way for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what they learned in the mosque , and keep it before the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ opho@@ bia me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects every day on our democracy ?
a study -- actually showing several neuro@@ scientific studies -- when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we rather accept an authorized government system , conformity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you have a review news , which has been reported negative for Muslims , they agreed rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circum@@ cis@@ ion of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood against Muslims led to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then , it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the fore@@ front of the Iraq war and during two choices of voting .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for mani@@ p@@ ulation of the public to ex@@ clude the foundations of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the tox@@ ic air of fear mis@@ ses us all . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the assignment of collective bar@@ codes , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple , which lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both of them went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , much promise ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet , l@@ est man was , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was amazing and said :
&quot; when is from my br@@ ace , such a diversi@@ fied young man became ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne , her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Cra@@ ig Stephen H@@ icks , she mur@@ dered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in their apartment , as with an arrangement , after he posted statements against Muslims on his fac@@ ebook page . &quot;
he set up eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be imm@@ oral but also fat@@ al .
&quot; so , back to the beginning . &quot;
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or stayed at home ?
&quot; we liked it and for us it was no easy decision , for it was about which America we want to leave our children : one that would be able to control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child @-@ seat we drove up , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went my shoes , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw , let me stick . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , thank@@ ed and was welcome to our guests , for the half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , belie@@ ver , credit@@ ors , and non @-@ credit@@ ors who came not to address us , but to help us . &quot;
in that moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and sympathy of pan@@ ic and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you select in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safely ?
or will you join where my : we are better than the ones .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have made a ner@@ ve .
&quot; but I ask myself what you say that you might say that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with drau@@ ght , in a no@@ ble mind @-@ factory , thus an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , decei@@ ve not . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if one looks upon Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever accomplished study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want to live prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for b@@ ills , stands just before , to become a milli@@ ar@@ den@@ shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial drug . possible that is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air packages , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the F@@ RAC Centre in France , has built a six meters high tower at the F@@ RAC Centre in France . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
by cont@@ acting reach aircraft high speed and acceler@@ ation on narrow space .
you can also build self @-@ constantly resi@@ li@@ ent structures .
they learned to wear loads to deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally respond to natural legislation .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; to operate a system aut@@ on@@ om , it must know coll@@ ectively , where in the room the mobile objects can be found . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic T@@ asks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s dem@@ os we use a new localization technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a representative of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors , to determine the position in the space to determine and determine what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level e . e.g. &quot; &quot; launch &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so@@ gen@@ ed rear @-@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a flying unit , which tries to beat two fingers with a fla@@ p . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ fle@@ a , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ ons , it can flo@@ at , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a back@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of tail@@ ors is that they react sensi@@ tively to tur@@ mo@@ il as wind bo@@ es .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimum position is recovered , and the power can be improved by exercising . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce fundamental abstract issues that penet@@ rate the heart of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the petty @-@ possible number movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
helicopter are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you .
&quot; two decades ago , trained pil@@ ots have been able to fly @-@ controlled aircraft , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
&quot; long ago , we discovered that F@@ lies with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical @-@ shaped aircraft . it was inv@@ ented before short . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hinges and cross @-@ sections , no further adju@@ stability or contro@@ l@@ ation areas , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the interior life very much , so it can be stable and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ m of the rear side . to bring it to the F@@ lies , I have to take it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability that it is exactly right if all to see , is small , so I show you a video that was fil@@ med yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in Gen@@ ü@@ lich , this machine is here , the om@@ cop@@ ter with his eight prop@@ ellers , a exercise in abundance . &quot;
what do you do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is just symmet@@ ric .
therefore it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
thereby he receives the equ@@ est@@ rian ability ;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction it is fil@@ med or even how he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is available in models , the rest is lear@@ ns directly at the F@@ lies . &quot;
see you this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns into the c@@ lock@@ wise .
and the other against the c@@ lock@@ wise .
&quot; when one build them , they act like a high @-@ performance @-@ Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying , although limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by one half of them .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic carpets .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took custom@@ ary Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disk of bread -- and provide them with localization technology and algorithms .
&quot; every unit is white , where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no ceiling . &quot;
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the especially safe machine there dr@@ y@@ me would like to be a flying light lamp@@ shade at Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of these technology . &quot;
for types of as us lies the reward in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , as wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , allowing them to form so spectacular ways . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes in a very far distant galax@@ y two black holes are getting faster and they turned out so the mass thir@@ ties in a tenth of pure energy .
this short moment they shining bright as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they put your energy in the form of light free --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time emotions and explo@@ ded the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events at first time .
1.@@ 3 billion years ago there was a great life on Earth for several years ago .
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , SA@@ U@@ RI@@ ER , people and -- God stand for us at -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group of particularly bra@@ ve -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , K@@ IP Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ector , which arise about a coll@@ ision black holes . &quot;
most kept them for crazy .
&quot; but enough people knew them as a crazy geni@@ us , leaving the US National Science Foundation financing their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , design and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ector LI@@ GO : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ eter@@ - Gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following time , the precision of LI@@ GO could be substantially increased , making the power output enorm@@ ously improved . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced LI@@ GO .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LI@@ GO was started for a final test run by some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ative black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the far@@ ewell to my to@@ ken &apos;s father .
&quot; basically , it was the fruits of my life . &quot;
all this for what I did not have worked is no longer science @-@ fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ c@@ ist at MIT . he has been investigated for 23 years of Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their by observ@@ at@@ ories such as LI@@ GO meas@@ urable signals . but what are Gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a magnific@@ ence in the emotional of space and time .
at the temporary the shaft the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other gest@@ ure .
&quot; to the illustration , lec@@ turers in courses for the Rel@@ ative theory often have a real ber@@ cul@@ tured dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves is extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched with the waves of waves and stri@@ pped . the cl@@ ue of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this is called 20 N@@ ul@@ les according to the Com@@ ma , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one explained the LI@@ GO employee for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometres long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length should be measured less than a thousand st@@ el of radius of a nucle@@ us . that is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; described K@@ IP Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LI@@ GO@@ s , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ c@@ ist are er@@ fin@@ ally and with the support of the public , all the obstacles are overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
&quot; back to LI@@ GO . Scott maintains , LI@@ GO be more than an eye . &quot;
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visual light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than things around us : fac@@ tions , the size of your hand . &quot;
this is quite handy . for this way you can create an image or a map of things by watching it from several points of upcoming light around you .
in tones is different .
audi@@ ble notes have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things to make it particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child .
&quot; instead we lau@@ gh according to certain properties like pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob down@@ ward it . &quot;
&quot; Sor@@ row Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot manufacture with them a simple pictures of objects in the All .
&quot; but by clicking on changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least are the frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; if we thus convert wave @-@ pattern in Sch@@ all , we can literally speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , making my colleague Scott already very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , tro@@ pics simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turning the two body very quickly , one can hear the same p@@ ater@@ pillars with an extra sound change . that sounds like to : W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u @-@ W@@ u ! &quot;
it is a kind of movement that is defined in the wav@@ el@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I have never forgotten -- heard LI@@ GO : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des Unit &#93; J@@ em@@ and , who knows how to hear it , recognis@@ es this as the noise of -- SH : ... two black holes , each round as the sticks of your mixer . &quot;
AA : consider ourselves briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dich@@ ot@@ om@@ ni@@ est body in the universe , one with a mass of 29 son@@ nen , the other with a mass of 36 pen@@ cils , circles around one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine that forces before .
fantastic .
and we know that because we heard it .
therein lies the constant significance of LI@@ GO .
&quot; LI@@ GO eb@@ net a completely new way to study the al@@ ls , as it was never before possible . &quot;
on this way we can listen to the all and the invisible .
much in space we can -- practical or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ t stars in Super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we learned a lot about all of them .
&quot; the exciting physical events occur however in the core , which is behind thousands of iron , carbon and si@@ licon . &quot;
we will never go through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be more transparent glass . the Ur@@ cr@@ o : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see , as the Ur@@ cr@@ all is covered by his own after@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , it should be possible to drop down to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before , and by whom we do not have any idea . things we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LI@@ GO found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the LI@@ GO project , says to this topic : ME : the type of stars , the black holes , such as LI@@ GO they observed , are the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous , old body from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are so@@ aring for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LI@@ GO enables us to make a completely different point of view to the events in space , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now exists to be as cour@@ ageous as only possible .
thanks to LI@@ GO we know how to build great det@@ ectors and decor@@ ate the rust@@ ling and p@@ ater@@ pillars of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ at@@ ories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ at@@ ories on Earth and All .
for what could be ni@@ cer than to lau@@ gh the urine ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
&quot; regards , &quot;
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; whether it nervous me nervous , brought me in unpleasant situations , I managed to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
would I wanted to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to begin with the shows ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , w@@ ov@@ or I fe@@ ared , leaving my fear . &quot;
&quot; to keep my fear , speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a particular yes that my life deeply changed , on an unknown species . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens , &quot;
it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; guys , I need milk for my beak @-@ ass . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump . and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
that Yes was the beginning
&quot; a new way of life in my family . from there I swe@@ ep me to play with them , once you call me . no matter what I am doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I painted very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : first of short I was actually complete that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ ages for playing with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author . I think things , aw@@ ake you to life . &quot;
Trau@@ m@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
Trau@@ m@@ job .
I revol@@ ve television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible to carry out 70 hours program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; every program offers hundreds of jobs , which before it existed . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , i.e. , every nine days 20 million dollar TV , four TV programs , four episodes : scanning , 15 episodes : Scan@@ dal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television was going to each other on Thursday night .
all over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spect@@ ators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created themselves , and not just fine . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who this still makes ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
Trau@@ m@@ job .
I would not like to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it because I know what you think , if the word &quot; author falls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I say it to you all of you who work so hard , whether you have a firm , a land or a class@@ room , so that I am talking about my work , so that you understand that I am not just about the computer and fant@@ asi@@ ve , and it is right if I say , I don &apos;t understand that it is not going for a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- not te@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I have deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from the not@@ h@@ ingness .
it is when I put troops on as mal@@ te I on a canvas .
so called a high sound , lie@@ fe a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and un@@ disturbed , clin@@ ically and mater@@ nal , cru@@ el and reasonable , and the best of it , is the Sum@@ mon . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working out well .
&quot; a sums starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums of sound sounds like a busy road , I could always go to her . &quot;
&quot; many people take them when I perceive them the sw@@ amp@@ ly that I over@@ write writing , that writing will give me joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began with the television production , when I began to work and to work and work to create , create and working together , I discovered this thing , this Sum@@ mon , this energy . &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the sums is a drug .
the sums is music . the sums is light and air .
the Sum@@ mon is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a Sum@@ mon , you cannot do otherwise than on size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not different to be able to strive as to size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the Sum@@ mon .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ aho@@ lic .
perhaps it is called geni@@ us .
perhaps it is called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know it .
&quot; I just know that I am not afraid that I am not afraid , and I just know that I love the Sum@@ mon . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know that I do not want it to ask . &quot;
&quot; to clear one clear : the more successful I will , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more work there are , the more things the more time , the more do I have story , the more expectations there are story . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the land , which I lear@@ nt the marathon that I walk , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the sums . &quot;
I like this sw@@ amp . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sw@@ amp .
am I only this sw@@ amp ?
and then it stops the sums .
&quot; revised , over@@ laid , covered , hidden . &quot;
the mar@@ th@@ men stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that her mo@@ m is a single working place . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mother will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot;
they are the children of a Titan@@ ium .
you are baby @-@ Titan@@ ium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the mar@@ th@@ men list@@ ened . &quot;
the sums of the engine was hidden .
I did not loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sw@@ amp came not back .
my mar@@ th@@ men was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Titan@@ ium @-@ work , 15 hours @-@ days , gradu@@ ated weekends , no re@@ lu@@ cent , a titanium sleeps , there is not on , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ p .
in me it was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show @-@ Titan
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sw@@ amp and the sw@@ amp was me .
&quot; so what makes you so , when what you do , the work you love , suddenly for@@ f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , blow@@ ing the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you are doing what to do , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , and knows how the sums of sums you know , when the sums of sums you know , if the sums stops , who is then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart is listening , I can survive in the silence ? &quot;
and then I put my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; into a question .
&quot; I am on the way outside , late dr@@ an and she says , &quot; Mama , magic you playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I already want to say No , as I can be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it calls no one more &quot; &quot; k@@ ittens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I p@@ opp@@ ed it , when I am Titan and my sums bet@@ s , and here all changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , E@@ st you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters also encounter a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my pan@@ ic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sw@@ ings , I can do nothing but to fit . &quot;
I am foc@@ uss@@ ed .
I am quietly .
&quot; the land , which I lear@@ nt the marathon that I walk , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists is sti@@ cky finger and mo@@ ist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vig@@ il@@ sti@@ ff and the song , where it is going to leave , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens up and an energy bank comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sums comes slowly back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it is quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sums . &quot;
&quot; and now I feel , when I would know a magical secret . &quot;
but let us remain with the matter .
it is love . this is all .
no magic . no secret . only Love .
it &apos;s something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working environment , the Titan@@ ium , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask who you are , if I tell you , who I am when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours and how is capable of my brain , then I for@@ got what the real sums . &quot;
the sums is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the pleasure .
true sums is dependent on love .
the Sum@@ mon is the river that comes from the li@@ fest@@ l@@ ust .
true sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true sums ignored the pressure of the story , which too erle@@ di@@ eting tasks , the expect@@ ation and the pressure . &quot;
true sums is simple and original .
&quot; true sums of God is the voice of my ear , but perhaps God insp@@ ires me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am an Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I make this a rule that I can rid myself as a work@@ aho@@ lic of any debt .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play me not ans@@ at@@ Two , how to work . &quot;
the truth does hurt .
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work in the workplace as a da@@ ddy .
&quot; this understanding is pain@@ ful , because what kind of man works rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; now yes , I . &quot;
&quot; time honest@@ ly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I must have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we r@@ asen in the garden around , before and back , towards and forth . &quot;
we make small dance Parties .
we sing and play ball .
we sh@@ red@@ ded soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff@@ ness , ab@@ sent and confused . &quot;
I always go to my mobile phone .
&quot; however , it is o.@@ k . &quot;
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe filled me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever hear about playing games ?
you can also call it ! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a servant .
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they are fe@@ ared , that they want to make something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes I replaced a mar@@ ien@@ ni@@ fer or K@@ eks .
&quot; and my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more requires it not . &quot;
&quot; everyone can bring 15 minutes on the play , even at a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ dogs , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the Sum@@ mon to have a place for his soul @-@ peace . &quot;
it is not going to play with their own children . it is about joy ;
to play the &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I sh@@ aken and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books read , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to make myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes in the play , why not full 15 minutes treat yourself ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sw@@ amp came back in my free time . the sums seems to return when I am not working .
works not without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I listen to new ideas . I listen to new ideas . I n@@ ut@@ t it in full bre@@ aches and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the sums of sums it is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my sums .
the Sum@@ mon of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and for this I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is me schn@@ ä@@ ppe that I have a titanium . I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and to play more play .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my bearing is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I lear@@ nt the marathon that I walk , the troops , the sums , the sums , the sums , the proper sums : the sums of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sw@@ amp@@ ly , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new living things in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sw@@ amp , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things , I aw@@ ake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and to play more play .
Titan@@ ium have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgery .
as most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trag@@ e@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a serious stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodi@@ ly organs , a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surge@@ on ?
a doctor who tries to improve the ner@@ ve functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; sure they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; low @-@ sea stimulation &quot; . &quot; in the case , one impl@@ anted an electric drive in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that neuro@@ logical function improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson that suffered from he@@ f@@ arious tre@@ m@@ bling and severe pain .
Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surge@@ ons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was conduc@@ tive super@@ visor and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I reconc@@ iled patients with sk@@ ull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that at Schä@@ del @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ Trau@@ mat@@ a the brain rises and the sk@@ ull pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the sk@@ ull pressure . &quot;
&quot; for this , you sometimes need to remove a part of the s@@ wollen brain mass . &quot;
&quot; instead of taking the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells of a tissue piece grow , is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that is what we had to do with these cells .
after many publishers it took Jean @-@ François .
he saw he under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a regular cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you still know from the Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ Private Tu@@ ition , that stem cells are un@@ ri@@ pe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprisingly to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP .
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are imm@@ or@@ tal . &quot;
but these cells stopped differently .
they slowly split up and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell@@ aring , which looked like stem cells , but differently kept differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came .
they date from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our grand@@ brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why stay they get to us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , since we find them in higher concentr@@ ations close to brain violations . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source , the brain healing . &quot;
this we had to prove it .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then put the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then select it to mark them in the brain .
in the final step we re@@ impl@@ anted them at the dem@@ oli@@ tion of the same individual .
we call the self @-@ sufficient transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
&quot; one of our first questions was : what happens when we re@@ impl@@ ant these cells in normal brain tissue , and what will happen when we re@@ impl@@ ant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ? &quot;
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkey .
&quot; in the first scenario re@@ impl@@ anted , we watched the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched it after a few weeks ago , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not go there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we put an injury to and re@@ impl@@ anted exactly the same cells , and now the cells will get to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could see under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; these are the cells , which were re@@ impl@@ anted . &quot;
&quot; the proof that they show , are these small points . these are the cells that we in vit@@ ro , in the culture color@@ ed . &quot;
here we could not stop .
help these cells also to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual creation task .
they had to take sp@@ inning p@@ ellets of one tray .
they made them very well .
&quot; as they achieved a stable level of action , we have reached the craft cor@@ tex in the motor motor Cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were par@@ aly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , she recovered spont@@ aneously , as far as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are par@@ aly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of sculpt@@ ural brain mechanisms . they are at some degree , just as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure that the monkey had achieved a degree of spontaneous rest , impl@@ anted us his own cells . &quot;
on the left they see the monkey who recovered spont@@ aneously .
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we re@@ impl@@ anted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the impl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and later use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neuro@@ path@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson . &quot;
but our dream is still to impl@@ anted them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne , which is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I will definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one has to fill about two kil@@ ograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
BG : have a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future how many years will take it until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select patients to conduct treatments and rate , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ cent@@ ric study . &quot;
you must first show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every time .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ yne - thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as un@@ changing opponents .
we believe that capitalism leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great re@@ ah@@ mer in Beijing have definitely proven that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely und@@ em@@ ocratic .
&quot; in fact , the democracy disappear with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes which were realised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party , or some of my rede@@ emed friends , who would repeat me that democracy would be abol@@ ished when they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; please , together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a mis@@ tic , we could save democracy but that we need a true and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies become one , our future , and our great , new technologies are wast@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; for the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened by our companies . &quot;
I n@@ enne it the &quot; tw@@ ins @-@ summit @-@ parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt of Schul@@ den@@ berg , who thro@@ ws its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all see the debt , &quot;
yet few are recogni@@ zing its tw@@ illing .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , is anxi@@ ous to invest , however , where it would be productive and income where it could be productive and income , with which one could need to produce the debt relief and also all the things needed mankind , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months in the U.S. , in England and in the euro zone , 3,4 Bil@@ li@@ onen died , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , roads , quiet , equipment , and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen U.S. dollar sounds too much money until one compar@@ es around 5.4 Bil@@ li@@ onen in the same time , and absolutely nothing in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; in this way debts and un@@ productive capital make the tw@@ ist summit , which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is a stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds in the US , Japan and Europe labour , which , in which they do not invest , in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who would not invest in which they would kill him if he will kill him if he will grow . &quot;
&quot; un@@ wa@@ vered , the circumstances lead to it that o@@ edi@@ pus k@@ ills him k@@ ills . &quot;
this is my ha@@ ze with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely act@@ al art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve human talents , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies , which are decisive for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe it . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy is defined as the form of society in which the open and poor as a majority control government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy is of course too many --
&quot; women , fore@@ igners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , there would be a mistake to decrease the significance of the ath@@ etic democracy due to these connections . &quot;
&quot; the decision @-@ based on the ath@@ etic democracy was and is that they gave the working poor , but more important and crucial that they have the right to freedom of expression with the same tuning in questions of citizenship . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not been kept for a long time --
&quot; as a candle , which is very bright , it is also quickly hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democr@@ acies have not their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 1688 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the ath@@ etic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for ruling class . &quot;
&quot; because the liberal democracy came only on , as a full separation between politics and business is possible and the democratic process was bor@@ dered on politics , while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democr@@ acies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an un@@ preced@@ ented fight between the two , and the economy gradually emig@@ rated to politics . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians no longer like it ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is because you cannot be in the government nowadays , and nevertheless not in power , because the power of politics into the economy is un@@ v@@ ander@@ ed and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ ze with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about such a herd of car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res that nour@@ ished so sustain@@ ably the animals , from which they are nour@@ ished , dec@@ ayed that they are at the end so star@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that re@@ alizes the policy so far . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , the inequality increases , the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corporations are too fright@@ ened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy s@@ ells , the higher the tw@@ ist summit , and the greater the dis@@ use of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is evident that we have to bring the politics and the economy back , and it would be better when the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; has kept control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and fore@@ igners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not come .
&quot; the doctrine of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only reg@@ ain a miracle , as in the antique Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by being replaced by ri@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ Creation by means of automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics separate areas , the automation will become more deeply , the wast@@ age of the hab@@ itation , and the social conflicts deeper than I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ forming the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and we consider that we can restore the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a disease hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that can appear to the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; the question is not , whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he brought forth to survive -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a di@@ yst@@ ine , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the human being and people in the study of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optim@@ istic .
&quot; so what does it happen , how could it look like this &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; &quot; like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; like similar D@@ yst@@ opy ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples soon . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : ask a capital market in which one deserves money while you work and in which your capital will work you from a working place to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who have currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and from dis@@ solve and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction more between those who belong to companies , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , but not any cl@@ ue more between capital and labour , no big g@@ aps between investment and di@@ aries , and ultimately no und@@ rag@@ ing tw@@ ist summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please shortly before that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which will be issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; continue to tr@@ aded that the entire world trade in that currency -- call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade defic@@ it or the trade over@@ cast of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world , in which investment is r@@ ar . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically that what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Ke@@ yn@@ es proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you , is at the same time liber@@ ated , in which it is preferred people , and Marxist , because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and ke@@ yn@@ esian , globally ke@@ yn@@ esian . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
&quot; or will we reconc@@ ile into a &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ opy ? &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide to work together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
&quot; regards , &quot;
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do not , technological development will produce such a massive decrease of overall economic demand , what el@@ ry Sum@@ mers are referred to as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we &apos;re currently experiencing it , there will not only be our democr@@ acies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; similarly as Hay@@ ek , so I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Ke@@ yn@@ es , and therefore I am also complete . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if one is not ac@@ quires , one thinks not enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of speakers , you have said very clearly what you will keep from the view of the West on China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democr@@ acies we have the author of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where the most of the economy -- a totally democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , when I may say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resem@@ bles China today in the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- please remember -- we tend to link liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical as regards democratic development .
&quot; what one can now watch in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now throw to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , sm@@ ells violent to hy@@ po@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experiences as finance minister of Greece beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suppose that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appoint@@ ing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , from compl@@ ac@@ ency to say good@@ bye , and the continuous den@@ ial , that a massive supply line through the euro zone ran , and continues to massi@@ vely threat@@ ening the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity to illustr@@ ate the Greek proposal -- the way , the first suggestion was to den@@ ial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it is right . unfortunately , the powers within the euro area , within the europe@@ an group , continue to den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know yes what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get a business system that is not viable , due to political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ an@@ ism on life , it might be hes@@ it@@ ant to delay , but if then the change occurs , it happens abru@@ pt and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone is not a future if we do not change its structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everybody who looks back -- seriously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister who claims after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I have made mistakes . &quot;
the greatest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sites of the credit@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not there .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government to the case , only because they did not want to deal with the per@@ si@@ ties caused by the eurozone . &quot;
they did not want to stand that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nomin@@ ee B@@ IP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of the credit@@ ors that has risen to us this policy : &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ s@@ aler error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survived .
&quot; for when she has not survived , the acqu@@ itted Fli@@ ers shall be demon@@ ic , and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not have consequences for Europe dis@@ astro@@ us consequences but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we agree to introduce the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , w@@ on@@ ach it appears , it will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in that point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you that you were at TE@@ D . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of this have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for a lot of you .
this goes back to decision that met Roy three years ago .
Roy Price is conduc@@ tive employee at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a refres@@ hing and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for the shows and content creation , the Amazon will produce . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ cont@@ ested industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot find any one .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows how &quot; breaking Bad &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addi@@ ctive , where , after one has a season , your brain asks , &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should say enough what goes on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to teach &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts on the mean expression , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply ama@@ ze it . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is also the first time that Amazon as something makes , therefore Roy Price does not risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs a guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch everyone free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon have nothing to be out there , but if you want to get right ? &quot;
millions of spect@@ ators look forward to this episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed in the sight of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team all take up .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when one fails , which parts you will be jumping or once again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show it should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four re@@ publi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not as good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this turn is 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House lan@@ ders at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average , but not exactly what is advertis@@ ed in Roy and his team . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time at a different company , another manager is involved through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show , and he also uses data for it , but he makes it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hold a competition , he and his team have the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x spect@@ ators , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find these little details about the spect@@ ators : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a wagon and decided to do not a Sit@@ com at four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this turn . so exactly where they wanted . &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow ten@@ ders that this should work in all .
&quot; if you coll@@ ects millions of data for a decision that one meets , then one should meet a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a Back @-@ Up .
it is optimized with very powerful computer .
&quot; the min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time where we take more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this space ever in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in j@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in prison and to dism@@ iss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , will be a person good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , which may be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results created . this is not that a company like multi @-@ Health system does not know how to use data .
even the data diversi@@ fied companies are false .
&quot; yes , even Google does sometimes make mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that they can say through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the sch@@ lim@@ men &apos;s way , with data analysis of Google Search . &quot;
it worked wonderful and was a big mess@@ ing . the success of success in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year round year , until suddenly there was no longer working , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply does not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data quickly assem@@ ble companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something .
&quot; despite all these faul@@ ts data is influ@@ ential in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the rule of law , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather ensure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted gene@@ tics -- an area where some very smart people un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy ! &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you have to solve a complex problem , do you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first put this problem into its parts , so that you can analyze the parts ; as a whole , you put the parts again to write a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take away and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to en@@ force the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we own it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces again , even if the information is in@@ complete to write a good empt@@ ying -- especially if it &apos;s the brain &apos;s brain . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have data and sen@@ sibility , where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to better understand their audience , what else would not have been able to exist , but the decision how to put all these parts again , and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; this was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used to control all their decisions , first as they compet@@ ed on TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired outcome .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and in order not to be forgotten , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no , you just need to sh@@ ake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- just here in this moment . &quot;
I will make it a bit later with a technology .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much balance , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this is not changing the basic structure .
&quot; that way , the ball is clever and clever and clever . ultimately , it is possible to make choices when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays , making decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks , with which you land at the right end of the turn . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
