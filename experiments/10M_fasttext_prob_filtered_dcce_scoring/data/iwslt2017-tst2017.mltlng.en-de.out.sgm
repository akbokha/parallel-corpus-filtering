<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book, in which he was spectacular, that the NSA is illegally heard by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but, it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">Therein he describes a catastrophic US secret operation in which the CIA is literally overlaid for an atomic bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">"but do you know, whom the chapters are not going out at all?"</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"almost 10 years, the government has been determined against risen, and called him to call his inned sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the pattern of the government, whistleblowers and bespoke journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional, the media have the right to publish the secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right if the media doesn't get this information and if the identity of the brave can not be protected that they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"and when the government lowered at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters already did before him: he consecrated and said that he would rather go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"so from 2007 to 2015, he lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, has something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they are years of information that it vital for their case, the demands of the government were dropped out."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters can still hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of fail and contribute to the statements, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so have the investigators, without its consent, his phone-wise secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just as his e-mail data, financial and banknote, its credit card, and even guide on the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblowers and Rised source, to condemn."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is just one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. but instead the judiciary was more condemned than all U.S. governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of having a whistleblowers for a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"we therefore set the press work on the game that should be protected by the first constitutional, because the government has ever more possibilities to send all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows the rights of porters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take it from the moment in which they contact, rather than in the neighbour, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that has not yet been written as Risen, and it is much more secure than normal email or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transfer system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by us Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to an messages website, such as the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any ordinary mail."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which the particular news agency access has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain any more information, and many of the information they would request, would not be available from pre-in."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world develop new spying technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technology denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to make misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblowers."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the over contests in the care of soldiers was modest, and by crowded hospitals, the alarm to suspected water from Flint proposes. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our of all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">"regards,"</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data lery of the history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" has been hides.] [what does this mean?] [we baten Robert Palmer of Global Witness to make a statement.] this week we were by news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm in Panama.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of the tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as mosunch bag Fonseca go and say," okay, we need an anonymes company. you can setup the setup? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has come back.</seg>
<seg id="48">Also there are reports that a foe of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has erooms in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it claims that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of Kindertales, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, who are nervous the next release, and the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of a Ciphenthrillers or John-Grisham-commune.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, to me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we deal with what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and do not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by some few to hide, their assets and vise -- something that we discuss for ten years and revealing it."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think, many people appear all the world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like an Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it nearly impossible to really understand who behind these prayers."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal attorneys, and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there has not been no prominent American people who settled in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who have hide their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, according to which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we could have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples to have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that one needs less information in some U.S. states less information to specify less information to form a company than to create a bibliography."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of incontinence in the US has allowed employees of shoulder to schoolchildren to pick up schoolchildren.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has fraudulent permits, especially decent investors to be zoomed."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior which concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a limelted investigators in the offices of 13 subcontractors in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as African Minister, who wanted to bring money into the United States to buy a house, a yacht, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked us that everyone up to a lawyer in our investigators made suggestions, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predications. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone was handed over money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as a certain incident.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, which has been introduced to our earliest investigators."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not a particular leader, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules of rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to scate this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound all very comforting, as if we could do nothing about it; as if nothing could ever have changed; as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as newborn optimism, I see quite that a lot has begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">In the last few years we have seen violations of greater transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU captured in central registers at national level, who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA are lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have brought a legislative development in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, as a means used to provide more transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo-firms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians, who recognize the problem and use it through laws to end this kind of incontinence."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I once almost kidnapped almost and in the trunk of a red Mazanite."</seg>
<seg id="97">"a day after I finished my design studies, I made a rear-off."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda was standing and look at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artworks.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peacemps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I lud him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where, thou shank you today?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse," "I don't know it."</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought: "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him just about it! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not entangled in the trunk of a maiden!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk-sitting room!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a bubble. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "I, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in the bed, I sat down to the ceiling and thought:" "Oh husband! what have I worked out there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wilderness sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I rose out of the bed, on zehenlighten to the door, and my sleeping bags closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought by me depends today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold in childhood as foreigners, actually friends who waited only to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air-rats, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a head, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think, creativity can make it easy to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have overlaid out how we could make something to make. our apartment will stay with us, wireless internet and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and based so "air-rats and breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests durated with us for 20 dollars on the air-foot on woodground floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure that our cheese-ham melet tasted completely different, because we made them for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">We walked with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle was stared Brian and thank you.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if one could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website on which people open publicly pictures of their private spaces, their bedrooms, their bathrooms, their bathrooms, whose doors one closes, when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet they can then invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would be.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in consolation, would invest in a shop, the strangers allowed to sleep in apartments other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, you are looking forward to the things that one can easily. we could desigate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create through design immense trust between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree trust we would like."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30 seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your corresponded mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent operation of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what we feel when you open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing, which is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the corresponded mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they stay differently."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only so, who has now actually Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you be announced on Twitter that he encoded for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now have experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a small detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour had only been presented with his name; if he would have been telling about, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 Beurbutions you say," "he can really knock them very well and liked handys!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel like you'd like to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well sophisticated feedback system strengthens the confidence crucial.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we still have some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for those people to finish negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until the host and also the guests were submitted their owners before we made them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we have discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted with Stanford a study. we were examined, as likely it is that people face each other, depending on how they are related to ages and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most who are most similar.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social presbiased.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be thrilling when you add the reputation of a person -- in our case by reference numbers.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three departments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but, one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of common similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted ones.</seg>
<seg id="186">"besides, we learned that trust is dependent on how much one is there."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell a little bit, like for example," "Hi!" "you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells us much, like for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Tolle" "art works in your apartment! I have been doing with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to manufacture this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on the hope that the correct design can help, to overcome our prejudices to strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we did not reckon, was the great amount of people who were more than willing to specify these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"firstly, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third: a need, which previously had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is doing very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything smooth running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties celebrated or dwellated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing short of evil than these calls. I have already hurt if I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the calls, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 millions of nights had only a fraction, but a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For humans trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When confidence works, it can be wonderfully. "</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host was driving him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travellers who circumcised due to sitting activities on heart infections.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are true protector, to save one life even though they don't know it correctly."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you dies, and wait, while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they do not want you feel lonely, they bring books past."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay does not run.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transacting are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first read about this term about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about an economical trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is simply to name" "rent industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">"share Economy describes a trade, human relations promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when one is worshipped today, this is very efficient with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, if travelling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be when in any place you attended, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly complete and one with a pub our neighborhood that one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to make apartments from the ground up to co-operation?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of common participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now Anommates were offered. students who were looking for a bakery,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were passed on to people whose children were educated. there were incubators.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy Class. through our platform alone, night 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be so crazy as it was supplied to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was also previously mentioned.</seg>
<seg id="246">There have been some similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just this work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we think that you can find the right design with the components of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this intriguing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time when a red Mazda is over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had this great influence, I ask myself, what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">"regards,"</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a brains suppressed, a terrorist player?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">Thus the media people represent the look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study yielded that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean, most would not know Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their webbers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims, it's great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">One-man-fitness-fanatimes.com</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practical, spiritual Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do it.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ouched me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to bear the Hijab, my headphones."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were entangled," "why do you suppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lustige was: at that time it was a feminist of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, to adapt to a perfect and unreachable beauty."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only believed the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have been with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, placed in question, doubted and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion to deepen himself with every reading of the basket.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythmik brings me sometimes for weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I feel myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feel that someone you perceives you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like.</seg>
<seg id="288">"I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as a engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the Egyptian-American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible tomorrow in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had an end to the earliest, look at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people spans from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in feeling.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I joined the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "..." in the name of Islam... "..."... "jihad,"... "..." bomb Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only attacked by my country, but in the Nu, the acts of others departed from another citizen into an suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to go through the Middle West of the USA to move into a new city and start with the integration process."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, how I went up -- as we were walking -- so deeply it went into my seat, and I was afraid, when Muslims recognised."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment into our apartment, in a new city, where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic Organizations, who besieged:" be watchful, "" Seid careful, "" Bays in well illuminated areas, "" Versammmelt you do not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday all the week -- the day to gather for Muslims to the prayers.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "does not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw an extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unilly and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who held for Muslims, and smiled for Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fireplaces on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something really felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who had attacked this country, our country are attacked."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have rejected the anger of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain herself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can indeed say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go off? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to connect Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor removed as a whole and a benign tumor you only stops while watching.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the U.S., but an essential organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Theme:</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, Ersthelfer and Olympioniken. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques and America will make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking, but not the terror stop."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and larger citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the Radicalisation process is determined that he will start online. when the person gets a brain, even from her family, so that the person believes that the person believes the true Muslims, and everyone who absent their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still asserted that Islam is a nonviolent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS justified its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"Muslims, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we have to do everything to do a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to her imagination, if you acknowledge them as a representative of 1,6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Theme:</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux hean with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"both groups claim their ideology reasons behind their" "Holy book". ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it is not driving in what they lashed in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me a amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because they would have imagined to exclude the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy with whom she had spoken, brought her to the silence and told you that their anger would bring their sense to injustice in the world, they would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"nothing inspired and something that would have given to her anger, she was a main objective for the instrument by extremists who gave it a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than to blame them for their anger, he showed her constructive way for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what they learned in the mosque, and keep it before the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects every day on our democracy?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually showing several neuroscientific studies -- when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authorized government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you have a review news, which has been reported negative for Muslims, they agreed rather military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood against Muslims led to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then, it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the forefront of the Iraq war and during two choices of voting.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public to exclude the foundations of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear misses us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in addition to the assignment of collective barcodes, it is not just about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple, which lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both of them went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, much promise..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweet, lest man was, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was amazing and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is from my brace, such a diversified young man became?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne, her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in their apartment, as with an arrangement, after he posted statements against Muslims on his facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He set up eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">"so, back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we liked it and for us it was no easy decision, for it was about which America we want to leave our children: one that would be able to control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child-seat we drove up, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, went my shoes, went into the prayer hall, and what I saw, let me stick."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and was welcome to our guests, for the half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believer, creditors, and non-creditors who came not to address us, but to help us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and sympathy of panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you select in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safely?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join where my: we are better than the ones.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia you seem to have made a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I ask myself what you say that you might say that you are a TEDTalk, a mindset with draught, in a noble mind-factory, thus an exception and not the rule."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air packages, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the FRAC Centre in France, has built a six meters high tower at the FRAC Centre in France. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">By contacting reach aircraft high speed and acceleration on narrow space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-constantly resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They learned to wear loads to deal with turmoil and generally respond to natural legislation.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"to operate a system autonom, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects can be found."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic Tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology of Verity Studios, a representative of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors, to determine the position in the space to determine and determine what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level e. e.g." "launch" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a sogened rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flying unit, which tries to beat two fingers with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrflea, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the Starrons, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a backside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailors is that they react sensitively to turmoil as wind boes.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position the optimum position is recovered, and the power can be improved by exercising."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce fundamental abstract issues that penetrate the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the petty-possible number movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopter are known approximately as machines with a thousand movable parts that join forces to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"two decades ago, trained pilots have been able to fly-controlled aircraft, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long ago, we discovered that Flies with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monospinner, the mechanical-shaped aircraft. it was invented before short."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-sections, no further adjustability or controlation areas, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the interior life very much, so it can be stable and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear side. to bring it to the Flies, I have to take it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability that it is exactly right if all to see, is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monospinner is a exercise in Genülich, this machine is here, the omcopter with his eight propellers, a exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What do you do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is just symmetric.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">Thereby he receives the equestrian ability;</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction it is filmed or even how he rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is available in models, the rest is learns directly at the Flies."</seg>
<seg id="450">See you this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one build them, they act like a high-performance-Quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue flying, although limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by one half of them.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic carpets.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took customary Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disk of bread -- and provide them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">"every unit is white, where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The especially safe machine there dryme would like to be a flying light lampshade at Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of these technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types of as us lies the reward in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, as wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, allowing them to form so spectacular ways."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such solid commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake."</seg>

<seg id="482">"in the following time, the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased, making the power output enormously improved."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced LIGO.</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my token's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, it was the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">All this for what I did not have worked is no longer science-fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigated for 23 years of Gravitational waves from black holes and their by observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. but what are Gravitational waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a magnificence in the emotional of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">At the temporary the shaft the space and its entire content is stretched into a direction and into the other gesture.</seg>
<seg id="495">"to the illustration, lecturers in courses for the Relative theory often have a real bercultured dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves is extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>

<seg id="503">"but physicist are erfinally and with the support of the public, all the obstacles are overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">"back to LIGO. Scott maintains, LIGO be more than an eye."</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visual light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than things around us: factions, the size of your hand."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. for this way you can create an image or a map of things by watching it from several points of upcoming light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">In tones is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible notes have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things to make it particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>

<seg id="514">"now, speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob downward it."</seg>
<seg id="516">"Sorrow Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot manufacture with them a simple pictures of objects in the All.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by clicking on changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are the frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"if we thus convert wave-pattern in Schall, we can literally speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, making my colleague Scott already very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, tropics simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turning the two body very quickly, one can hear the same paterpillars with an extra sound change. that sounds like to: Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>

<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I have never forgotten -- heard LIGO: [Surrendes Unit] Jemand, who knows how to hear it, recognises this as the noise of -- SH:... two black holes, each round as the sticks of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: consider ourselves briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dichotomniest body in the universe, one with a mass of 29 sonnen, the other with a mass of 36 pencils, circles around one hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine that forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>

<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massert stars in Supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we learned a lot about all of them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical events occur however in the core, which is behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron, as it would be more transparent glass. the Urcro: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see, as the Urcrall is covered by his own afterlights."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational waves, it should be possible to drop down to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen that we have never seen before, and by whom we do not have any idea. things we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found right in the first attempt things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: ME: the type of stars, the black holes, such as LIGO they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, old body from prehistoric times. the black holes are soaring for our archeological work. "</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO enables us to make a completely different point of view to the events in space, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>

<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Wanted to begin with the shows?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, wovor I feared, leaving my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"to keep my fear, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a particular yes that my life deeply changed, on an unknown species. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" "kittens,"</seg>
<seg id="570">It would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"guys, I need milk for my beak-ass."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the jump. and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">That Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new way of life in my family. from there I sweep me to play with them, once you call me. no matter what I am doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I painted very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an intriguing side effect: first of short I was actually complete that the" Yes "-Sages for playing with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author. I think things, awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I revolve television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible to carry out 70 hours program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"every program offers hundreds of jobs, which before it existed."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, i.e., every nine days 20 million dollar TV, four TV programs, four episodes: scanning, 15 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television was going to each other on Thursday night.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created themselves, and not just fine. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans at campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who this still makes?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Traumjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it because I know what you think, if the word" author falls. ""</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you all of you who work so hard, whether you have a firm, a land or a classroom, so that I am talking about my work, so that you understand that I am not just about the computer and fantasive, and it is right if I say, I don't understand that it is not going for a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- not tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I have deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from the nothingness.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I put troops on as malte I on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So called a high sound, liefe a marathon. "</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and undisturbed, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, and the best of it, is the Summon."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working out well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums of sound sounds like a busy road, I could always go to her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take them when I perceive them the swamply that I overwrite writing, that writing will give me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong, this does it. "</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began with the television production, when I began to work and to work and work to create, create and working together, I discovered this thing, this Summon, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The Summon is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a Summon, you cannot do otherwise than on size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not different to be able to strive as to size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the Summon.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know it.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I am not afraid that I am not afraid, and I just know that I love the Summon."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know that I do not want it to ask."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to clear one clear: the more successful I will, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more work there are, the more things the more time, the more do I have story, the more expectations there are story."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land, which I learnt the marathon that I walk, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this swamp. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the swamp.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this swamp?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then it stops the sums.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overlaid, covered, hidden."</seg>
<seg id="642">The marthmen stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single working place."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mother will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda country."</seg>
<seg id="646">They are the children of a Titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are baby-Titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the marthmen listened."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was hidden.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The swamp came not back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My marthmen was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titanium-work, 15 hours-days, graduated weekends, no relucent, a titanium sleeps, there is not on, with all heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sump.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a pre-show-Titan</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the swamp and the swamp was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you so, when what you do, the work you love, suddenly forfaded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think," "Heul you out, blowing the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you are doing what to do, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, and knows how the sums of sums you know, when the sums of sums you know, if the sums stops, who is then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart is listening, I can survive in the silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern states waitress" into a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late dran and she says," Mama, magic you playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I already want to say No, as I can be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"it calls no one more" "kittens." ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I popped it, when I am Titan and my sums bets, and here all changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, Est you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters also encounter a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops "." "</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the swings, I can do nothing but to fit."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focussed.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land, which I learnt the marathon that I walk, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists is sticky finger and moist kisses, delicate voices, vigilstiff and the song, where it is going to leave, or whatever the girl in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens up and an energy bank comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes slowly back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it is quiet, barely audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">"and now I feel, when I would know a magical secret."</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us remain with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. this is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only Love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the Titanium, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask who you are, if I tell you, who I am when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours and how is capable of my brain, then I forgot what the real sums."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the pleasure.</seg>
<seg id="709">True sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The Summon is the river that comes from the lifestlust.</seg>
<seg id="711">True sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true sums ignored the pressure of the story, which too erledieting tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">True sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true sums of God is the voice of my ear, but perhaps God inspires me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am an Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a rule that I can rid myself as a workaholic of any debt.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play me not ansatTwo, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth does hurt.</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work in the workplace as a daddy.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this understanding is painful, because what kind of man works rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"now yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"time honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I must have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden around, before and back, towards and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance Parties.</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We shredded soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mainly stiffness, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">"however, it is o.k."</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe filled me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever hear about playing games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also call it! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me for naïve for a servant.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my babies want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they are feared, that they want to make something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes I replaced a mariennifer or Keks.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and my Teenie-daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more requires it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can bring 15 minutes on the play, even at a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children finished."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-dogs, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the Summon to have a place for his soul-peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not going to play with their own children. it is about joy;</seg>
<seg id="759">To play the "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I shaken and I siege. friends meet, books read, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I got up, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training when I wanted to make myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes in the play, why not full 15 minutes treat yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The swamp came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I am not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Works not without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I listen to new ideas. I listen to new ideas. I nutt it in full breaches and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sums of sums it is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>

<seg id="778">"it is me schnäppe that I have a titanium. I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and to play more play.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my bearing is still burning.</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this swamply, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new living things in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this swamp, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and to play more play.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanium have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">As most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a serious stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "low-sea stimulation". "in the case, one implanted an electric drive in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that neurological function improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson that suffered from hefarious trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was conductive supervisor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I reconciled patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that at Schädel-Hirn-Traumata the brain rises and the skull pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">"for this, you sometimes need to remove a part of the swollen brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of taking the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells of a tissue piece grow, is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many publishers it took Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw he under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a regular cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you still know from the BiologyPrivate Tuition, that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into any cell type of organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprisingly to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly split up and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cellaring, which looked like stem cells, but differently kept differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They date from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our grandbrain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why stay they get to us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, since we find them in higher concentrations close to brain violations."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source, the brain healing. "</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove it.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then put the cells exactly as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then select it to mark them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step we reimplanted them at the demolition of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the self-sufficient transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">"one of our first questions was: what happens when we reimplant these cells in normal brain tissue, and what will happen when we reimplant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?"</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkey.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario reimplanted, we watched the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched it after a few weeks ago, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not go there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we put an injury to and reimplanted exactly the same cells, and now the cells will get to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">"these are the cells, which were reimplanted."</seg>
<seg id="862">"the proof that they show, are these small points. these are the cells that we in vitro, in the culture colored."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Help these cells also to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual creation task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take spinning pellets of one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"as they achieved a stable level of action, we have reached the craft cortex in the motor motor Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, she recovered spontaneously, as far as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of sculptural brain mechanisms. they are at some degree, just as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure that the monkey had achieved a degree of spontaneous rest, implanted us his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left they see the monkey who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and later use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal themselves."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, which is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I will definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on the human."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one has to fill about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look at the future -- you have finished research and tried to get the permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future how many years will take it until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select patients to conduct treatments and rate, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first show that it is useful before you can offer this treatment every time.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne - thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as unchanging opponents.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great reahmer in Beijing have definitely proven that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while the policy remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, the democracy disappear with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clear that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programmes which were realised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party, or some of my redeemed friends, who would repeat me that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"please, together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a mistic, we could save democracy but that we need a true and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies become one, our future, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"for the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened by our companies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I nenne it the "twins-summit-paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt of Schuldenberg, who throws its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all see the debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">Yet few are recognizing its twilling.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which, however, is anxious to invest, however, where it would be productive and income where it could be productive and income, with which one could need to produce the debt relief and also all the things needed mankind, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months in the U.S., in England and in the euro zone, 3,4 Billionen died, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, roads, quiet, equipment, and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 Billionen U.S. dollar sounds too much money until one compares around 5.4 Billionen in the same time, and absolutely nothing in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"in this way debts and unproductive capital make the twist summit, which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is a stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe labour, which, in which they do not invest, in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus Father, who would not invest in which they would kill him if he will kill him if he will grow."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unwavered, the circumstances lead to it that oedipus kills him kills."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my haze with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely actal art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve human talents, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies, which are decisive for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe it. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy is defined as the form of society in which the open and poor as a majority control government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy is of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, there would be a mistake to decrease the significance of the athetic democracy due to these connections."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision-based on the athetic democracy was and is that they gave the working poor, but more important and crucial that they have the right to freedom of expression with the same tuning in questions of citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not been kept for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"as a candle, which is very bright, it is also quickly hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies have not their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the athetic democracy focused on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for ruling class."</seg>
<seg id="940">"because the liberal democracy came only on, as a full separation between politics and business is possible and the democratic process was bordered on politics, while the economy is the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an unprecedented fight between the two, and the economy gradually emigrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians no longer like it?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because you cannot be in the government nowadays, and nevertheless not in power, because the power of politics into the economy is unvandered and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haze with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about such a herd of carnivores that nourished so sustainably the animals, from which they are nourished, decayed that they are at the end so starring."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that realizes the policy so far. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, the inequality increases, the overall economic demand is falling and the managing director of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" Demos "" [the people] from democracy sells, the higher the twist summit, and the greater the disuse of human labour power and the welfare of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is evident that we have to bring the politics and the economy back, and it would be better when the" Demos "has kept control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea about 100 years ago and it did not come.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a miracle, as in the antique Athens without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by being replaced by riedriglohnCreation by means of automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics separate areas, the automation will become more deeply, the wastage of the habitation, and the social conflicts deeper than I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reforming the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and we consider that we can restore the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a disease hyperautocracy that can appear to the film" "matrix" "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not, whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he brought forth to survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a diystine, similar to the" "matrix", "in which machines serve the human being and people in the study of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what does it happen, how could it look like this" "Star Trek" "like utopia instead of the" "matrix" "like similar Dystopy?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples soon."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: ask a capital market in which one deserves money while you work and in which your capital will work you from a working place to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who have currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and from dissolve and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction more between those who belong to companies, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, but not any clue more between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and diaries, and ultimately no undraging twist summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please shortly before that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which will be issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to traded that the entire world trade in that currency -- call it" "Cosmos" "in units of" "Cosmos" "-- and any government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade overcast of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world, in which investment is rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically that what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you, is at the same time liberated, in which it is preferred people, and Marxist, because they buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"or will we reconcile into a" "matrix" "- similar Dystopy?"</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to work together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">"regards,"</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... do we do not, technological development will produce such a massive decrease of overall economic demand, what elry Summers are referred to as" long term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we're currently experiencing it, there will not only be our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"similarly as Hayek, so I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also complete."</seg>

<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the author of a democracy.</seg>

<seg id="994">"in some ways, when I may say this provocative, China today resembles China today in the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- please remember -- we tend to link liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of this have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for a lot of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to decision that met Roy three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is conductive employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshing and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for the shows and content creation, the Amazon will produce."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-contested industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot find any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are quite right on this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating dates from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows how" breaking Bad "," The Wire "-- all the shows, the addictive, where, after one has a season, your brain asks," where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should say enough what goes on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to teach" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts on the mean expression, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply amaze it."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is also the first time that Amazon as something makes, therefore Roy Price does not risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs a guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch everyone free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon have nothing to be out there, but if you want to get right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look forward to this episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed in the sight of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team all take up.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when one fails, which parts you will be jumping or once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show it should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and hence the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of this show can remember because it was not as good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this turn is 7,4 is and Alpha House landers at 7.5 -- so somewhat above average, but not exactly what is advertised in Roy and his team."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"approximately at the same time at a different company, another manager is involved through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for finding this a super show, and he also uses data for it, but he makes it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hold a competition, he and his team have the available data on the Netflix spectators, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find these little details about the spectators: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a wagon and decided to do not a Sitcom at four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this turn. so exactly where they wanted. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course the question is: what happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow tenders that this should work in all.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collects millions of data for a decision that one meets, then one should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a Back-Up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized with very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then this is something terrifying because we live in a time where we take more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one comes in this space ever in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in prison and to dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, will be a person good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, which may be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results created. this is not that a company like multi-Health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data diversified companies are false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google does sometimes make mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that they can say through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the schlimmen's way, with data analysis of Google Search."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderful and was a big messing. the success of success in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year round year, until suddenly there was no longer working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply does not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data quickly assemble companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes understand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these faults data is influential in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the rule of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather ensure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable many data to make serious decisions such as the decision for cancer therapy!"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you have to solve a complex problem, do you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first put this problem into its parts, so that you can analyze the parts; as a whole, you put the parts again to write a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take away and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to enforce the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we own it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete to write a good emptying -- especially if it's the brain's brain."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think was Netflix so successful because they have data and sensibility, where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to better understand their audience, what else would not have been able to exist, but the decision how to put all these parts again, and make it a show like" House of Cards "," this was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all their decisions, first as they competed on TV-ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and in order not to be forgotten, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely "-- just here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will make it a bit later with a technology.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much balance, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this is not changing the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"that way, the ball is clever and clever and clever. ultimately, it is possible to make choices when we want to reach something unusual at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays, making decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks, with which you land at the right end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
