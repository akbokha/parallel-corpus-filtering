Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ stalt where young people are to meet today .
a greeting chapel where now is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small @-@ garden@@ er manage the one &apos;s reason for farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories to days .
it nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; this knows everyone who had to rain itself already , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i instead of a pru@@ dent road showed a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bavaria At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als of Bavaria , is anything but current - but that is why it is very enlight@@ ening . &quot;
especially when you compar@@ es them with up @-@ to @-@ date maps .
&quot; then , how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Mer@@ cury since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one is not recogni@@ zes as such .
&quot; the big picture postcard were provided for towns and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called Ur@@ posi@@ ums . &quot;
these were created according to the Bav@@ arian closure management between 1810 and 1864 and jumping from the first Ver@@ messung of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Ko@@ ali@@ d War with Austria .
Napoleon wants an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ &apos;s in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if French troops have finally lifted with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , it was today &apos;s neighbours that created the idea of a surface of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max I@@ V. Joseph drove the project further forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ oper . &quot;
the Certificate for Munich comes from the year of 1856 and is like all other on the website of the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ library .
the comparison early / Today is the example of the provincial capital on the impressive .
the city has stretched itself into all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ s@@ end@@ ling that is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was initiated 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as Mün@@ ch@@ ner district . &quot;
today Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses under@@ s@@ end@@ ling lies around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader in the insur@@ rection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the west @-@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance : when Hin@@ no@@ o@@ omes appears a small @-@ piece map with dozen lines and numbers : hand @-@ written flags from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; , &quot; derived from that the basic tax is derived . &quot;
small plots have no farmers today - but small garden@@ er of the facility &quot; land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of Unter@@ s@@ end@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wiese , since 1810 show of the Oc@@ to@@ ber@@ ests , was in the 19th century still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of the psychi@@ atric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the judg@@ ement leaf can be read in the territory of today &apos;s districts A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; &quot; at the guest &quot; &quot; or from the app@@ endi@@ x &quot; &quot; on the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ stalt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ fel@@ straße you were once visited people with mad@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; there was 1858 / 59 the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ an@@ stalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Ventil@@ ation . &quot;
from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden the institution - that psy@@ chi@@ ater was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwi@@ gs .
&quot; he was progressive for his time , and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; he also has forbidden to access the personnel , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged in the institution for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients was first place , later was enlarged on 500 places . &quot;
some@@ time even this capacity is no longer considered - the reason for the construction of the circulation of the roundabout in hair 1905 .
&quot; there is the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of the biggest Psy@@ chi@@ at@@ ry in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the former Au@@ er An@@ stalt , young people encounter with the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
the Order was in 1920 and turned it into a youth @-@ house with apprentic@@ eships .
&quot; west is the football ground of the T@@ SV Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children of &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was designed in an architectural approach to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ an@@ stalt , which was destroyed during World War II at Bom@@ ben@@ ang@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the Marien@@ platz was for 1856 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the merchants of the name was called &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change carried out the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the Bom@@ bs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 many holes in the city center .
one big remained until today - at the Marien@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marien@@ hof , where these days were working on and on 5 April 2017 the sp@@ aten@@ sti@@ ch for the second S @-@ Bahn route . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich card can be compared with the air picture of today - and fill the hole in the Marien@@ berg . &quot;
citizen &apos;s group published col@@ oring for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Color@@ ant has issued a warning for colored people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the Federal State Mis@@ sour@@ i , who shall come into force on 28 August 2017 , calling for A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , because a number of frag@@ mentary , r@@ age @-@ based inci@@ dents in recent times occur throughout the state and noted that it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes people severe to gain discrimination , as well as the enforcement authorities of the State , the dis@@ proportion@@ ate to minorities , prom@@ pted the group to extract the back@@ bone , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are kept for their skin colour , they are mer@@ ged or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ansas City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear discomfort in such cases , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning which issued the organization for a state in the US .
&quot; the group c@@ ited inci@@ dents like rac@@ ist susp@@ ending against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ ennes@@ see . &quot;
&quot; sin died in frag@@ mentary circumstances beginning of the year after having had no gas@@ oline any more , and taken from the police by Mis@@ sour@@ i in prison , without a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report of the office of the General Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be willing to bring it to Kau@@ b , or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i conf@@ essions in 2015 100 H@@ ass@@ ver@@ break , according to the latest figures from the H@@ ass@@ ver@@ bre@@ ur @-@ reporting program of the F@@ BI , which cat@@ ches the state with regard to the number of such injury to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
travel ar@@ den@@ ial is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i Law that would make it harder to do a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union had been issued for the European Civil Liber@@ ties for Texas and Arizona , having passed the local pro@@ secution authorities to keep people due to immigration violations , resulting in view of AC@@ LU to further ration@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Reis@@ ew@@ ar@@ calculations tend to be issued by the State Department for other countries , but in recent times interested parties have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ discreet project is elementary
the Fisher@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac have created a picture on site .
&quot; with the rect@@ angle of the family Schwen@@ dem@@ ann met representatives of the fishing village CD@@ U local associations , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two parliam@@ ent@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ dem@@ ann affor@@ ds first insights into its operation , in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest managed , 40 milk cooling and also houses many vir@@ gins and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
at the table of the holiday guests only comes to Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; as it is also a BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Fisher@@ bach , he describes the whe@@ els@@ ets project as &quot; el@@ ement@@ ar . &quot; &quot;
I can not profit on such parts .
the green area care for a lot of work that can be edited by Motor@@ sense .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; stressed Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the el@@ ter@@ nal operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he does not run any bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognised the meaning of the woman &apos;s regime and is pleased with the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hect@@ are , the farmers had to be supported . &quot;
you hope that the re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of the areas could still be moved out for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they continued their operations , &quot; stressed the may@@ or . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of promotion
more than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 and 25 plots from eleven participants in 2013 .
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that will not be re@@ af@@ folding until at least 2023 .
&quot; from the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half of the Leader was funded , a quarter carried out the village of fishing . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers love 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of wife . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ dem@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ovac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ men it does not go . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White was fixed : &quot; &quot; here the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ sc@@ apes ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Württemberg .
the goal is to be the disclosure of the Black Forest .
requirement is the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked by the conveyor belt .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ und@@ oc@@ ative area must not be low @-@ per@@ sec@@ recy ( H@@ ang@@ tend to be over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by the re@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence at the moment . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is 35 hectares , the cold costs are at more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty .
&quot; the saf@@ est character of a regime change is , if they begin to att@@ acking the stat@@ ues . &quot;
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the fall of Saddam Hus@@ sein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Mill@@ er , one of the key ide@@ ologies of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did , when he did a symbo@@ lic war with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
to remain fair , Mill@@ er does not hold the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of j@@ at@@ owners and Liberty Cap@@ it@@ ators would have suffered it when he would have done it .
&quot; but he handles their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Mill@@ er A@@ co@@ sta , I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world is illuminated . &quot;
the poem that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Mill@@ er is properly true , but as he wor@@ sen it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the infl@@ ected words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only have any ancient immigrants , but the hass@@ le of the poor : &quot; &quot; your wicked , your arms , / your afflic@@ ted masses , which then lon@@ ging to breathe , and the el@@ ending waste of your rich co@@ asts . &quot;
&quot; there was never a time , in which the &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable Ab@@ fall &quot; &quot; was to be seen on our screens better . &quot;
Mill@@ er did not engaged in liter@@ ary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp@@ s USA .
this conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural argument : it is indeed a conflict to the significance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who sat down their words after her death on the base - knew very well that they were a highly @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ an@@ ism by presented the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of Liberty .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has got a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and an devast@@ ating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , the people wanted to change this far from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the big scre@@ aming as Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , ar@@ gu@@ ed 2010 , that the freedom of the Statue is not sing@@ ular , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ co@@ on@@ serv@@ ative that the American fl@@ am@@ me into the um@@ re@@ ated world bri@@ inge : &quot; Lady Liberty is going forward . &quot;
it is supposed to bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not shine the way to the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ gra@@ gh here on something aw@@ ake .
the significance of the statue is quite a question of the stand@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consi@@ sted of Lazarus as they seen by the exhaus@@ tive , el@@ ending , but hop@@ eful people were seen after long and often terrible trips to the Dec@@ ks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is true in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of men , the refu@@ ge and an opportunity to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and of course , this is not the perspective that Mill@@ er and Tru@@ mp would ever acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their tor@@ ch should not shine the path , but the hat@@ red , who is their only source of power , ign@@ ite . &quot;
WH@@ C 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scot@@ tish Members of the Great Britain
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle re@@ members a time , when only two caves to the team of Great Britain belon@@ ged to &quot;
&quot; the power @-@ Director of the Light@@ weight of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ k@@ nu@@ tic con@@ ting@@ ent in the World Championships can make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scot@@ tish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that in Scotland has to learn something special , and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people in the Scot@@ tish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scot@@ tish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scot@@ tish athletes , medals are medals , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah , while E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle was elected by the team for team@@ rider . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is pretty modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were sh@@ ot@@ tically or wherever they live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh completely included , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth @-@ silver medal , which is in its fifth world championship with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; &quot; incredibly &quot; &quot; that 16 Sh@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ screw @-@ runners Mu@@ ir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,@@ 500 m and the 5.000 m of the furn@@ ace . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,@@ 500 m is another Sch@@ otte , which one was after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games included . &quot;
Do@@ yle members remember their first world championship as the only other Sch@@ otte in the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain said that they are &quot; enorm@@ ously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only a team but in some cases also in the medals and join the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special about team captain , lies in that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honor , but knowing that my team col@@ ates for me and have chosen to make it something special for me &quot; , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the ra@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we got .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ des . &quot;
what my speech as a captain affects ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are back at the Olympi@@ ast@@ adi@@ on . &quot;
I &apos;m going to go out a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there .
blo@@ cking of critics via Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b will not carry you a public office if you cannot wear the he@@ ater of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long before the newspapers ask him because of everything from the internal policy up to his political principles . &quot;
he sh@@ aking during the cri@@ tique .
but he has not brought his critics to silence .
&quot; for the year 1783 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stup@@ id and st@@ um@@ m we are led as the sheep to battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland govern@@ or Lar@@ ry H@@ og@@ an who must work on it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union def@@ ends him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the strip of the govern@@ or tun@@ ed the law@@ suit as an fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ re@@ traction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a publi@@ can govern@@ or in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the two th@@ est agreement of the 50 Govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a reactionary p@@ inion .
he demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very sent to use Facebook as a pri@@ mor@@ res , to connect with his voters and play their hairy head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore the block@@ ation of persons who come to the side of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker Amel@@ ia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Govern@@ ors and ar@@ gu@@ ing that the block@@ ation of the comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tropical or sp@@ amm@@ ers or sp@@ lash @-@ filled people that goes online the p@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a master and a priest , no tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; they all told that their comments are respec@@ t@@ ful , thought@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest c@@ ited the Bible in his post and sent to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
&quot; Law@@ y@@ tin Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ like , MD . , was not h@@ asser@@ tive , but she asked about h@@ ass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate break and other current news , &quot; wrote them in the commentary box of the post @-@ announcement &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject take place , then they are dis@@ regarded by some more likely than a so called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; would possibly call &quot; &quot; speech &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a crime , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of clean@@ ers than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that staff was sent , to collect and burn newspapers with critical leadership and to per@@ su@@ ade and to swe@@ ep the prot@@ esters . &quot;
but that is exactly what exactly is happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public official who critic@@ ised the Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is charged by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County Ver@@ last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they called a voters of their Facebook page . &quot;
and K@@ entu@@ cky received Govern@@ or Matt Be@@ vin ( R ) also a visit from AC@@ PI because of its use by Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the time of Washington the time of affordable port@@ tos had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers often multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous brief@@ s on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had Tro@@ ll@@ me Tro@@ lle .
&quot; people , the pseu@@ don@@ y@@ me such as Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us &quot; , &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , the Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; petition that has critic@@ ised its position on the contract of am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain and critic@@ ised his ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements and disco@@ urses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty ho@@ ists on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raf@@ fer@@ ty will hope for the next three days to home comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an will be the 25th edition of Scot@@ tish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , which led in the past year next to the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the end , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is bound up against Paul E@@ ales and serves as a tournament amb@@ assador on behalf of the club @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , said Raf@@ fer@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry did a great job than he placed this place .
he is a self @-@ free@@ ze dis@@ astro@@ us of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; British E@@ ales are looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won his 32 @-@ year career in his 32 @-@ year career as well as the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels especially well , &quot; said to the South@@ port native players . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , as it was in the year after I had won it out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year for the European Senior Tour , returns to the home round . &quot;
this event will be his first Scot@@ tish performance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scot@@ tish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it &apos;s always a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how far has gone .
&quot; with the trio at the field , the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Bro@@ adh@@ ur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup @-@ captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sh@@ ines on the field , the others are Andrew Vintage corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and R@@ oss Drum@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking lot is £ 5 per car with an extra bed and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds from Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less black@@ boards through passi@@ v@@ smoke
in the past two decades less than less people died due to passi@@ vity of lung cancer .
to this result researchers come to the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ ke ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year 167 of 167 pul@@ mon@@ gers are attributed to passive sei@@ zu@@ res , &quot; said Study of Hei@@ ko Be@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this topic from 1994 . &quot;
at that time there are still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ic cases because of Passi@@ v@@ tsi to Germany per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
app@@ en@@ closures prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; somewhat less in time , &quot; &quot; thus the leader of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of house@@ wives , the location is more complicated as susp@@ ected , as in the substr@@ ate a lot ver@@ berge , which is not stated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which again hin@@ ders the building work , represents a big problem for the Bau@@ tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the Ig@@ nor@@ ance of mot@@ orists in front of red traffic and bol@@ lar@@ ds is already enormous , &quot; tells Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in Indonesian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ gei cooked dinner and they do not use stove .
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele , located in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually sets a sweet@@ ener - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the red @-@ red b@@ olle becomes removed with ei@@ gh@@ ous , un@@ washed hands and decreased . &quot;
&quot; De@@ gei is sitting on the floor floor - it has no furniture - where they also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with drink water from the nearby sw@@ amp to wash . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless space serves as a lat@@ ine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned to any fields . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ ie is common here .
&quot; of course , late too work can be dangerous : most vill@@ ers are un@@ employed , and many drink heavy , and there are here the soldiers . &quot;
&quot; nobody wa@@ ited it after 17 pm in the village , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 El@@ ders should vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that sur@@ rounds the independence against the Dutch rule , turned quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control over the region and ex@@ cludes foreign journalists or legal observation of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially split into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New gu@@ ine@@ as the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as se@@ cluded as it is ö@@ de . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there are no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ .000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , which are surrounded by bamboo , and made of corru@@ g@@ ated ro@@ oft@@ ops that were converted by R@@ ost in different yellow @-@ brown t@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; only very few of pizza , made their journey here , so@@ jour@@ ned because journalists and practically no fore@@ igners . &quot;
before Christian Mission@@ aries arrived , ver@@ nissage Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ GA Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to wear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ gei and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dar@@ kl@@ es Hem@@ d and her light rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesian province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst ap@@ ol@@ ality rates en@@ rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian &apos;s gold .
&quot; the biggest and most profitable gold mine of the world , weed , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a coastal province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Free@@ port has built the value of 3.8 billion US dollars Gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua dispos@@ es of wood &apos;s resources valued at 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these rich@@ es are however a source of mis@@ ery for the Pap@@ ua , which ensure that Indonesian and a military presence preserved . &quot;
&quot; a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that free@@ port local military units and units ranging from 1998 to 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ vian demands for greater autonomy threat@@ ening these golden gl@@ ans and are treated mer@@ ci@@ ful .
&quot; according to the statements of acti@@ vi@@ sts , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua had been killed and thousands have been rolled together since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
mass@@ ac@@ ent@@ aries in Pap@@ uas stem @-@ hoch@@ land during the 1970 @-@ 10 years were in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission to commit geno@@ cide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police in the past year has more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; we wer@@ ve all . &quot; &quot; we say it in a report of the Arch@@ b@@ ishop@@ ric Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities did not contain , such as un@@ law@@ ful j@@ ig@@ s and torture - r@@ ape and electro@@ des are especially popular with a different report - and the brut@@ al precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week inci@@ dents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have strengthened itself since Pap@@ uas resources have an influ@@ x of settl@@ ers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is too 83 % Christian , but dem@@ ographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants of the pop@@ ulate islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ anese War@@ ung @-@ Kant@@ inen has selling chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with earth @-@ sauce . &quot;
local people are struggling to participate .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year Pan@@ i@@ ai invasion , who moved into the province capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - their market costs . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the masses and as a Jok@@ ow@@ i , he sp@@ ake at his election in 2014 the ine@@ qualities and the legal violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals make che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts have broken because we have been tun@@ ed for Jok@@ ow@@ i with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; actually , Pan@@ i@@ ai had only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October a deep @-@ point . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 was a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness bra@@ ve . &quot;
the sc@@ ared children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took part in their sound and later came back with four soldiers , so the local past@@ or Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had dr@@ unk , hun@@ ted and sm@@ ote the group with their gun , they said to be victims and witnesses . &quot;
&quot; then , one of the soldiers were in the group of children . &quot;
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to be@@ aten that he fell into the Kom@@ a . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set in fire and set things at the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military @-@ mand@@ ment centre to challenge justice . &quot;
she bore sh@@ em@@ oni@@ onic Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle and a bird@@ watching - by the Pap@@ uas Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some prot@@ esters began to wor@@ sen stones of police and military signs .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers was sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses were more than three times , they shoot it dead , called it in an official document of T@@ IME that has not been released the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ Quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ p@@ ent danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly turned into my left wr@@ ist wr@@ ist , &quot; he said T@@ IME on the veranda of his colour@@ ful wood@@ house . &quot;
&quot; kay@@ ak does not know who flow@@ ed , but says that the ball came out of the ranks of the here gathered soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fil@@ tered , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the local husband Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ous@@ in , the witness of the aw@@ ay@@ ings was . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ked to him and studied his body to safely walk that he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who bears as many pizza , the T@@ IME in d@@ ü@@ ster@@ er mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have k@@ issed it .
&quot; the Che@@ fin@@ spec@@ tor of Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ ters that his officers wanted to secure their station just &quot; &quot; to ensure they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people dro@@ w us to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of Pap@@ ua Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators have been killed and many others have been wo@@ unded . &quot;
the news about the k@@ ill@@ ings arrived only on the next day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks stayed Jok@@ ow@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura a passionate speech , in which he sympath@@ etic to the families of the victims and vibr@@ ating the historical mis@@ states in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be resolved right away , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he took a extra @-@ out mechanism for the draft of historic human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the pron@@ unci@@ ations began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle this violations , but there are processes that have to run through . &quot;
then he made a retreat than he spoke on 5 June in Jak@@ arta with T@@ IME and said he did not al@@ ign plans in Pap@@ ua a complaint mechanism .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , which was charged the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua had already been attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai Pre@@ inci@@ dent . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ ev@@ ous un@@ believers .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am anxi@@ ous to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us re@@ peti@@ te the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the inci@@ dent .
&quot; he says that he was be@@ aten by the military , after he helped to buried four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the army sought after me &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
the p@@ hili@@ pp@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who so@@ aked to the hospital , a person and 17 other were wo@@ unded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was dr@@ unken , when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
non @-@ standing vill@@ agers is prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers saw stones on officers , who re@@ acted it by warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a de@@ fi@@ red .
&quot; we were so in pan@@ ic , we are afraid that there will be reven@@ ge &quot; , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Badi@@ i who lives near the hospital and stuff was , as the last here was quickly delivered here , so the T@@ IME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden myself two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai @-@ parliament has called to account the officers involved and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a cru@@ de for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ al development strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al that live in the green highlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) to defend the reb@@ els , who claims the rights of Pap@@ ua by stim@@ ulated by spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM guides date from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbit@@ r@@ ary in prison , under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some will never dive back .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a trag@@ ic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strength@@ ens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is sold for locals . &quot;
bread is just as well .
the people here are building everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five fields of confection@@ ery .
they retain the bulk of harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a tast@@ ings only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants emerged since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to better educated and weal@@ thy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of reporting international media are charged . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ l Long@@ ch@@ amp were noted for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they have been given the rare permission to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ins , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is elect@@ oral campaigns to up@@ lift the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesian and eastern provinces from Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua to report : visa @-@ promise and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ uas .
&quot; in March of the six p@@ acific States - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , the &quot; &quot; different and widely spread injury &quot; &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooter . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian State Department Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r dism@@ issed the pre@@ fers of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to dism@@ iss the evidence of human rights . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take notice of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ botanical garden of K@@ ees Van B@@ aar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on 4th May visited , bra@@ ve locals to participate in the meeting , &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has got another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably will not be right again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ issing , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the constant threat of a rough military , in its ar@@ ming and healthcare services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people said , like other Pap@@ ua , their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; gu@@ ilt &quot; that he must return . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai she@@ ave made a last symbo@@ lic act of Trotsky : the corp@@ ses of an O@@ pf@@ ile was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they might never know that they may never forget justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with soci@@ able head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scrap@@ ers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest thous@@ es of the world in Dubai in his break@@ down and forced hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ sto@@ rey building to fle@@ e . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire which cat@@ ched in just two years by the high @-@ house , which you acci@@ dentally call the tor@@ ch @-@ Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we are in fire , and when scre@@ aming of the people stood up . &quot;
&quot; we ran@@ ked the stairs , and it lasted about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th floor to bottom , &quot; &quot; told a resident , who has its name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ u@@ ters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civi@@ liz@@ ations spoke that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 pm GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building burned down .
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those concerned . &quot;
inci@@ dent may have questions about the safety of materials that are used in outside sky@@ scrap@@ ers throughout the world .
&quot; a study conducted by the management of the tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 , that the largest part of the damage from the fair@@ ing , the outside cl@@ adding for decor@@ ating or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fur @-@ tower in June to have contributed to the rapid spread of a Bran@@ des in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Monetary Union ( IT@@ F ) is established with its big Davis Cup Cou@@ p in the Annual General Meeting .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h city , that was supported for this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup range only to play two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the although often very long , but even so very appreciated five @-@ set @-@ classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 percent of member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only barely justified . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these icon@@ ic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work to improve the competition .
&quot; even if the vote was not only before the vote , the final suggestion was on a neutral place before the proposal . &quot;
&quot; new since 2018 , only compar@@ atively smaller details : thus the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be able to have the host @-@ right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training courses etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to receive fewer official media events before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travellers bring bot@@ her@@ ed items to the plane you find a survey
&quot; a survey conducted under aircraft consi@@ sted that over 20 percent are conscious or un@@ conscious objects to the control points of the US Transportation Security administration , including at least 6 percent , which charges the aircraft while watching b@@ anned kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent maintained , they would have del@@ ayed that they have been irrit@@ ated with she@@ pher@@ ds , am@@ mun@@ ition or explo@@ si@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; survey with more than 1,000 people - which has been performed by a Jet @-@ charter service , the STR@@ ATOS jet Char@@ ters Inc . , performed - was also fixed that younger travellers want mis@@ use the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents , the supplements that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that were b@@ anned by T@@ SA were 19,@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that were sent to T@@ SA agents , were inten@@ tionally inten@@ tionally , foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent said to , kno@@ w@@ ingly objects with blades by the security control , while 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents , and 3,@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had brought out @-@ bot@@ her@@ ed drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have ques@@ tioned travellers around the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally sm@@ ug@@ gling brought by the airport security and how many of it had done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people , the most common sm@@ ug@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or ignor@@ ant - by security wear , those were the most common . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are something complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ ure which liquids they may take with or how much of it .
&quot; so , it is not a surprise that the greatest amount of those affected by the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items are bot@@ her@@ ed liquids . &quot;
&quot; a time for the people , the T@@ SA could view books as a sm@@ ug@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : t@@ ens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Clients / Order
electric @-@ Exchange El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to give the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has now signed that a part of the customer has already with@@ drawn its non @-@ binding reservation already . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ um@@ phant figures ahead of sales growth and even gigantic co@@ aches , Tes@@ la @-@ Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k on the announcement of the recent quarterly assessment for the first time a different , less lac@@ kl@@ ed number : the cancellation of the new mass market @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k had frequently used over 500,000 orders for the new car in recent months , whose delivery is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k a : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been returned to 63@@ .000 . &quot;
critics always had pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
a cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 Po@@ und ) .
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5.000 such non @-@ binding reservations are pre @-@ binding reservations , spati@@ al mus@@ k in a telephone conference with an@@ alysts . &quot;
&quot; that cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be changed to the problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge for the ambitious growth aim is not on demand , but on the production site . &quot;
in the last year Tes@@ la 84@@ .000 vehicles from .
&quot; 2018 , 2018 - all models were picked up - 500@@ .000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , each day 1800 bookings are to be made . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; in the second half of 2018 with the delivery - if Tes@@ la creates its brand new , never even in practice tested manufacturing roads without greater interru@@ ptions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts have to doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , there will be too much del@@ ays , then the in@@ binding of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent un@@ satisfied customers in sc@@ ars . &quot;
EP@@ A @-@ Chief Pru@@ let moves to the reduction of the rules of Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been charged of 15 states , Scott Pru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his former decision to delay the implementation of the rules of Obama era to delay the emissions of smo@@ g caused det@@ ach@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; pru@@ dence presented the shift , when his agency proved to be compared to the needs of state environmental authorities to re@@ acting more quickly than previous administration . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit against his previous place in a Bundes@@ minister@@ ial court .
&quot; it is a time limit , which ran on 1 October for States to adh@@ ere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ less Oz@@ on . &quot;
&quot; it also declared compliance in June , that he will be hes@@ it@@ ating for a year to study the plan more time to study the plan and avoid investing in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; Pru@@ gn@@ ation , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp State University from Okl@@ ahoma , was a long time a reliable opponent in accordance with environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , Pru@@ gn@@ ation had to blo@@ cking or delay , regul@@ ating or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossi@@ l fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion from Wednesday is the recent legal tender to the Pru@@ section regulatory Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month has decided a Bundes@@ liga court in Washington that the EP@@ A car@@ et@@ aker has exce@@ eded its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ lec@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; in one on the evening of the post statement , Pru@@ d@@ ently proposed that his revers@@ al at O@@ zon@@ e.@@ just simply put the willingness of EP@@ A to co @-@ operation with the States through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under former administr@@ ations the EP@@ A often did the deadlines for carrying out and then acc@@ used to be charged by acti@@ vi@@ st@@ Groups and others , and in an agreement struck the appointment for performing , &quot; said Pru@@ itt said the EP@@ A more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by jurisdi@@ ctions , and we take time seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority , which we are there , Ernst . &quot;
&quot; however , the opinion of the EP@@ A that Pru@@ dential up at some point &quot; authority &quot; will be used at some time , to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a fully @-@ reaching real@@ ms of the oz@@ on@@ ation .
one in the last month of Author@@ ized Legal Not@@ ice is supposed to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years .
the measure was not yet made to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General State @-@ state Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who was charged the coalition of the states who had been charged the EP@@ A in this week , said the group intended to maintain the legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EP@@ A - according to our conditions - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yor@@ kers and that over 115 million Americans , which are directly affected by the smo@@ g , which flows into their communities , said S@@ lic@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil Oz@@ on arises when contamin@@ ants from cars , power stations , oil ingen@@ berg , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere are responding to sunlight . &quot;
the de@@ standing smo@@ g can cause sensitive groups of people serious respir@@ atory problems and contribute to thousands of premature death .
representatives of the public health sector and the environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over Pru@@ section surprising course of course .
&quot; it is disturb@@ ing how much pressure it needs to get this reasonable step by the responsible for the protection of air that we invite to breathe , &quot; said L@@ ori Ann Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Diversity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ide@@ ological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tru@@ mp government to p@@ amper themselves in environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celeb@@ rates 750 years St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Church
&quot; 750 years St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche is invited to the old cemetery area of Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , 16 . July to 16 : 30 at a Ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

the visitors of the Six@@ th Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z @-@ Ser@@ en@@ ade can be ench@@ anted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers of tum@@ or to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stressed : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ori@@ ental petty od@@ ine . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel was first mentioned at the Wu@@ tem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ guide@@ book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold to the mountain with the view of the parish church by Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and to his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver .
&quot; the wor@@ sen@@ ing of the document according to the Tum@@ linger mountain has also been a magnificent courtyard , one of the church or the pat@@ ron@@ aut , and not the other way around . &quot;
so there are people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; &quot; Berg &quot; &quot; of the third , the dominant settlement of the village . &quot;

the go@@ ddess of pat@@ ron@@ age was originated from the early medieval owner @-@ law .
&quot; a gent@@ leman , who built a church , un@@ covered and occupied with a priest , remains owner of this church and could also destroy these characteristics . &quot;

&quot; the newly created glob@@ es then appeared for the first time in 1692 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 1648 ) the windows were st@@ olen and the bells were st@@ olen .
the roof was un@@ dense .

&quot; by 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius was also served as the last retirement for the dead of hearing . &quot;
1823 was enlarged the cemetery and broke the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche .
only the ch@@ urch@@ yard can be left .
in the New Spring@@ sn@@ eight 1834 sp@@ alt@@ ete a storm the church tower and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent the un@@ happiness , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only today still existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .

Association wants to examine approval of bicycles
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned into the countryside . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; has been called Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw his permission for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is un@@ law@@ ful .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines should have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only existed at the city border to Schwal@@ m@@ tal . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time causes the concentration zone , but an exclusion of wind use for the rest of the town . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had reached a second wind turbines , a second wind turbines zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - who had not approved the District regime in Düsseldorf because of a form@@ ul@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of plan@@ ation @-@ legal requirement is the authorization author@@ it@@ ably remains un@@ law@@ ful and therefore also to increase , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; . &quot;
current state of affairs : the city council held once again the windsurfing center in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit of the District government stands still out .
&quot; in this point , this is the creation of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of a solic@@ itation .
&quot; the appropriate writing has entered the circle since last week , explained a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to the occasion to consider the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not lead to it that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle was not intended to express in content on Thursday to the ar@@ gum@@ entation of the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , an Sub@@ si@@ diary of NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four the 200 meters high wind@@ wheels . &quot;
&quot; already in the past year , the company had participated in which the city of Vier@@ sen takes part in the eight@@ y agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares sized . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement is to be covered by approximately 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately a fifth of the power consumption of all four households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer gave four quarters , green light stood for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as an involvement in a wind turbines in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Circle Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cr@@ ying together : woman dies in an aw@@ ful accident
one terrible traffic waste started on the Friday morning at 10 am on the L 333 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and B@@ itt@@ al ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn district ) .
a woman was wo@@ unded by it .
two other persons were easily in@@ ju@@ red .
the national road remained locked over hours .
&quot; according to Poli@@ cies , a 17 @-@ year young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with their cars in the frame of the accompanied drive with her 53 @-@ year mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of B@@ itt@@ arius . &quot;
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to discover new shops in the city center in September .
the commercial club and the Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities want to use the weekend on 8th and 9th September to attract the residents to reach the shopping centre in the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the trade association , Christian King , announced the &quot; home @-@ sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend , the &quot; homeland @-@ sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; was supposed to sensi@@ tise the customers the own city away from the usual supermarket product . &quot;
&quot; planned is therefore a market with regional vendors , similar to the weekend &apos;s market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the local companies are supposed to present themselves with their educational plans . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center to the &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; was supposed to invite you . &quot;
the promotion is not only in inhabitants of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in radio , an Internet video and printed sach@@ et , refer to the Ak@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
Municip@@ al Auth@@ orities and Commercial Society Collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
this makes the commercial club and the city into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv @-@ Day &quot; &quot; as well as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , conversations with all commercial use and hosts in order to actively participate in active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential are new or restored . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center in shopping out of sight .
&quot; in the end , all will need to contribute to the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories around the city and Ver@@ an . &quot;
&quot; to overcome it , with a network the Le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy to overcome the partly , had said king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , leader of the I@@ HK Centers in Mühl@@ hausen shared with that the nationwide third &quot; home country sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; Day , for the first time five Thür@@ inger cities participate . &quot;
&quot; besides Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day was well informed of the appreciation of local trade and its significance for the common good of our cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the management of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can be influenced by his buying @-@ behavior environment itself .

Tru@@ mp sat down the tran@@ scription of phone call in Mexico under pressure due to payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription by phone calls between US @-@ President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp on a phon@@ at with the Mexican President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to listen to publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President im@@ pris@@ oned him because he had publicly proclaimed the Wall . according to him , he said to him , &quot; &quot; this can not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched its presidential campaign with the promise to build up a wall to the southern border of the USA , and schw@@ or , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first calls with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ au were also published and un@@ veil@@ ed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp said Mr. Turn@@ au , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; , &quot; &quot; m@@ ies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stup@@ id &quot; , &quot; said him as a &quot; &quot; land@@ p &quot; , &quot; after he was introduced to ban the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call , having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that is the uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford @-@ Mass@@ aker : acti@@ vi@@ sts perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; an 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury was driving through a group of spect@@ ators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and ru@@ m@@ bled to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver was able to reach the bridge entered a group of white men with tissue , in order to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the Mob@@ bing - a male middle age in a needle @-@ suit - took a long train at its c@@ ig@@ ar and bli@@ cked inspec@@ ting through the wind@@ shield .
inside flo@@ ats the passengers in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; brood the man . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
sh@@ outing of the silence was distor@@ ted as a young black man from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , only a post @-@ presentation . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck by &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them in the audience is very real Se@@ u@@ f@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Citiz@@ enship to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge back to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one was indi@@ cted because of the mor@@ de .
&quot; it truly is un@@ certain that in all these years there was no single person arrested - although we know them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks , who helps in organising the post @-@ creation . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old congress of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the post @-@ creation as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that there was never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want pro@@ secution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a court medi@@ ate lays a bed cloth on the corp@@ ses of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore Ford Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI Ak@@ ten , which were received by the N@@ BC News , were more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding county seat in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none was ever indi@@ cted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been on the open foot since decades , civil rights , that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch @-@ actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 he made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice to the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , in the pre @-@ blo@@ ating fight in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as choosing st@@ ach according to the details of the F@@ BI , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owners , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while a battle is down - sup@@ pose@@ dly because of a woman . &quot;
Bro@@ oks said to have the sm@@ ells in the city was that H@@ ester was slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried out by her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from the prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they were distant from the prison and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approaches , embr@@ aced a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison that the mor@@ de was prepared and arranged , it closes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also evident that there was a complete election between state and local pro@@ secution , which was not only involved in the murder , evidence has been safegu@@ ar@@ ded and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks formulated it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a elect@@ oral mass@@ ac@@ re , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
almost a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ andra has headed the annual delivery of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their portr@@ ay@@ al is vivid , stri@@ pping and is based in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , from which many believe he no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to look , and even more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that the point is . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we then become confronted with his hon@@ ours in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me , or do not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white , and the rest of black - into a space and lou@@ der , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ gra@@ gh is here Gre@@ ens Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ry member since years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel shy , because I am not so &quot; , &quot; said Mar@@ gra@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to preserve this story in life , because we would not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room tried the actor D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , the Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester angel@@ es and afflic@@ ted him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , w@@ oke of my property ! &quot;
razor is wi@@ ped the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ s at the lau@@ gh .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ ar@@ ated and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; he said Gre@@ ene , still k@@ ich@@ ern@@ d . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- er &apos; have said . &quot;
&quot; but , we@@ ather@@ ed one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and it is exactly that shi@@ fts the energy in the space , a sense of compan@@ ionship re@@ places the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ Word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laugh@@ s .
this re@@ petition ends violent and fast .
there are excav@@ ations , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , with a grap@@ e @-@ dress , stands out above the corp@@ ses of the actor and leads to Bil@@ lie Holidays , &quot; Str@@ ange Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks out with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it wis@@ er a group of about four dozen people swe@@ at and te@@ ars out of the eyes .
the audience is divided almost as black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , enriched to see the performance , many come just down the street . &quot;
they all experienced almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppressed moisture when Bro@@ oks put her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mor@@ de has remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , feel the air spreads . &quot;
&quot; to sound the final notes of the song , Gre@@ ene loads a lot closer to come and to insp@@ ect the body name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ok@@ ing on their heads , register the counter@@ f@@ eit blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ dering a little boy , as if he remember this . &quot;
after a few minutes he would like to thank Gre@@ ene the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors take the Lyn@@ t@@ eil weg and w@@ aven@@ ly their te@@ ars .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ gra@@ gh , the man in the suit , which has played the cl@@ ans . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow players and breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance breaks down with it . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ per one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this out of one reason . &quot;
later the audience starts with the actors for dinner together .
at a table pl@@ au@@ ded a white pair from Atlanta stim@@ ulated about the post @-@ creation with a black pair that they have just met .
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski therefore fought words to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from folks who look like you themselves and what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me , lets me believe that the Lyn@@ n still goes on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police are called p@@ hili@@ stine . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ r@@ one Bro@@ oks Hof at his table , he is@@ st and remember the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post @-@ creation is inspiring in a certain way , because she describes the hor@@ rors of what we have proved , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we have nothing to learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
whoever does not study his own history who does not know his own history is condem@@ ned to repeat them .
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ ner@@ i@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ um@@ ental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf continues to be a colour@@ ful @-@ fri@@ vo@@ le st@@ aging before gigantic , six @-@ sto@@ rey back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the rot@@ ter ( designed by Alek@@ san@@ dar Den@@ ic ) shows either an ash@@ amed street with a wall and d@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; &quot; logo from G@@ DR @-@ Time or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , it par@@ ked an open Mercedes @-@ car , in which the Rhein@@ ka as Rock@@ erg@@ y@@ ls posi@@ eren , or alternatively a is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ ff@@ ed oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three en@@ co@@ res - sang of Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren like already in &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;

brut@@ al the scene as he vict@@ orious .
later this must also be Gun@@ ther ( Markus Oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Con@@ du@@ ctor Jan@@ owski , who bend the hands and hands on the Merkel du@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; big appl@@ ause is available for the game @-@ string , which shows itself for the first time on stage - given the big heat again in le@@ ased leisure time . &quot;
with tension expected the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ar pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later major Ju@@ bel in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ zz &quot; &quot; went . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; you realize that the audience grew up with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , it had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown a understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive re@@ ü@@ me@@ e .

they work in their volunteers at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the Mö@@ d@@ sburg , once a week , I stood here in gre@@ ven at the Mö@@ ll@@ bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked on the open air day at school .
how are your experience with it ?
&quot; it is a nice , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with juven@@ iles , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; you are now 26 years , therefore a late volunteer . &quot;
how does this happen ?
quantity : I made dig@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering studies , we say to be successful away . &quot;
I have recognized for me that it is for me and I want to do something else with people .
and then I asked me what do you do .
&quot; Ma@@ ch a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe too , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social life in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social @-@ worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not something unusual during volunteer services to have several different applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
always it happens to where to make his F@@ SJ .
one can make it from aging to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me this was just the right what has been heated .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different from the engineering studies ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
you still have other people pre@@ m head to have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refuge@@ e , whether a teen@@ ager has been out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any kind of touch ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , lots of kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so it is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son short@@ ens further 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the divi@@ dend to re@@ produce business . &quot;

correspon@@ dents said that the su@@ m@@ ord@@ att@@ ate in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused their policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af G@@ han@@ i .
EP@@ A returns to the delay of the Smo@@ g rule by k@@ ick@@ ness
&quot; the US American environmental protection authority has made a decision to regul@@ ate a regulation of the Government of Obama who are oblig@@ ated , w@@ on@@ ach the states are oblig@@ ated to sil@@ enced the Smo@@ g @-@ caus@@ ative emissions . this took a day after 15 states used the agency because of the ste@@ pper . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; o@@ zone @-@ regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the commitment of the agency to work with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and on it that we react on our state partners , &quot; said EP@@ A @-@ Chief Scott Pru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; pru@@ dence had announced in June the intention of the EP@@ A , which should be measured in a part of the country of poll@@ ut@@ ant emissions , to define where in@@ cis@@ ions must be made to delay more str@@ ingent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 most largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , rei@@ ded on Tuesday kick and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to reg@@ ain a wide range of environmental regulations , which has risen to the former president Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda , which is to boost Tru@@ mp &apos;s economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the back of the democr@@ ats and reserves , concerns about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EP@@ A website says that the inhal@@ ing of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and can reinforce the breath@@ able sy@@ mptom , such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clearly stated : with two oppos@@ ites the verdi@@ ct of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ z@@ eln decides to establish a common space in the future seniors . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing piece section is signed , reported Mayor Bernhard Tj@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take up until the so far of the church community belonging to the municipal council , there is now no flat@@ rate for that of a private investor to static project more . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion regarding a common period . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered the municipality to meet . &quot;
on the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters surface for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council imp@@ ending , such a common space will not only be seen as the meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ s@@ fair dwelling , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example made the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; round . &quot;
&quot; the decision is decided by delivering funds for the current budget already decided last autumn , through funding possibilities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common period would be , so about Tj@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision can be sign@@ aled to sign@@ alize the investor that one wants him in this respect no bill@@ ets between the legs , the finding that both saddle - which is reduced to the ambient temperature - which makes wearing height and the construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not just Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer , be this addi@@ tive . &quot;
if &apos; s helps : un@@ anim@@ ously he happens the body .
not so easy it goes to the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not come so right for this . there is now at the common room of the window , she says : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Yv@@ onne Sta@@ iger is absolutely agre@@ es to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it is a covered sub@@ stan@@ tive of anyway or foreign investors .
&quot; that is not that , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but also get a real , in the two @-@ shift fall , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
Sta@@ ig@@ ers application to send the qu@@ int@@ ages accordingly , three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two oppos@@ ites in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller so summar@@ izes : &quot; &quot; if we put the decision to close it , we make a giant step in our infrastructure . &quot;

in the Harz Mountains on star
&quot; in the Harz Mountains , the nationwide first &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; is planned . &quot;
this is planning the association observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a Planet@@ en@@ weg exists in Göt@@ tingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; come to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ a visit , it was called . &quot;
&quot; it connects nature , science , movement and spor@@ ty performance . &quot;
the members want to keep track along the planned route and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase of 2018 , the club plans to reach well @-@ able installations in five to six places . &quot;
&quot; question cheese from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Ho@@ h@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be supplem@@ ented by internet .
that is why a good mobile network is playing a good mobile network .
also barrier @-@ free is a crit@@ er@@ ion .
later the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad train is supposed to be extended by train .
&quot; on the Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad learn the viewer &apos;s much information , for example about the physics of the individual stars &quot; , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they taught why stars could have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , even though he significantly exce@@ eded . &quot;
also im@@ part@@ ed in which constell@@ ation can find a selected star and when he is best to see .
the association has already operates since 2014 at the Berg@@ städ@@ ter St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest located observ@@ atory of Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the national park resin counts according to the Federal Ministry of Nature Conservation to the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible .
since 2003 the University of the Förder@@ verein planet@@ arium Göt@@ tingen has been a unique simil@@ arity like the planned ast@@ er@@ ism - the Planet@@ en@@ weg since 2003 .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planet@@ en@@ weg ends up to the Hain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ ze ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the ri@@ mp@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ scheduled Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6,@@ 5 millimeters , while the sun is about 70 meters away from the sun at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ eters . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; during the light of sun up to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestrian are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fix@@ ings but would last a half year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia which should stand in a coll@@ is@@ ion@@ ic course to ins@@ ulated the most thr@@ illing Box@@ ing campaign in the near future under 147 pounds and met for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ trained World Box@@ ing Council , the cor@@ ridor down , to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ ather champion . &quot;
according to Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through un@@ anim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday on show@@ time are both fighters members of top @-@ five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How is it to you , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Satur@@ days evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple presented for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters that would be the perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to run on lightweight .
and he must move to Light@@ weight@@ ed &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
we demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to vote .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; he asked if it should be on pay @-@ by @-@ view , part of a strategy , the Lom@@ ach@@ enko has to be in this year to arrange a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also are interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View Mode , because all fans asked to him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and oppressed themselves later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he said Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; an enormous figh@@ ter , &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday struggle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko did with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the triangle Champion out of River@@ side is very slow , sorry I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you just kick off the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the cap@@ tivity that came for their own battle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which must be carried out . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work to work , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I wa@@ ited to the top comb@@ at@@ ants and that is Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four final after ty@@ re
during an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon four people were difficult to hurt .
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was shortly before the junction market , pres@@ um@@ ably after a ty@@ re space he pres@@ um@@ ably take control over his vehicle . &quot;
the passenger climb@@ s to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he survived and then lying on the roof of the stripes .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were also difficult to hurt the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last through the lif@@ ebo@@ at service , the A7 was locked in direction north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left side stri@@ pe to the accident . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; rotating Chain Works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann ho@@ ver after 2 : 2 to the season clo@@ aking against Braunschweig that brings the optimization of the def@@ ences in au@@ e points .
&quot; with the first racing game , Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result also , would not have been the two oppos@@ ing at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ences of Fortuna Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Ore Mountains , the rotating chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
and a gate after a c@@ ash the For@@ tun@@ es want to no longer be influenced .
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ensing ) will be on line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better getting better after the experience in preparation with the rotating chain , than with the four . &quot;
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach of Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann as we are in the rotating chain on the semi @-@ positions at KA@@ AN Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Cast@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ condition is , but that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t afford to make as many dig@@ nit@@ ude . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether one cannot speak after a un@@ decided by a mis@@ sl@@ ate start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the Pok@@ al , we will certainly be able to speak out of a new season . &quot;
thereof his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season , I only did after six to eight players , &quot; Fried@@ helmet Funk@@ el , who does not want to talk from an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e perhaps could be some fr@@ ame@@ ful , since they would have no he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fortuna against a as@@ cen@@ sus in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 @-@ process where they are currently standing , &quot; says the interior of the Fortuna . &quot;
&quot; while the guests are going out of the Rhineland as a lighter favorite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we leave them away , just because we have the claim to come among the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ sense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , its balance in just a defeat against Au@@ e out of nine games quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which one has to hit by front in front , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Che@@ f@@ coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement to meet would be arro@@ gan@@ t and adul@@ tery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el wants to experience its players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for For@@ ensi@@ c medicine ( Rät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started carrying out the tests last year .
&quot; they are supposed to be more exact during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish mig@@ r@@ ation authority ( Mig@@ r@@ ations approved ) because of errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; up to date , Mig@@ r@@ ens announces 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2.@@ 48@@ 1 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eight@@ y percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency assumed that the person may possibly be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is under 18 years old .
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is ques@@ tioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency , the results are consistently resistant in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have suffered over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that the under@@ search@@ ed person will be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; seen as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det the 581 published results , she asked that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ rays of Weis@@ sen@@ zä@@ hnen and MR@@ T @-@ recordings of knee joints are analyzed , then critic@@ ised by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ ep@@ tic is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work encomp@@ asses the evaluation of the biological maturity of people to see if they had sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I have reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very in@@ secure .
&quot; if we can not safely say it , we should not do as if we could it , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ ensi@@ c Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; generally you may say that the risk to assess a child as an adult , is low . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk lies in it if the person is less than 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are going well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven tons of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , buil@@ ders in the department of street and traffic in the Govern@@ si@@ di@@ dium Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April the work began at all three san@@ itation , bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
building is planned for October and is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , by Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge from concrete , who is d@@ ressed with rot@@ em Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein , and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it is now in the years . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly cleaned . &quot;
the two other bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built in red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the mid@@ day morning at the north side a lot of meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called br@@ ush@@ cap .
&quot; this is a Rand@@ y , which is also used as operating path . &quot;
the southern part of the bridge is intended to be used on Friday a 54 metres wide range of glasses .
on it the way is to run away .
&quot; this is the particular thing that it is finished , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented socket .
special finger@@ ing@@ feeling has created the power of lines through the construction works in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; for there , a glass @-@ fibre is also connected to which many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ set up of the project .
&quot; in addition , they had to be det@@ ained fish and cra@@ y@@ fish . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the construction of buildings and the gathering in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic in direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher County is the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; T@@ ann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cost of three Br@@ ück@@ els is up to 700 000 Euro .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest on German pot@@ ato sal@@ at
&quot; it does not come so often that parties are moving to a string , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ E ) , what else is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD ) parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peaceful flag because the Af@@ D at the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle Ron@@ dell for the noisy &quot; great elect@@ oral d@@ der &quot; invite . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice femin@@ ism , which is formed together with Alexander Gau@@ land the peak election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already hours before the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ Ds , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains multic@@ ol@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; originally the city was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore right in front of the sight of those who arrive at the Af@@ E @-@ Event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers you .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizer , rightly pleased : &quot; great how many people came here together . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; Urugu@@ ay@@ pot@@ ato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has passed many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the train station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ E got on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes declared by the Af@@ D Vul@@ can@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to ensure such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a forecast because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ by no enough parking places available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says , &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 p.m. on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle diverse speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ pf@@ z@@ ian Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall approximately 200 list@@ eners that wait for the sh@@ utter @-@ di@@ d@@ atin for the bun@@ dest@@ al code , Alice past@@ el , and vice @-@ president of the chairman of the Beatri@@ x of Stor@@ ch were holding their speeches . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; slightly more than an hour take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 hours . &quot;
the police can be back - no special mention .

&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov , he meets a concert under the motto &quot; &quot; Black Sea , &quot; &quot; or even &quot; &quot; stran@@ gers &quot; &quot; hits a classical German education with roots in the bladder music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have Sol@@ op@@ osi@@ tions in the European nickname .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ ed at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the l@@ ust , not only the borders on their instruments but also mer@@ ging the borders of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; that sounds Johann Sebastian Bach and the two as in a new format , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; &quot; combines themselves with Bulgarian @-@ folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed N@@ ils W@@ og@@ ram , mix classical , jazz and the free play to an intri@@ gu@@ ing overall kunst@@ werk . &quot;
this core piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .

Kri@@ sten Stew@@ art talks about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love gr@@ illed cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , so cri@@ st@@ ew@@ ards art very openly about their Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I sat down in gr@@ illed cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes as &quot; &quot; neighbour &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of the Holl@@ y@@ den stars was the one of her &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately was bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite this in@@ sured the Brün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; magazine &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; I was in everyone seriously fallen , whom I fil@@ med . &quot;
&quot; or believe it , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation there were critics , that she was bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ell : &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed . &quot;
so it has never been be@@ wil@@ dered or disabled .
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; in particular , they suffered according to &quot; Bang Show@@ biz &quot; but in school time , when they rather like a rep@@ ent@@ ance : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been in@@ ju@@ red .
&quot; when I got eleven I had my children , I would look like a rep@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I felt really attacked , fright@@ ened and ash@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially to the public they don &apos;t like to live their love : &quot; people expect you in a certain way and anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and perhaps they call me some than und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justi@@ fy me before the whole public . &quot;
govern@@ or of West Virginia announces that he has changed the party
&quot; the democratic Govern@@ or of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday night at a demonstration with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have away from me , &quot; said Govern@@ or Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with lots of prayer and a lot of things ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic Govern@@ or . &quot;
the r@@ ally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp sp@@ ake before a major announcement at the West Virginia r@@ ally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice does not endor@@ se the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , according to For@@ bes of the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; For@@ bes thought that he possesses Ko@@ hl@@ em@@ inen in five states , and has inher@@ ited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1,@@ 59 billion dollars . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee was issued on Thursday morning , in which it said , &quot; &quot; the Party of Govern@@ or Justice is another blow to a democratic party which would work us rather than they would be able to make our land again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Govern@@ ments and the control of the least legal entity in history is the announcement of Govern@@ or Justice only the final rejection of a party which is , from above to below without leadership and is not able to find a positive , un@@ objec@@ tion@@ able message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chairman R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the CB@@ S News . &quot;
Co@@ e pra@@ ises &quot; honor@@ ary &quot; Russian exc@@ use for intelligence scan@@ dal
&quot; the worldwide head of Ath@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , pra@@ ised on Thursday , which he is described as an apparent exc@@ use from Russia to an doping scan@@ dal , but he re@@ peti@@ te , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded again in sports . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ el said during the I@@ A@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championship that the exile of his land was correct from the sport and that he decided to fight the intelligence .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , those in cont@@ ests gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the I@@ A@@ AF congress for the maintenance of the prohi@@ bitions came up in November 2015 , after a report of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) references to state intervention in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said I@@ A@@ AF @-@ President Co@@ e the re@@ por@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the whole council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognized itself , that she has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation will be re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia was the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corru@@ pted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , after the strict I@@ A@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the I@@ A@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia still satisfy some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and conce@@ aled trainers are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ ters in London after a lecture at the I@@ A@@ AF Council . &quot;

&quot; it describes the two conver@@ sions , but as a &quot; skill of their specialist . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we circum@@ cis@@ ed us from this highest victim , which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year major and the 47 @-@ year Stab@@ ili@@ t from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her sm@@ il@@ ders were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a Tot@@ ale @-@ guard of the Ar@@ med Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .

&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of the Reg@@ iment , said to the soldiers &quot; said , &quot; if this crew could not turn the crash , then it would have no ver@@ mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts about the UN @-@ Mission in Mali showed prime minister of Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance for a country , from which we are only separated by two states . &quot;
after the funeral party the S@@ är@@ ge was brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not have any information . &quot;
Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prin@@ z Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
the shared the Royal House on Thursday with .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish king@@ doms is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculpt@@ or Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard is already one of Sar@@ k@@ oph@@ ag for the two .
the queen did not agree with the decision of her husband and was it further in the communication .
where prince Hen@@ rik buried , is not yet un@@ clear . &quot;
but he does not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
prince Hen@@ rik had never made a he@@ ap of it that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
&quot; in 2016 he went to retirement , and also places the title &quot; &quot; prin@@ cess &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he do not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , declared L@@ ene Bal@@ eby , the chief @-@ speaking of the Danish kingdom house . &quot;
where the last retirement of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old eventually shall be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French hom@@ etown , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .

in the Th@@ ames he worked in the French emb@@ assy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ie@@ ties of the people always fle@@ w , had prince Hen@@ rik in his almost 50 years of reign with the Dan@@ es a heavy stand . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did , cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the reputation had to be the reputation , the brand of the ruling @-@ critical intellec@@ tu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ash@@ amed me .
these were just two faul@@ ts ! &quot;
Prime Minister W@@ eil wants swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green ruling majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , but he does not want to come back . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; because he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously the surprising r@@ arities of a Green MEPs made out of their agricultural day action in Lower Saxony the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the official date of the day @-@ day election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover represents their scar@@ ce majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green Euro MPs set up their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election 2018 in their election in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; declared it on Friday in Hanover . &quot;

&quot; with this CD@@ U and F@@ DP had together 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was conver@@ sely .
the new agricultural day will be elected by the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green national government has now decide whether they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , however , keeps it indispensable for the country that the country decides as quickly as his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U @-@ Group is expected to decide on Tuesday through its further action .
the local version also sees the opportunity to withdraw the confidence of the Prime Minister by the prime minister and sel@@ ects a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
these options have to be kept legally clean and said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler .
&quot; one is experienced in peace all questions , if they are legally reasonable . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something in ios .
the politicians themselves stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
it turned out to be a trailer in black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the de@@ grad@@ ation of de@@ pu@@ ties to the return of their country office .
&quot; we are of course assum@@ ing that they have received their country @-@ quality , which has given them back over the green country , with immediate effect , divided the President Met@@ a J@@ ans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ella . &quot;

&quot; also in front of the background that there was no content dis@@ agreements , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD &apos;s pul@@ pit Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the passage of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ s El@@ ke T@@ esti@@ bu@@ le to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Gre@@ ens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal in the laundry and laundry , but also betra@@ yal in red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Minister of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;

agricultural Com@@ ini@@ sts in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed for si@@ gh@@ ing eggs .
how could the scan@@ dal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Land@@ ent@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster Christian Schmidt ( C@@ SU ) is in an interview with the editorial network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt - How can the consumer protect against po@@ ison@@ ed eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumer to check the eggs in your refrigerator exactly and to check the stamp pressure .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ .de the states represent the state of the latest information on the affected egg @-@ batch .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now Al@@ di is taking over the best possible crisis of crisis - all eggs from the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the state of the state , is not really perceived ? &quot;
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has de@@ activated immediately and is since acquain@@ t@@ ance of Germany in close interaction with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just as much as the manufacturer carry on care , that the sold products sold @-@ capable and treat@@ able un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if in the case of the back@@ bed content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg exce@@ eded , these are not permanent . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time is not the operations to blame .
sit manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current knowledge , the production companies meets no immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on due to mut@@ ually illegal practices of service enterprises with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is in harvest@@ ing too little Controll@@ ers .
is it only lacking in the personnel or at the conclusi@@ ve jurisdiction ?
&quot; yet , it was just the official controls that have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth was also true that food was and criminal energy can never be passed on to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consequ@@ ent education of such operations and delivery to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases where criminal off@@ ences are in which criminal off@@ ences are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already clearly stated several times that I expect a complete explanation of the responsible authorities .
is the regular Al@@ ar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
&quot; consumer inside and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and sensitive foods . &quot;
&quot; if a non @-@ approved in@@ sec@@ ti@@ cide in food industry , consumer and consumers are rightly ou@@ trag@@ eous . &quot;
&quot; by the contamin@@ ated means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have been in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the in@@ sec@@ ti@@ ci@@ ds Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ based animals is unacceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
it has to be consistently worked on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all responsible agencies that the atomic facts is clear and in@@ complete .
how the financial regul@@ ate of the football on Ne@@ ym@@ ars moves to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to avoid un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European foot@@ soccer to prevent , become Ne@@ ym@@ ars Wel@@ tre@@ k@@ ord @-@ transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; there will be any consequences for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from UEF@@ A , as the leading organisation that the European game has super@@ vised the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by the UEF@@ A in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of Ne@@ uro is financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 Million $ ) to buy the Brazilian government from his contract , and Ne@@ uro will receive a sal@@ ary that will last several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars moves to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make security made up with security , so Ne@@ uro supp@@ ressed and bring him into a galax@@ y of other stars , considering the financing of the team by the energy of the weal@@ th@@ ine family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to raise a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but need to control with legitimate revenue streams , which allow them to use the Bre@@ ak @-@ E@@ ven point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini according to his election as the UEF@@ A @-@ Presi@@ dents in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that clubs who had enormous debt due to success in their quest , effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ ky to ruin , if banks or owners moved their support . &quot;
in 2011 FF@@ P shi@@ fted from concentration on debt to the monitoring of their losses .
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ amo@@ vi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential and then power@@ ed strong investment to build the team and build a global brand - become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ year period , who runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini had fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor of Alek@@ s@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to cry out of excessive expenditure . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out cl@@ ause from Ne@@ uro in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ ices via the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ uro has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the solution for the next five years can be arranged in the annual financial statements for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has met the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received an ATM of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros , and it was arranged for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 on 21 players instead of ordinary 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is searching for clubs which could try to list their financial confidence by associated their revenue by companies that are connected with the owners of a club .
&quot; while a cataly@@ st company could shor@@ ten the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market sets , the UEF@@ A would not apply this as the legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the P@@ SA was par@@ aly@@ sed by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments of Ne@@ uro payments on payments of the organisation Committee of the World Cup 2022 could come in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Kat@@ ar 2022 have fought that neo @-@ world amb@@ assador become , and such a maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regulations . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even attentive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
UEF@@ A had no pre @-@ prepared conversation with PS@@ G about Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , sag@@ ging the Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked under the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
&quot; the published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros , with a turnover of 54@@ 2,@@ 4 million . &quot;
the accounts for the final financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ ym@@ ars arrive a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dising and Tri@@ kot@@ sales . &quot;
the association is assum@@ ing that the turnover after signing at least 30 percent will rise .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and tried to avoid ne@@ ym@@ ars way@@ ade away by viol@@ ated that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial doping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La Liga , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ sen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a State who financed an association . &quot;

but more important is all@@ em@@ al of the advertising effects : for a tr@@ og@@ ging manufacturer it is a prestigious job .
&quot; how many applicants are in the new ten@@ ders , the Swiss will not betra@@ y . &quot;

&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like the time would be just below . &quot;

blow against drugs @-@ Maf@@ ia in the country
police is a blow against the Italian m@@ af@@ ia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on the Wedn@@ es@@ days in the Black @-@ B@@ aar region , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Con@@ stance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart many objects have been seeking , such as the Prosec@@ ut@@ or Con@@ stance on Friday evening . &quot;
15 def@@ ences were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 and have already been arrested .
&quot; in addition , the officials asked larger volumes of mari@@ juana and Kok@@ ain , Sch@@ uss@@ ani and several hundreds of hundreds of Euros . &quot;
at the same razor in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German adhesive .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action the Italian and Bay@@ erische investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Maf@@ ia is organised crime crimin@@ ality , severe violence , tried murder and pre@@ dat@@ ors and ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the pro@@ secution of Con@@ stance on organised drug trade in the South German area has been established . &quot;
&quot; between the Prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo , an stim@@ ulator exchange and investig@@ ators of the kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the wholesale company was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the sight of the investigation , the examinations took place from above all Italian nationality with reference to the Italian Maf@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; there was also an inci@@ dent on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , where early in the morning several shots into a restaurant was likely to go to the Ban@@ de account . &quot;
ensure large g@@ aps in fore@@ igners @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens that should not emerge , &quot; The fore@@ igner @-@ Register in Germany indicates significant defic@@ ien@@ cies . &quot;
the lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedure .
&quot; the representative for the refuge@@ e management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen means , has been attentive to a media report on big g@@ aps in fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; defects in the registered data could result in asylum procedure and deport@@ ations &quot; &quot; lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions , &quot; in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the register , there are ten million people with foreign citizenship , including about 5.5 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is managed according to some 600 ex@@ pe@@ al authorities in Germany .
because the data have not been sufficiently maintained by the data quality in parts have not been good .
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become the German citizen , and in the register actually no longer arise . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inputs can reduce back@@ processes considerably , it means the report to further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics about fiscal people , the EU citizens would not have to travel , which would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; however , such incorrect preparations led &quot; to a distor@@ ted debate on how to deal with qualifying , it is therefore still in analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government is obviously begun to send refuge@@ e families with under 16 @-@ year children back to Italy when they are submitted from there . &quot;
&quot; this deri@@ ves from an internal paper of the federal state for migration and refugees ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ backward newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is named after , the BA@@ MF leader such procedures &quot; &quot; regarding families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants , according to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper on reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Convention is responsible for refugees from the EU state , which they are first to achieve . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant is further forward to another EU country , this state can send him back into the country . &quot;
&quot; for the reason , the office is now : &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with min@@ ors children in Italy significantly increased . &quot;
Italy have released for the reception and accommodation of family warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) hold these ple@@ dges for sufficient .
other EU states would send refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the inter@@ pret@@ enti@@ onal speaker of the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threat@@ ens due to the lack of law in the Italian asylum system , and a haz@@ ard of the child &apos;s welfare . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after weak economic growth , and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulation about an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has war@@ ned that economic growth &quot; jobs , &quot; as they hold interest rates on family members in the midst of a strengthened pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates on 0.25 % , whereas in this month less members has an increase in rising , since the weak economic growth has wi@@ ped out the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in their quarterly assessment , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1,@@ 7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and war@@ ned that pressure on household income would probably continue to increase in almost 3 % . &quot;
but they sign@@ alized that in the next few years of adver@@ tise it would be necessary to breed inflation and she said that the l@@ ending costs may have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Con@@ jun@@ ets , which was issued before a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the funds plan to provide more cheap financial resources for banks , although said that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds of Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households continue to be charged the consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates re@@ peti@@ te them that &quot; &quot; a certain str@@ apping of monetary policy &quot; &quot; would be necessary for the cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently predi@@ cted the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradu@@ al &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.7 % and 1.9 % compared to the forecast predi@@ ct .
it has maintained its growth forecasts up to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages towards the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell to 0.@@ 4 % on half board .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appoint@@ ing growth , rising up the rising expectations on a customs clearance and GDP in the second quarter of 0.3 % increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be at 0,@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent inc@@ ub@@ ation Report offered little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an rising inflation and the slightly en@@ dur@@ ations , since the tight@@ ening is first worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you added that monetary policy can not be prevented in the next few years , but she added that wages for the end of its three @-@ year forecast . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened through the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound is attributed to a part of lower consumption . &quot;
&quot; the decision is made a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ ks of the sound caused . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; in front of the last judgment of the bank at interest rates , the call for a survey has risen , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ reduced households , with three political decision makers in July called a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is declined in the last month of 2,@@ 9 % in June to 2.9 % , although the bank said that this was expected and will again draw them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the bank said , the exce@@ ed@@ ance in proportion to its goal of 2 % is &quot; &quot; the weak pounds &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; given the shortest return of the S@@ wap , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , since the credit@@ ors are looking forward to shops and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market especially looks good for those in which the existing de@@ cks are exp@@ elled and the new mort@@ gage ex@@ clude , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should re@@ write the anti @-@ drug HIV @-@ drug 10,000 people . &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight before the High Court .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ risk proph@@ yl@@ ation ( pre@@ p ) which can reduce the inf@@ used risk for approximately 86 percent to now be delivered by health service on a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared to finance the process after the Ap@@ pe@@ al Tribunal in the past year has confirmed the verdi@@ ct of the Supreme Court of Justice , w@@ on@@ ach of the N@@ HS to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the first announced chess press was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; during the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bright@@ on , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are among the first which will allow registration of people , and further clinics are going to be introduced in October 2018 . &quot;
prevention ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicines that may be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission in inf@@ ectious diseases .
pre@@ p before intercourse to take that straight enough medication may be available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
&quot; those who come for treatment in question belong , we@@ ule or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable participants identified by the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner , whose HIV status will not be explained due to anti@@ retro@@ vir@@ al treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and are registered with a home office can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed up £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for supplying drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p , by which clinical specimen is collected , as it is implemented in large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV and over@@ take . &quot;
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it specifically focuses on needs and je@@ op@@ ed human beings , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidem@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; from September people , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie , that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine was vali@@ dated , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ in@@ infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ health care , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due to the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of spreading the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezzanine and cle@@ ver@@ e designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , distributed in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne was not packed and sold their pockets .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ ight@@ s@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I search@@ ed for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in them in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square kilometers has been fully out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; originally a single @-@ room estate with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne &apos;s storage space and one mezzanine , to use the generous head @-@ height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose she passed the Archit@@ ec@@ tural and Design Studio Duck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , the 12,@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not great enough to place two rooms over one another , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the en@@ core .
&quot; the Stahl@@ werk is rather complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ flowing with , without that we had to di@@ ce us . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but the steel so pun@@ ched that he had for the function above or down the correct height . &quot;
this arrangement makes it aston@@ ished to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine you can look down a classic clut@@ ch windows of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
&quot; sauce Gold@@ stone , Silver acc@@ ents and Vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; in both end , a short cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to make him longer work . &quot;
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are fed units place for all the cut@@ l@@ ery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can ex@@ clude the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the Fe@@ atured in this is that it is a guarant@@ or .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel intensi@@ fied , fur@@ lu@@ ed M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it if you push the door highly push , very easy g@@ athers . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate mak@@ ler will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time to use high quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not forget you into the electric power outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by good design and hei@@ ght@@ ened number of square met@@ ering in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate .
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the Dyn@@ asty , in a confrontation with one of the biggest real estate imper@@ ative Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business . &quot;
&quot; Paul did not want to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna poss@@ essed the brothers 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , accum@@ ulated since the family 1973 a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood , bought . &quot;
&quot; there , the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was inv@@ ests in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Matthew Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the subur@@ ban . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with their de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and domin@@ ating personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s family and Paul about one third . &quot;
&quot; a judicial representation that this means that col@@ in has been owned by 316 million dollars and Paul valued at 176 million dollars . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a concern for Paul and issues .
&quot; the distri@@ butions proposed by Col@@ in , have left him with what I held for the best objects , he wrote in 2015 in a first monkey @-@ dav@@ it . &quot;
on Friday the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on the last Friday .
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of col@@ in , such as Paul maintains him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not true , but cast Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions and compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ it , that was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to establish the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage is written that the family is the most important priority , he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cost rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ dav@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher partner and charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her hid her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the milk bars and delic@@ at@@ at@@ ess@@ en@@ ches made in the late 1950 @-@ he years and purchased a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood lip service in Col@@ in the first Je@@ ans@@ ing the family .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed their property g@@ ello to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted to land the brothers before judgment , &quot; &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis company group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark when leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark are , so Paul say about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very back , although he was a former AF@@ L level member , and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyer .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS , to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother has chosen Paul to complain and educate our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our Father had not been deliber@@ ately that Paul and I would like to end up in our current battle , he said and he added that he still hope to hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be past .
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tru@@ mp@@ s New Stab@@ ili@@ ef is planning to limit the media ab@@ stin@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and have failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ tico reported that the new administrative reef of the White House plans to restrict the information flow to President Tru@@ mp - including reports of the news media - in the hope to hold the boss at an equal course . &quot;
here is a piece of Re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; as John F. Kelly , the new Stab@@ ili@@ zation of the White House , held at his first working day with leading employees , he presented a main problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp@@ s white House , which he rep@@ lic@@ le : poor information that have put into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information about him should be flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings , because the President would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ aps Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media . &quot;
&quot; President Tru@@ mp@@ s relationship with television extends for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertisement is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candi@@ da@@ cy was anno@@ yed to un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince him , &quot; said the former elect@@ oral consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election officials in it , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a permanent lob@@ ster . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twitter is ever &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign witness@@ ed something that we do not know others - that Tru@@ mp@@ s Twe@@ ets would have to contain even more ig@@ nition .
we will probably never get something about the Twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; when his staff had sacrific@@ ed it some times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevent it consistently , that Tru@@ mp contro@@ vers@@ y calls out . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people together in a White House , which sets out of comp@@ eting parties , and again try to present their own agenda by bringing Tru@@ mp Material , which could possibly help their views from the world . &quot;
Pol@@ tico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants that sur@@ passed the President out of strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ maker :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp @-@ officials say that Tru@@ mp can react to negative press @-@ cuts , above all such with sh@@ ame@@ ful Lec@@ ks , and that he will figure out to find out about them . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone called the President mal@@ ign@@ ant a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Prov@@ ok@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , announced the source of Deputy Stab@@ ili@@ zer in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ aps to be in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently b@@ anned from Twitter , or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has expressed the wrong prec@@ urs@@ ory and rec@@ alled them in the past . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; he added that the dam@@ p @-@ reef Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ Secretary of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the pap@@ er@@ m and document the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a priest , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his consultants still seek influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make win@@ der mission very difficult .
master@@ ly re@@ cr@@ ush@@ ers receive post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the co @-@ operation of the population will pray and hopes . &quot;
the police in Europe is ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous discrimin@@ atory on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the search@@ ed s@@ heav@@ als are not known , are not known as evidence of the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most W@@ anted &quot; &quot; Adv@@ ent calendar from winter to follow . &quot;
&quot; the experiences have shown that many fle@@ es of holiday places were hi@@ red , it was meant by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
there are 21 post@@ cards for search@@ ed crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ um@@ ost@@ asis , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online search@@ ed could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications after the publication on the website . &quot;
travellers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ s @-@ Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house owners of West Mid@@ lands are back again with some dis@@ crete travelers on the war@@ fare of war@@ fare , which is one of the congregation to request a field in front of their manor houses . &quot;
the travelers have called their 20 caravans on a field outside a weal@@ thy street by Soli@@ h@@ ull which is called &quot; Milli@@ on@@ är@@ t series . &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were rejected only in May , however , by one of the council excav@@ ated dit@@ ch had been dism@@ issed to prevent their inci@@ dents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the def@@ enders and oppressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; fur@@ ious residents have afflic@@ ted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &quot; us@@ eless is to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said : &quot; &quot; they are on the assembly , after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they have thrown stones at the p@@ asser@@ s . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced to act by shame on the implementation in the act as it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
travellers were there in May they were moved and are back again .
&quot; more yesterday evening , probably still more . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham know how to deal with it by doing long sub@@ missions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy , continuing to pay my community to pay if the Council can not even stop . &quot;
&quot; a inhabitants who did not be called , said : &quot; &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just have seen the last round of this trav@@ eller , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the park area .
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so as to continue as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants can report a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling them 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court has to consider when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ s.com is currently being renovated and will be opening again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , due to the dam@@ aging ambi@@ ance operating company mbH to 13 April 2014 the time period lasts approximately 30 000 nights per year and also revenues through the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees who settled in the district , the hotel building of the finca together as a collection of accommodation , which was designated for contro@@ vers@@ y discussions . &quot;
the town prevented prevented accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the placement of a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was then not contro@@ versi@@ al at that time in the church .
but above all the Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ o@@ Ober@@ bür@@ germ@@ eister Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested parties in the house .
he should reserve right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad men@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are looking for Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the previous Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof already for a long time Bau@@ sch@@ utt@@ ons are already standing in front of the entrance , and when one enters the house , it becomes apparent , which will be made extensive renovation work . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils were cut out , blan@@ kets to part dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tubs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large be@@ atable showers , the input area will be re@@ designed , there will be new windows . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expressed . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a conference room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you do not move at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a ground@@ ed downtown level , st@@ resses black@@ erer . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its about 60 rooms set up wide and explained Sch@@ erer .
&quot; individual ho@@ liday@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led to the she@@ ers .
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
just below a million euros he expects .
&quot; also , the outside plants are placed on the front @-@ hand , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace which is open from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special Jury sets grand jury
in Russia &apos;s affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp is supposed to have a special message from Robert Mu@@ eller after a report a so called Grand Jury .
&quot; the Panel included the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; under appeal to the matter of familiar persons . &quot;
the newspaper explo@@ ded the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded its ground@@ ing and intensi@@ fied .
the sender CN@@ N reported that there is already the first pre@@ throat of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp@@ s äl@@ test@@ em son and a Russian lawyer .
us @-@ intelligence services to the Kre@@ m@@ lin has been targeted in the presidential term 2016 in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were deport@@ ations between Tru@@ mp@@ s voting team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand in the elect@@ oral campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to that , Mu@@ eller also report more and more Tru@@ mp@@ s private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special materi@@ alist Tru@@ mp has been lifted personally into the center and under@@ go the fore@@ front , whether the president in the course of the affair might hin@@ dered the judi@@ ciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider this evidence in possible accounts , and decide whether acc@@ us@@ ations should be raised . &quot;
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called acc@@ lim@@ ati@@ ans .
mostly they are switched on when it is bigger and contro@@ vers@@ y cases .
the process always occurs behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched from the prosec@@ ut@@ or &apos;s office to load persons to the hearing under E@@ id .
&quot; according to the sender CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations were exhibited , which turn around the encounter between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ R. and a Russian an@@ arch@@ ic . &quot;
persons who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement to be requested in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
beside Tru@@ mp J@@ R. were also Tru@@ mp@@ s consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared Kus@@ hner as well as his dam@@ al voting Paul Man@@ ze at the conversation .
&quot; right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ ties said on Thursday evening in the US television , that Mu@@ eller will not lay down in his work and that he should be , when it should be necessary , quick act . &quot;
&quot; however , there was no inev@@ it@@ ably hot that the Grand Jury will be switched on the end to decide about the collection of a prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the vibration of the Gre@@ mi@@ thing was the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President of the Thursday evening was given a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total in@@ vention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else about whom they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b commented in an opinion , he kno@@ wled@@ geable of the composition of a grand jury . &quot;
&quot; but these works also usually in secret , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the White House supports all actions that acceler@@ ated the work of the special way on &quot; fair &quot; manner acceler@@ ated .
the former F@@ BI @-@ Chief James Com@@ ey have said three times that will not be determined against the President .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that it has changed something , it was in the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was first used only after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had escap@@ ed .
&quot; because of this re@@ fr@@ y there were pre @-@ sp@@ ake against Tru@@ mp , he have to hin@@ der the judi@@ ciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said , Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp , asked him to address a attitude of investigation against the former national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under a great pressure because of the examination .
according to the portr@@ ay@@ al of US @-@ media the White House material against the Sonder@@ gen@@ ders and its employees .
the solved spec@@ ulation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent of the Congress , such as in the Water@@ gate affair around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has flow@@ ed a position in which it theore@@ tically will be fil@@ med by the President of the judicial Ministry . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to take such a step but proph@@ esi@@ ed .
&quot; two groups of re@@ publi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators asked on Thursday , after which the special ones could no longer be released as easy . &quot;
Ant@@ arc@@ tic : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in the Ant@@ arc@@ tic
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ arc@@ tic , a gigantic Eis@@ berg has solved itself from the period of nearly thirty @-@ hour size of Berlin . &quot;
the divided the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the over a Bil@@ lion tons of heavy and 58@@ 00 square kilometers big Kol@@ oss t@@ ri@@ be now to the north and will probably have two , three years , until he was mol@@ ded . &quot;
it has been registered with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the biggest ic@@ e@@ ants who have registered the re@@ searcher during the past three decades .
a danger for people is not going out of him .
&quot; in the extent of climate change , climate change has played a role in the dem@@ oli@@ tion of the ic@@ eberg , is still un@@ clear by research . &quot;
&quot; however , there has been a series of un@@ used break@@ down@@ s in the region for around 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a b@@ illing background . &quot;
in the opinion of many researchers this can be associated with the warming .
the pi@@ ste Kol@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s .
Schel@@ del@@ s flo@@ o@@ ded on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks off regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula .
north of this Shel@@ ter was the balance of wa@@ x@@ ing and break @-@ up in a few years ago .
a complete Schel@@ del@@ s be there , writing AW@@ I re@@ searcher by Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; I speak a lot that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Shel@@ f is in danger , because the front can@@ did have never returned so far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ic@@ eb@@ plate can be under voltage and ro@@ under , if there is a key place on a key place . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Schel@@ del@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they swim along the water and pushed the ice as much water as it appears after the mel@@ ting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the Shel@@ ving that the gl@@ aci@@ ers leads directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this might increase the sea level eventually , but only in the low size , writes the British research project to observe the Ant@@ arc@@ tic ( MI@@ DAS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s is after AW@@ I @-@ information with almost 50 000 square kilometres to the fourth of Shel@@ f of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic .
&quot; on the transfer from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is aware of a direct connection to climate change , the ic@@ eberg comes in a je@@ ep position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary by the British Sw@@ an@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the beginning of records , he confirmed it . &quot;
&quot; scientists be contro@@ versi@@ al whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Schel@@ del@@ s now come back and possibly mer@@ ged , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even though these researchers will not lead to the dem@@ oli@@ tion of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so many of the king@@ arc@@ tic of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula are destroyed in the past decades . &quot;
this long ph@@ ilosop@@ hies of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic covers the direction of South America .
according to the data of the British Ant@@ arc@@ tic Surv@@ ey is the ice of the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula since the 19@@ 50s at 28 000 square kilometres .
to the decrease did the temperature rose .
the Ant@@ arc@@ tic peninsula have passed over 50 years by around three degrees and thus for@@ gets to the areas where temperature at the fastest .
CD@@ U wishes Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it &apos;s more difficult to occupy blank places , demands the CD@@ U , from the worker association to be more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the K@@ rei@@ stag 41 new positions took place in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county management in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now once again 17 apprentic@@ es got their first day of work .
the lec@@ turers in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 620 applications were planned for the places in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing to be able to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are still 50 in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; they are looking for , among other things doctors and engineers , as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative in the K@@ rei@@ stag together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG .
administration should be elabor@@ ated after the wish of the parties &quot; a concept for personnel management and human resources . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short term demand for skilled workers , but future @-@ oriented of the applicants . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be based on the inside and outside to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; for the circle it has to do with staff problems , which you did not know before . &quot;
&quot; other cities promote good officials and employees , and offer attractive conditions . &quot;
the speech is given by a regular &quot; Competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this gives a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ alter@@ ing from the service to the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time to act so that not even more places stay un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter peoples , fac@@ tions of the CD@@ U , continues with his party over the joint request . &quot;
he said un@@ long since the day @-@ day for a fine @-@ thickness surprise when he presented the personnel @-@ back openly in question and the other parties was surprising .
peoples wants to be veri@@ fied that all possibilities will be veri@@ fied resulting from the municipal worker association .
&quot; if we come here not at short notice to a satisfying solution , the circulation of the unions should continue to work with the unions - perhaps also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ star@@ if &apos; , so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the CD@@ U , the employees and officials want to pay better than it is actually looking for the collective service to the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly pre @-@ written , Incre@@ ases or more money there is only if one changes in a higher level that is based on professional @-@ years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle has grown more and more over the past few years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which to deal with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ garten Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone of NGO @-@ migrants @-@ lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has NGOs , the lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , war@@ ned that they may not continue to continue when they do not stop new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; Minister Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Tur@@ ese daily La Stamp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had a boat of German assistance organization &apos;@@ Youth Ret@@ urns &apos; sei@@ zed , because their team had worked effectively with human traffic@@ kers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation that has only been in operation since a year , then it was to express the inci@@ dent of the Italian Prosec@@ ut@@ or Amb@@ ro@@ gio car@@ to@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us and remains the rescue of human life our highest priority . so we are sorry that we can operate at the moment not in the search and lif@@ ebo@@ ards area , &quot; &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all the acc@@ us@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had taken the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ urns &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that his crew infl@@ atable ding@@ h@@ y emig@@ rants on board , which can be delivered directly by human traffic@@ kers and that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can cycle that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such a coinci@@ dence , only 1,@@ 3 miles in front of the Liby@@ an coast took place , according to the Ak@@ te of the Prosec@@ ut@@ or , whose content of Italian media has been published . &quot;
&quot; the crew will susp@@ ect itself through the authority of the Italian coastal @-@ guard , the lif@@ ebo@@ ards within the zone of humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
under the code of conduct boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officers and monitored their activities .
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue points , have so far been declared to keep to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules as un@@ necessary , but acceptable , as they would not make any &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ actions . &quot;

&quot; Minn@@ iti said meanwhile , that the number of migrants who returned to the lif@@ ebo@@ ards in Italy , in recent weeks , was that the efforts to strengthen the Liby@@ an coastline and the cooperation with local may@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; over the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further discussions with Liby@@ an May@@ ors in this month over economic development initiatives , and with Cher@@ ad , N@@ iger and Mali over measures to reduce the number of migrants who can reach these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner Out@@ post &quot; and two drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz in order to enjoy four days Tri@@ als and landmarks . &quot;
there were three fac@@ ial guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ - and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome @-@ extra .
the first tour conducted with hot summer temperatures along the vineyards of Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the pa@@ w forest and the aforementioned levels could look . &quot;
in between @-@ between there have always been longer an@@ chor@@ ages for the long Tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , look@@ out for viewing point , connected by &quot; flo@@ o@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again many altitude metres .

&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 m , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from its best - spor@@ ty and cultur@@ ally - well @-@ known . &quot;
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga ge@@ ars up for e @-@ sport
sit the sports stars in future before computer con@@ sol@@ ete instead of fighting at wind and weather through the stadium ?
&quot; FA@@ KT is : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions fans and huge tournaments with high go@@ ings included . &quot;
this also recognized the first division of federal states that are increasingly active in this field .
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wol@@ fs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport department and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire your brand new young audi@@ ences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says the board of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ Germ@@ ann . &quot;
he is certain that on this train still rise in clubs .
&quot; the upcoming weekend will organise football World Association FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers of different clubs are organised . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wol@@ fs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven is qualified . &quot;
also Robin Dut@@ t sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now offering an agency for virtual soccer player .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ old , that young people still go into the stadium , &quot; says 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations , all sorts of markets , especially the Asian , to con@@ quer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be more far more likely to be present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ ess to Asia . &quot;
what is exactly about it ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League Of Legends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 &quot; , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or just the football @-@ simulation of FIFA on competitors . &quot;
&quot; long ago , like in normal sports also , Li@@ gen established , where the pros can play against each other . &quot;
and with the Asian @-@ sport e @-@ sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all a real sport ?
for many is the performance of certain acc@@ lim@@ atis@@ ation .
also Ingo F@@ rob@@ ail has long been considered with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ tho@@ ch@@ schule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport , because he is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and bodi@@ ly reactions that one can also find in classical sport - for example also increased heart rate , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , it need cog@@ nitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tic understanding and a fast response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be on the console , but also to exercise their body and pay attention to the nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ zy player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but also problems : &quot; &quot; doping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot;
&quot; controls be hard to run in online games , and in the scene f@@ aded the structures of classical sport . &quot;
positive confirms the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of the e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are internationally underway , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy on Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ ver@@ Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , we have been implemented around 50 million euros in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments . &quot;
sales of 130 million should be expected in three years .
against the almost 2.7 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed little .
&quot; however , the E @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; &quot; write the del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries around .
large markets are Asia and the US where Ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team NR@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood @-@ actor Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports race Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe is doing a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
in the Netherlands and in France the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations according to Dut@@ t is now committed to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board R@@ öt@@ t@@ Germ@@ ann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times clari@@ fied , is no longer enough today . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore going to preserve the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time al@@ ign on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ tised world , &quot; means Dut@@ t . &quot;
&quot; there you can not stick to it that only at football everything remains , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of texts that pushing Conrad Roy to su@@ ic@@ ide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years to two years because she encourages its friend through texts and calls to su@@ ic@@ ide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind Git@@ tern and five years have been exposed on the local currency . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condem@@ ned in June due to the per@@ me@@ ability of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said to Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ east . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter allowed up to stay free .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but their legal represent@@ ations , that both she and Mr Roy suffered in a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; in red tro@@ users and a cream colored bl@@ use , Carter stood with te@@ ars in the eyes , with fil@@ tered hands and down @-@ down eyes when she was condem@@ ned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have brought Conrad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ ut@@ at the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no re@@ sign@@ ation shown . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters advocate an attorney , it was an &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are totally regre@@ t@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that ye have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a prosec@@ ut@@ or read an explanation of Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who bes@@ otes that there is no day at which I do not sei@@ ze the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want that he is proud of me and how I go with everything I go . I try , despite all my pain@@ s , which we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters as it is in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ d@@ yn Roy , said that she will never be prosec@@ uted to the wedding of her brother or would never be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person who have been together with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain , whom I will keep in me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Boston , which makes it a crime to commit to others to commit su@@ ic@@ ide . &quot;
&quot; Carter was 17 years old , when Roy was found dead of a carbon det@@ ox@@ i@@ fication in a vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the case drew national attention to himself , after Car@@ ters text@@ books un@@ veil@@ ed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ g you on , springs from a building , er@@ ste@@ er yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many paths , &quot; she told in several news that she had sent them into the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; in the moments of his su@@ ic@@ ide they wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; everything you need to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention received by the death of Roy and ordin@@ ate that they will benefit by any press from the fall .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few , the Carter defended , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced to Italy because of murder at their British ro@@ ommate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserve compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ me to run at the Audi Cup as captain too , is no coinci@@ dence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tr@@ aut the Con@@ fed Cup winner has won a great season - Extra motivation .
&quot; something was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the additional gar@@ ment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp l@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself a shared thread at the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner behind , after his first use as a Bavaria captain . &quot;
good I could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the to@@ ken of the Coach could describe Kim@@ me as well .
&quot; not the eight years older Art@@ uro Vi@@ dal was in the youth @-@ play@@ ers , Deb@@ üt@@ ers , and just were chosen from the holiday an@@ ew existing C @-@ El@@ f as a tour guide . &quot;
&quot; sugars are distributed in the most loved ones , which you want to do much , which you want to keep in La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was au@@ dition , the heritage of l@@ ah@@ m can be done , a little extra @-@ motivation can only be well used . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; this is what you want as a player wants to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ itz@@ te of 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ l@@ ah@@ m over the field .
&quot; right behind , that is now its position , the white pearl on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me in this start @-@ formation as the one that can take the Ru@@ der also best in the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the dis@@ astro@@ us tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view to the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; with this , Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches so , to establish a dev@@ out of the services of Asia @-@ travel , and by Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , not negative to fall in their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot;
it all pop@@ ulated very well .
&quot; sweet went next to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the f@@ le , both ag@@ ated sovereig@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ing , Nap@@ oli @-@ storm did often difficult , and also tried addi@@ tive in the game building a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy went to that the result &quot; &quot; was not the same as we did that . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance while Deb@@ ü@@ t .
&quot; shi@@ fting , Tem@@ po@@ change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as in this Bavaria , this Bavaria is still for new additions , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for instance was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me passed into a few cris@@ p statements on the back of his new players .
&quot; there he heard of sweet an interesting phr@@ ase : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you just need to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not bring the New Age into the New Testament . &quot;

company satisfied with rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ care ministers : economy lo@@ zes Wis@@ s@@ ings Tempo
&quot; it often proved to be irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor Economic Department in the Rhineland @-@ Palatinate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new economic sm@@ ini@@ ster Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ aming at the same time the old mini@@ stries .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of tri@@ bal companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing &quot; &quot; access@@ es the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all@@ es@@ amt has blocked . &quot;
the largest K@@ ehr@@ ing@@ de sees Nat@@ us in the Infra@@ structure policy : the bridge circuit of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is in the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ es@@ list of the country now on the top .
&quot; in this year , the Ministry is hoping to stand on a plan method , up to 2021 the building is right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal government plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says Minister Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but international comp@@ eting companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , stri@@ ves to increase like Wis@@ sing , while wine a Rhineland @-@ Palatinate label to boost the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to create their own firm , lo@@ wer@@ ed the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cr@@ afts can be an additional incentive for young train@@ ees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; it is intended to make a premium rate of 1,000 Euro for the be@@ ating master@@ card and 2500 euros , if graduates within ten years after the master@@ classes are self @-@ employed . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country stays long .
&quot; in the planned road construction , they are quick facts to create , at the same time it was the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leaders of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers who wants to set the Wis@@ sing at the Mobility of Mobility , so far 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the I@@ HK is requested to for@@ give more orders to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ ts@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ are refers to calculations of the invoice , the land of investment in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of inland water@@ ways than suggested . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the sc@@ iss@@ ant angel in the region .
harvest@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 regional enterprises had been rated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the note .
they are compl@@ aining about thousands of Internet connections and break@@ down@@ s .
the ex @-@ economic Department in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the super@@ visory board of the wind force Pro wind .

&quot; Audi is supposed to modify 8@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face itself confronted with a return action . &quot;
&quot; a day prior to the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer , the software in more than 350,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said , the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; intelligent options as a constra@@ int , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or restrict . &quot;
Daim@@ ler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the observ@@ ance of rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nitrogen ox@@ ides , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , plants for the neutr@@ alization of diesel @-@ vehicles to install the g@@ ases , also take what it makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
the German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also indi@@ cted to have the powerful automobile companies and ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen to avoid the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices , regul@@ ate emissions when a car was tested , but when a car has been tested , but on normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indi@@ cted by Volkswagen , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former director of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni Pam@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be put in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigation into German crimin@@ als after the authorities to have installed a system to handle the emission rules in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen heavy loads : the luxury automobile manufacturers will be proportional to the gain of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the published Car@@ to@@ on @-@ Dra@@ ner , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ ini@@ er still shows and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed among other things as a drawing of luck @-@ up cards - what was frustr@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when in my job he lost , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60@@ th years of breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo took many fans .
and again the artists of cities are inspired .
&quot; large , un@@ dish mor@@ di@@ llo figures tum@@ ble in drawings with the sl@@ um tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting on the character , but works every day almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; via calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ü@@ n and watches will continue to find its dro@@ ll figures still much spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
&quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gir@@ affe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand feet as a return player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , coming to the kin@@ ship wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather sets up on the TV series , which is produced as its original design@@ ations . &quot;
lav@@ ender from the Provence is threatened from climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened from climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is re@@ minded of the conditions and due to the loss of d@@ rought , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great he@@ ada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agr@@ arian Institute CRI@@ EP@@ P@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively endangered , because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which was much less rain in the spring and in the autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ c@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lav@@ ender oil , not only for ho@@ liday@@ makers , it is also very asked for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of very long plant straps with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , UN@@ TER@@ ENT@@ W@@ IC@@ K@@ EL@@ TE and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with e@@ ther@@ ic oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution , and the slow@@ ing of the ev@@ asion from the ground , but also the test of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the ass@@ ass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corru@@ pt officials and irre@@ voc@@ al drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what you feel safer : you are supposed to take their children with the office , the 2009 aim of an attack with gran@@ ulates , or to leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have three words on a black@@ board on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porter , names for each column - no proof is necessary , perc@@ eptions and abs . &quot;
&quot; there are drug associations , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are betra@@ yed to the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no call@@ out of violence , and throughout the country the corp@@ ses , are more and more journalists at least 25 , since then President En@@ ri@@ que P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 took up his office . 589 are after attacks and threats under states and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is their publishers and their inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence will be deeply felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; on the façade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ por@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , and Miriam Ram@@ i@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts that show its smiling face with spectac@@ les or its typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ por@@ ters discuss its shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mare , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 has been a Son@@ der Bundes@@ anwal@@ de was er@@ ected to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two sent@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder , connected every year with drug dealers and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed before the court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still consist of treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are invisible , and although the terrain is still obli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ derer , without justice , the meeting in discussion of security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stup@@ id to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why we know all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez , the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed only to drive a few blocks away before his rotating Toyota Cor@@ olla , was born from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; &quot; T@@ wel@@ ve River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the cap took away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .

but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans re@@ leg@@ ation last year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t battles of the country , since ri@@ v@@ alis@@ ing political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t make nothing that in Sin@@ alo@@ a will be shot every day someone or more people on the street , or that the cemetery fully is eliminated , two @-@ sto@@ rey mouse @-@ een for drugs that are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only one Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs @-@ commercial routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of its work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , with the gu@@ ilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ conc@@ eptions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ v@@ alist anti@@ trust actions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans S@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , alleg@@ ed Gang@@ es bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had the same story to leave the country to its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad ; and his daughters is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
&quot; he was engaged in 2003 as an experienced rec@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues to the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to prov@@ oke journ@@ alism without encounter the pre@@ d@@ ow@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the paper served its reputation because of cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and publicity . &quot;
&quot; re@@ por@@ ters loved it , hard retro@@ spec@@ tive studies without fear of c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship , and the reader were cap@@ tiv@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories otherwise . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history , wherever it was . &quot;
he gave himself up voluntarily to that he had fear .
&quot; I want to live on &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drugs in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must take up the task that goes to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I do not want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do so many still@@ ness ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team miss Val@@ dez , the Sp@@ a@@ ß@@ vogel , who was like a port worker , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher , who knew how to survived . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Man@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
now she ask : was his love to routine his verb@@ s ?
his death has also forced her to ask her own assu@@ mptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secre@@ tly , and lan@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even at the best times , a high degree of self @-@ c@@ ens@@ or@@ ship and self @-@ confidence . &quot;
his own inst@@ in@@ ct trust .
&quot; when it is wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , said the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; od@@ or is a sense that can be decei@@ ved ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are in Sin@@ alo@@ a , no more - just as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a gi@@ fted mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corru@@ pt government ministers are at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff met by Ri@@ odo@@ ce to safety training , were suddenly not allowed . days previously announced that Spy@@ ware , which is only used to governments for monitoring journalists and acti@@ vi@@ sts in Mexico . &quot;
outside examined two polic@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
&quot; they were commissioned by the provincial government , the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ story quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the joke , some of the re@@ porter were some of the re@@ porter , whether this officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen , which are governed by Govern@@ or itself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ por@@ ters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drugs in the de fac@@ to under control are standing . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has collected on three main layers .
there was the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the Bru@@ ders of the former famous Box@@ er Ju@@ lio Ch@@ á@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state , which focused on the hom@@ etown of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that conducted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or , a kid@@ n@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who he was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it came to pass , so , caution was offered , so it was time to write , what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drugs and administr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ por@@ ters was made of public records , that the restaurant has been registered under the name of a policy , who ruled the N@@ ative Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which prev@@ ailed nearly all the centuries all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ Gou@@ ver@@ ne@@ ure were acc@@ used for high @-@ time cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ por@@ ters to write about previous inci@@ dents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escap@@ es a military waste . &quot;
&quot; only a few months before , the reader had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most important source of the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously we had already known what happened , &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; &quot; due to its slim body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who prot@@ ector against the mor@@ de of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : acti@@ vi@@ sts in the name of the press . &quot;
a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ ut@@ or .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez has been killed in the western federal state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country journalists have become more intense by drawing up in organised &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on sal@@ ads and buil@@ ders . &quot;
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez in Washington and is trying to collect international support for the judi@@ ciary in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the govern@@ or of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Val@@ dez defended the authorities , journalists and to leave them , because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that she is in@@ divided by the government again , because it is concerned that their anger has been in@@ ju@@ red their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico by organised crime , in order to be involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his final book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that re@@ por@@ ters are not only killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces , which put in organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials in the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you see because they want you reach the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mor@@ de have a det@@ er@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of B@@ log@@ ger@@ in Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as a six years ago .
&quot; your body was found together with a note that was sup@@ pose@@ dly signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer le@@ ash and ear@@ phones after her separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dents Miro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez were publicly available on the drug cart@@ els with a leading article on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists are fil@@ med out of their home states or even from the country .
it is a pain@@ ful decision .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find jobs in exile , and they still watch the streets and looking for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it seems obvious to the photographer Re@@ ub@@ en Esp@@ in@@ osa , which was founded in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay , and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ et , indicates that the drug gam@@ bling takes him fright@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became Re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; after midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on the civil war before the office and d@@ rank beer , when at once all their phones began . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ en@@ ri@@ v@@ als and security shops in the proximity of the beach Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed T@@ ote .
the war continued on how it promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
from the B@@ ord@@ stein@@ k@@ ante they published the news on the site of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ en he@@ ul@@ ls nearby - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a view to the polic@@ emen , the guards stopped to see if they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
if they had no fear at all they showed it .
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the folded founder of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for all Sin@@ alo@@ a , followed the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce its traces . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about it , Bo@@ y@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day was mur@@ dered at the J@@ avier , the internship would ask me to send it to the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur used to so@@ ak his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue if also a fright@@ ening .
&quot; now researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbeliev@@ able Nas@@ orn of a Canadian Ber@@ gar@@ aker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well maintained that they even could find that his created skin from red@@ dish Braun was - and they said , they had something of a &apos; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; describes it as &quot; &quot; the Ot@@ toman din@@ os@@ aur , who has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ au@@ rs spec@@ im@@ ens of the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossi@@ l is a newly discovered kind of No@@ dos@@ aur , who lived in the middle of the waste time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well er@@ ected state has researchers , which describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot; &quot;
according to reports in National Geo@@ graphic is the ar@@ mo@@ red plant . the best preserved fossi@@ l of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock in the board , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2.@@ 500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ anu@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a little chat with the eyes blind , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
&quot; it is going to enter the knowledge history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ os@@ au@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found that this plant e@@ aters , although he has been covered with a arm@@ or , and a changing tanks , probably threatened by meat and send din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide themselves before car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , and used an shiel@@ ding technology that is known as a counter@@ part that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix themselves better into its surroundings and so@@ ak its enemies , saying experts , which suggests that it was threatened by greater din@@ os@@ au@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was made for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Muse@@ um@@ ental Equipment Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document patterns and form of sc@@ ales and arm@@ our over his body .
&quot; they discovered the Con@@ sh@@ ady , a widespread defensive method in the animal @-@ empire , which means the tip of the creature dar@@ ker was than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far from those who live today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it points that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs had enough pressure due to meat and send din@@ os@@ au@@ rs , the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use con@@ den@@ sh@@ ading - think of racks , z@@ eb@@ ras or G@@ ür@@ g@@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a boot@@ y , which was sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ rs was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ y behaviour on a massive , strongly ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ aur show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs had to have been , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur red brown was .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his constant depic@@ tion , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs died , when he died , into a river , and went out into the sea where he s@@ ank into the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ os@@ aur is really remarkable , because it is complete with con@@ serving skin , but also in three dimensions is retained and the original form of the animal was re@@ tains , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost as much like in the early morning time .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just have a little chat with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is on sleep . &quot;
&quot; the che@@ ating time was a time , as a huge ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ v@@ ating din@@ os@@ ol barrier , which stood on two legs , the earth passed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them lived , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ os@@ au@@ rus rex , million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ os@@ au@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fright@@ ening ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ os@@ au@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons of heavy mon@@ ster monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings in the journal Current Bi@@ ology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been s@@ ank after the death in the sea and in mud m@@ um@@ i@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ en@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the busy din@@ os@@ au@@ rs din@@ os@@ aur of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have up to 3.000 € ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contains two 20 @-@ inch long leaders , which rag@@ ed by its shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant @-@ fres@@ ser was curved through the western Canada , until a flo@@ o@@ ded river it flo@@ o@@ ded into open sea . &quot;
but the underwater re@@ imb@@ urs@@ ement of the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs made his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the hidden rem@@ n@@ ants of this special specimen are so well received that the hood is still b@@ ump@@ ed up to the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs along the din@@ os@@ au@@ rs
how Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Geo@@ graphic is such a level of conservation so &apos;@@ rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to .
&quot; the more I see it , the conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ri@@ fied Rest@@ e of the skin still cover the hol@@ low@@ ed tank , which wear the sk@@ ull of the beast . &quot;
its right front @-@ foot @-@ foot is on his side ; his five fingers are split up .
I can count the sc@@ ales on his sole .
in the storm : mass @-@ aram@@ bol@@ age on A8 : many Ver@@ last
he@@ f@@ tly accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : barely 30 vehicles are wr@@ apped in a mass @-@ edge bol@@ ts .
&quot; there are numerous promise , mile @-@ long st@@ ints - and G@@ af@@ fer . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) are late for late Thursday morning at a mass@@ ages of about 20 people .
&quot; after the first information of the police , between the junction Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a th@@ under@@ storm nearly 30 cars , including probably also trucks , in@@ consecutive . &quot;
the exact number of the last documents do not provide any information before .
&quot; it is about light to moderate bre@@ ads , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a big scre@@ aming of lif@@ ebo@@ ats was at the accident .
the A8 was completely locked in direction of Munich .
in driving Munich a approximately ten kilometres long re @-@ return .
like an AZ re@@ porter has also been reported on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - thanks to numerous g@@ af@@ ers .
the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ le fe@@ ared the characteristics of the vehicle anchor that has now reck@@ on with sensitive str@@ apping .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , then a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
in doing so it was a coll@@ ision between an auto@@ ot@@ ran@@ spor@@ ter and a truck .

German Rail : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that has almost never experienced almost every one : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or it is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a ingen@@ ious thoughts .
and then : exhaust .
comes the ar@@ aff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an uns@@ an@@ ft or att@@ acking the driving center in the middle of the workflow .
Bo@@ ard@@ games .
but times of interru@@ ptions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ et the perfect driver card control .
&quot; you simply confirm with mobile phone , that you have taken its place and evalu@@ ates the driver card . &quot;
currently there is a test run on two routes .
&quot; comes the offer , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other traffic routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a train speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the train the passenger &apos;s standings without Sch@@ aff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or a tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked a online ticket - what is already doing most passengers .
&quot; it also has to have bought it over the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is why the most convenient type of ticket booking is . &quot;
and finally one needs a seat .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calling his ticket under &quot; My Ticket . &quot; &quot;
the test customers will then be released a button to electronic de@@ valuation .
the draw@@ string get on their mobile devices a message that the g@@ ast is located in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
comes the draw@@ backs at the driver card control to place Y white he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used for passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to travel relaxed without ticket control through our traction personnel , ch@@ ok@@ en in the DB Navigator just yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the guests to make their travel time in train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing Director of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often go underground , knows that apart from del@@ ays and pas@@ sions the chassis checks the biggest nu@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; for often , one has themselves , in any case , but one of those who do not need all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online @-@ tickets . &quot;
&quot; either missing the credit card or the recruitment card or otherwise a document , which you have to proceed . &quot;
&quot; the result are endless discussions between draw@@ backs and wag@@ g@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in the evenings or grand@@ children and del@@ ays in control of your own tickets and takes the Sch@@ aff@@ ner at the end time takes care of other concerns . &quot;
&quot; yet , only a small number of test customers can use the new service . &quot;
and this only applies to the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other traction numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sh@@ aken at its core .
&quot; only one day after it was arrived in New York City , that was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ elle apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she st@@ um@@ bled across a post from someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it still lies on the street , it was meant there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else had the information posted on her feed , closed on Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on its tim@@ eline ret@@ we@@ et@@ et .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ aff@@ ated black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , which was killed by a white polishing in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live to twe@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he posted a image of brow@@ ns alive , who was spread on the road and stay four hours there . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , I thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
you put her cell phone to return on the evening to twe@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people , the prescribed , and by a man , the claimed to be a sign with the wor@@ ding : &quot; Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on police has just killed my un@@ ched son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed in which a polishing is in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bell@@ ished dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , she &apos;s a different politi@@ cian to be f@@ le and cr@@ ying , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; re@@ minded people in their statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and that we can call it typical .
at that moment I felt sho@@ ok .
I was angry and we@@ pt . &quot;
they booked a return trip and went to the next day at home .
after the landing at 23 o &apos;clock they took her 6 @-@ year daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would drive to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; , &quot; in the cin@@ em@@ as from 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ ant , of strength and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter , which had a flower dress and a suitable crown contributed to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , pra@@ ises the two a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; re@@ minded them to what she said . &quot;
&quot; we go now to Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her , &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it has to know it and to see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free to free to release ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have luck to give her a experience in which they personally have no e@@ kl@@ ant rac@@ ism , it is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on , is located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was on a Camp@@ sit@@ u as the acti@@ vi@@ sts on the possible non @-@ indi@@ ct@@ ment of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson included . &quot;
&quot; there were Fer@@ rell , and her daughter joined with a local business owners , the lunch made . &quot;
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ov@@ es to pass them to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of acti@@ vism began to take shape for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed to the 9th August totally changed , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ urses Association and focused on eating equity and health inequality in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ director of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , her and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ r@@ ar wanted &quot; &quot; document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to Medjugorje in the sense : &quot; &quot; want to document it , or attempts to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benef@@ ited by her pain and their resi@@ li@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently declared in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who have born in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , who is known for his acti@@ vism around To@@ de@@ str@@ act . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after brow@@ n@@ gles . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we talk &quot; , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be represented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is in the movement &quot; not about a Messi@@ ah leader , but also a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , show documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s life , how they love themselves and her wife mar@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability at this work , and in the destro@@ ying of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls is repeated history the role of black we@@ eping women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ of Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as Schw@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; black , we@@ ule women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight constantly on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , sw@@ ule women must carry the main last of all . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it consists that &quot; &quot; this is not a af@@ fir@@ mati@@ ver type of action &quot; , &quot; in the Fer@@ rell , due to their identity as the heart of the movie . &quot;
&quot; she was the person that re@@ ap this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coinci@@ dence , although she was at the front front because in a life on these clo@@ cks as a black , sw@@ amp woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel her energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras from Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on has long gone , but the racial connections between the community and the police remains . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is about 2 ½ years because of the rec@@ ti@@ fication of a highway during a demonstration .
it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area that they called their home : &quot; a m@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they lament on a voc@@ als and she feels that memorial , since she went three years ago in Fer@@ g@@ us@@ on on the road . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size &quot; : TV @-@ reader Disc@@ uss about bit @-@ Gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping center at the southern part of the pedestrian zone out@@ dated since the first presentation 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
&quot; cold , the issue is hardly any one . &quot;
on our Facebook @-@ page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; will be discussed .
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; this would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; This would be genuine &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; does not need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ auen ) or quite simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates are building that there is a gallery more customers to the city , from which the rest of businesses will benefit , fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; add : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , at which the farmers market hall is available in the 13 Gover@@ ning market . &quot;
the construction works will be at the end with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Bed@@ a square with possibility of sitting outside sitting .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also the same .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ensing : &quot; whether Direct market is market@@ ed in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the level of rent . &quot;
this is likely to be very low in the new project but not just low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping car@@ es in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; ob Cl@@ othing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ie@@ - or supermarkets : I find the su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
one can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; however , since there is not even a new weekend market , it is all the more important that at least get us at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; for all , the goods offered is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above @-@ pure budget . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , stores are listed in a shopping centre just by larger companies , because the dor@@ sal mi@@ ds are often not portable . &quot;
&quot; too bad , specialty shops are almost no longer and what is still left , then will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market live during the construction time ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in duration , when the bit gallery will actually come . &quot;
or it creates the g@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ gallery before to drive all the stores from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , requires no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmers market gi@@ b it is thanks to the wa@@ ist many - like I find - point@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no place more .
&quot; if the farmers market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates por@@ traits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the center of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ comparable to the cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 por@@ traits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Hair sections that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sh@@ ick@@ ed the cuts out of prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former Secret Service Analy@@ zer has been a 35 year @-@ year warran@@ t after they considered as secret diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is A Bec@@ oming @-@ bl@@ ance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ wife and leading dis@@ si@@ dents , whose condem@@ nation was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which could be created by Mann@@ ing , and out of 30 por@@ traits , as well as something intellectual comment may not only be interpreted to the form@@ ability of DNA @-@ data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the intimate determ@@ in@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condem@@ ned for six charges , including six violations of the sp@@ ying network , computer was and theft . &quot;
&quot; due to the prison her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a gra@@ vel@@ ous , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a drive seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ ch has been associated with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 @-@ project &apos; stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; they produced the artist Por@@ traits of stran@@ gers from for@@ ensi@@ c arti@@ facts like cigar@@ ette st@@ um@@ mel , and chew@@ ing g@@ um , extr@@ acted the DNA from the waste to establish a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a period of time .
&quot; she led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in j@@ ail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so they took contact with Chelsea , and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA @-@ portrait . &quot;
the artist and their domestic M@@ use were led to un@@ equal pen@@ pal which ex@@ ert several letters over the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one of the Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stration Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lies Images &quot; , &quot; which the future was forec@@ ast@@ ed in which the President of Chel@@ tal judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release were calling for seven brut@@ al years in a military gar@@ nis in K@@ ansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and Star@@ kes , since Donald Tru@@ mp leads to war against inform@@ ants from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid sp@@ inal circuits that he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange time@@ ing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things are happening from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery pre@@ written Mann@@ ing with their over@@ big signature , among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end of &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis of gender , race , sexuality , and culture have been . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA @-@ sequence - a thousand @-@ speed of C@@ s and GS and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoff@@ te , by involving the 200 letters ( or Nu@@ k@@ le@@ ot@@ ids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) like amazing , at least in biological ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people of hopefully bring to take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above mentioned com@@ ic @-@ novel@@ s . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing as she is emerging from the disciplines as King @-@ Kong from the United States like King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech cold , then they have won it , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; thus never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; said the artist , who greeted in Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get goo@@ seb@@ umps , if I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was pres@@ cient in the Com@@ ic@@ book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks , which co@@ res like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic h@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted that they feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the por@@ traits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted that it feels like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which also stuck behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford because of their appearance
a nationwide w@@ rought is underway for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford who had been looking for a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fat@@ al injuries .
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ dham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ t , due to the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au presented , like the Ak@@ ten of the C@@ ook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , after several styles died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police force of Chicago published shared @-@ related warning system , that the corp@@ ses was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries at his body . &quot;

La@@ them has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at the North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the Vice President for University relationships , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them can now be in be@@ ur@@ lau@@ gh and excluded from the establishment of the North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case that is examined by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates on this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ an . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ person for the university and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail declaration that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , in contact and willing to help us in every concei@@ vable manner . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want it himself .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects of the authorities to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize it , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza @-@ building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip , who had just happened to the home of 1008 . &quot;
the police described the scene as a very cru@@ el .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was un@@ clear whether the inci@@ dent took place on 27 July .
&quot; it was confirmed by security cameras , that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building . &quot;
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza released a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the O@@ pf@@ res and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic inci@@ dent . &quot;
&quot; we will close the W@@ ada timetable in the near future &quot; - the Russian vice premi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian vice @-@ premi@@ er Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said , it will not take long until the remaining criteria in the world @-@ Anti @-@ doping agency ( W@@ ada ) to restore Russian anti @-@ doping agency ( R@@ USA@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; in a specific stage of meeting the criteria of the schedule , R@@ USA@@ DA has the right to plan and test it in cooperation with Ukrain ( UK anti @-@ doping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada timetable was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with code which describes the criteria for re @-@ setting of R@@ USA@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , it does not contain anything that could give rise to concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results are presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list described however , however , that the Russian anti @-@ doping authorities reported the reported results of the W@@ ada endor@@ sed by Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly accepting nation@@ ally funded d@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation through , as our anti @-@ intelligence system has existed . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not ad@@ mit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words voted with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ intelligence Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov came to the past in Russian anti @-@ doping organisations , then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains contro@@ versi@@ al positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has written this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ USA@@ DA was excluded in the course of the doping sk@@ and@@ als presented by the W@@ ada of the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ doping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the main building of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ USA@@ DA moves into the right direction . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promise anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not work with the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has been called for help from the outside . &quot;
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ x@@ ing to help companies to find out how their employees feel .
&quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing of software that has the specific purpose of the measurement of co @-@ engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , special groups and dem@@ ographic groups , employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint to contact the C @-@ suite managers and to contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Str@@ ava and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , Co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; we told that they have a better insight into what your employees think and won in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that displays at a glance , which units have most complaints and what managers low commitment results have to offer , why . &quot;
&quot; businesses come to see that at the top of the workplace culture will have to remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , which has been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , which has been published a blog post by the ones who have spoken , pun@@ ished . &quot;
for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value , after the finance technical site Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and to recognise , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ nb , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , conver@@ g@@ cent companies tailor @-@ made &quot; &quot; puls@@ ation &quot; , &quot; send confidential answers in real time and view the warmth of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line with the employees to be able to report .
&quot; and if the main business guide is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that its staff is treated poor@@ ly , or un@@ eth@@ ically beha@@ ves , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee cur@@ ation and lay people , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25@@ ,000 employees and over 500 locations , conver@@ g@@ cent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business centre . &quot;
&quot; sooner if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , form a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to pursue complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; well , since the company lies conver@@ g@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden in cities or states , hidden in offices in cities or States , as opposed to discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ stable practic@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree of view into the experience of employment , Vit@@ rano , which leads the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and co @-@ engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for eth@@ ic violations by the En@@ ron @-@ scan@@ dal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took , until the &quot; social media to their right came &quot; &quot; that companies knew that you could not prevent that their dirty laundry online went online . &quot;
&quot; before use of technology for monitoring ethics , men used hope as a strategy &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and loads the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that supports the consent of Venture Capital investors , which supports both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ cent was awarded $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sap@@ phire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; glaz@@ ed up $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , considering the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees of their jobs can expect more than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects for in@@ serts .
the employees want the feeling that you accept and be appreciated and that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are glad to be in a company , feel their voices , and that the work you are doing , then said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Employe@@ e Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both conver@@ cent and g@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors can reach rank@@ y when their portfolio companies are well run . company running well if staff are working and eng@@ aging .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of the employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on staff commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are us@@ eless if the administration of a company cannot take action .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks staff to your feedback , it may have an expect@@ ation that changes in the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change did not come fast enough , or not at all , can cultiv@@ ate these dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4@@ ,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4@@ ,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has to rely on the collection of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you are not going to follow staff , &quot; H@@ ave ye really heard ? &quot;
do you take care of this ?
&quot; and whom do not worry about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now a monthly employee surveys , was able to commen@@ ce action at the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was new to organise the decision @-@ making of decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to organize several teams within the company and add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday the company receives new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this leads to a better bond of workers in a industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;

for a good part of the team this un@@ active minutes make a lunch break .
players who are written to the summer courses are returning after the thir@@ sty exercise to their final auditing before they will return the next morning at 6 : 30 pm to the water@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real trekking , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday was closed . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the player and it has been extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock to meet the already fully @-@ packed sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood is postpon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
you should keep in the course of August 18 Ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es . 20 before the start of the formal toys for their pre@@ lu@@ de against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he set the rules of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add the busy itineraries of the players to add another point . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous loading three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging &quot; , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pushed it up , they are drawing on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
&quot; U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices , as soon as the camp ended , what is given the clear sig@@ hting of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which has already been viewed with foot@@ b@@ ust , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Player should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a spati@@ al that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people can rent a room and then adjust it there to draw an exercise . &quot;
if you have the video and from an exercise it is a pretty good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not have too big concerns .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with Fal@@ z@@ feed@@ backs to fac@@ es@@ hop@@ pers and their results under the original contribution , then the world &apos;s largest online @-@ social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight the F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website that it will start with the use of updated machinery methods , to recognize possible mis@@ ery and to vali@@ dated them to fac@@ tor@@ ing inspection from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was considered one of the main points for the called F@@ ake @-@ News , so many believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political topic in Europe , whereby the French voters were flo@@ o@@ ded in the ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan , after the social media networks , if it does not succeed , h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings as before the elections there in September fast . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that I will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of Fak@@ uma parties are challenged , the people want to meet more context in order to make decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product management for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be his feature to the &quot; &quot; test &quot; &quot; in connection with the related articles and to other changes to his news feed , to decrease false news . &quot;
creating an Com@@ ic @-@ Class : a Castle in the History of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a Squ@@ ee@@ ze music video and was a can@@ ter for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ he years .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years turbul@@ ent history of his cozy headquarters in Be@@ w@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent , and now it is now for inspiration for a graphical novel by Jam@@ ie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ one with a pre@@ dil@@ ection for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful , to look at the manuscript of somebody who has been dead since 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ck . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;@@ um@@ sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection , which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only responded to the Th@@ umb@@ nails on the side of a letter , that was written by a double room in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his durability !
&quot; and letters have always called smoke , because at that time , one flo@@ at a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who be@@ aten with old pap@@ er@@ ates that he lived from the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have been a little exag@@ ger@@ ated to be true .
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vic@@ t@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and to study the many treasures and curiosity of the castle , like the mon@@ ed Hy@@ än@@ enk@@ ins , at the walls and the bottles , which had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emig@@ rated through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke with land@@ lords , garden@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked at the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night d@@ rank er &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was first received in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes a decade later met , the employees started to take care of the archive , which he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Arist@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , Cast it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; books , letters from the time of English sens@@ ations , maps that represent what poss@@ essed : &quot; you could mean that land fli@@ ct be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection are using the castle as a base for a bre@@ iter@@ ate base in the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , who leaves a man who re@@ built the newly built castle to join the peasant distance from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a revol@@ t , the 13@@ 80 in the castle entered in this book with the title &apos; Kn@@ ight@@ ly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farmhouse started in this area and I thought , an u@@ prising was a good beginning . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the palace - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jes@@ u@@ it patent , which hidden the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , he made a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery , which was made only years later than its coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the men sh@@ es to be quite a cro@@ ok , getting back debt and spend money for things which they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men extingu@@ ishes their debt , by doing rich old women - I imagine it as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to adver@@ tise adults . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes in search of other unique write @-@ experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel on Als@@ ati@@ m@@ um@@ ki , the grounds of a San@@ at@@ ri from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish again with the dam@@ n life . &quot;
campaign started : more than 300 years old Marien@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the adju@@ sting of the 301 years old Marien@@ chapel in Rh@@ en@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( circular dated Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; still until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team will stick to Nel@@ son Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it is to be the highlight of the campaign a festival on the island of Graf@@ en@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on her yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
&quot; and in order to make it clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems . &quot;
&quot; basically , we are the firm belief that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single @-@ ste@@ er promise , one that gives the city an un@@ mist@@ ak@@ able all@@ ergy . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ digit amount can be the city of Bad Honnef their new umbrella brand and the campaign cost .
military reforms in Turkey - Erd@@ og@@ an fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August at Ankara the Ober@@ ste Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on P@@ ensi@@ on@@ ics and Be@@ verages in Off@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps .
this week as well .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine for the Turkish forces , one year after the cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the letter , as before , but at the beginning of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; the coun@@ selling of government is now also the five Vice @-@ President , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
these were the civilians in the Y@@ as in the number of transi@@ tions .
the government moves in the military the bre@@ eder .
&quot; the overall letter Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the comm@@ anders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were buried . &quot;
since the cou@@ p cou@@ p has consolidated Erd@@ og@@ an 169 of 326 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of cultivated connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erd@@ og@@ an as a wire @-@ wire of the cou@@ ch@@ attempt@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; for 486 people who shall have been involved directly at the cou@@ p attempt , this week has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the put@@ sch , Erd@@ og@@ an had called the overthrow of the &quot; &quot; Wor@@ ker &quot; , &quot; as he gives him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erd@@ og@@ an has really a handle on Erd@@ og@@ an ?
&quot; at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hürriyet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ fixes in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; in the general pole there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; &quot; of the army , which manifest@@ ations among others in the repe@@ al of the he@@ el @-@ bot@@ s for sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big pu@@ rest of the army and the security forces continues at any rate .
&quot; mid July Erd@@ og@@ an by decre@@ e made another 7@@ 395 state @-@ service , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it seemed to be t@@ og@@ an to the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual men of the country .
three times they under appeal to their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the world@@ ly stat@@ ure .
&quot; after his election in 2002 , Erd@@ og@@ an had back the power of the military step by step , not least on appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erd@@ og@@ an de@@ rei@@ be specifically pro@@ gres@@ sing by the armed forces of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; war@@ ned a nam@@ eless officer , who sought after the cou@@ p of fear of persecution abroad asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in the alliance , there is no doubt in the alliance to the su@@ peri@@ ors of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the executive structures and oper@@ ation@@ ative skills are &quot; &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; , &quot; say N@@ ato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immig@@ rant plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tru@@ mp , commented by the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead to reduce the legal immigrants to 50@@ ,000 per year , more str@@ ingent regulations for the creation of visa for an independent working permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the legislative process is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do so by the US will change the way the citizens from other countries Green Cards will be printed . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new applicants will come to the candidates who speak English which will have the financial means to support itself and show knowledge which our economy will get good , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to operate route for race at a time
&quot; again , over the past few months over the future of the racing season has been denied - now it is supposed to go quite fast . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , on the mar@@ row course , on which the tourist track goes , built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race at a long @-@ term basis , according to the transport of the Ministry of Transport , we should start working on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ steig to order and to guide , the country is primarily important for tourism , &quot; declared traffic secre@@ tion Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of repairs carried out the track on approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country will take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle is to be ordered in the future of the country , I will still be adjusted , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Moravian Railway as the operator can be discussed over the technical details already .
&quot; thus the timetable , the used vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Bahn@@ gesellschaft shall be closed for a period of eleven years .
this is the race shuttle to be ordered at December 2017 .
the Racing Shuttle is mainly among the tourists popular train connections between the train stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ steig .
&quot; during the past months , we have been tested in the course of a pilot business , whether the track is used by sufficient many people to order it in the future again . &quot;
the circuit is also strongly painted in parts .
&quot; the rise of sex robot is real , and we should worry about it . &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it could not be a crazy report , a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a big deal .
recently published the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) report a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to the Noel , Professor of Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and Co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their Ascension . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of wr@@ ap@@ ern@@ els . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver every quantity of it , and we will get them much more frequently to see , &quot; says Mr Shar@@ key on the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot@@ ics with a si@@ con@@ ium that feels warm - with deliber@@ ately human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can customize his robot according to his beliefs &quot; and thereby select everything , from the eye color of the robot to the type or color of his fing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturb@@ ing , as many robots had the &quot; personalities &quot; to look like a Step@@ ford woman pro@@ gressi@@ vely . &quot;
modern sex@@ pupp@@ ets have developed to robot@@ ic with a si@@ licon .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to properties , which they find pleas@@ ing such as tim@@ idity . &quot;
and then there is the von True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold robot with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah . &quot; the impression of tim@@ id@@ n@@ ness con@@ veys and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , dirty the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she does not like what you may not like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has its m@@ oods - quite as real people ! &quot;
&quot; you can be tired , be fixed on con@@ vers@@ ation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturb@@ ing aspects in this climb of sex robot - not least because they can replace real human relationships - but most of the frequent feminine properties , the an@@ play@@ ings to r@@ ape , if one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is said here : resi@@ li@@ ant ) Far@@ rah goes on most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibration but for men .
&quot; if women are able to have a vibration , why can men then have no ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it is called on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just a different angle . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and increasing refin@@ ement on something dar@@ ker and deeper into our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course take no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted its rising popularity , they remain preliminary on the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what distingu@@ ishing from the edge @-@ zones , in relation to the spirit of time , in which we live , very instru@@ ctive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or offensive until they are the free market for this .
&quot; there are nevertheless a certain consideration that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time , in which the rights of women are threatened around the world in which it has been named in the White House who has been sexually attacked , women sexually attacked . &quot;
the det@@ er@@ ous aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s Tale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the Mag@@ d &apos;Azur ) are not the graphical images that acts with the slim body and the hardened eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a lea@@ p , but at the moment , this does not feel like a great lea@@ p . &quot;
the goal behind this sex robot is to establish a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically fe@@ a@@ sible ( if also with por@@ traits ) .
&quot; their buil@@ ders want that they feel humane , that they will im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
you can not separate from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that could disturb@@ ing on independence or anything , which could disturb@@ ing the fantasy of total sub@@ ju@@ g@@ ation . &quot;
in other words : they are counter@@ ing slaves .
or to express it in the Re@@ de@@ wise of 2017 : maid
Tru@@ mp@@ s big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the in@@ compreh@@ ension of the healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a binary @-@ welding of the Tru@@ mp @-@ era that have polarized the US @-@ weighing hop@@ pers , even families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest , there was also in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the hor@@ ror of Tru@@ mp and relatives . &quot;
we will all sup@@ pose@@ dly give us all al@@ lege@@ dly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mp@@ s , families together . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my c@@ ous@@ ine , a left @-@ align@@ ed po@@ ster@@ er that lives in Chicago and has long been employed with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who has been visited this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that the unity can have a powerful effect for a common enemy .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kind@@ red , with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and very peculi@@ ar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks to it . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to move all right to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we talk of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the gr@@ illing opportunity that we will no longer encounter his k@@ ittens from one day . &quot;
&quot; but there is a still @-@ distance long @-@ time scenario , in the Tru@@ mp Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards , suddenly as in@@ compreh@@ ension of neg@@ ligence . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ neys , the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact occur to a very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; if Tru@@ mp goes , the next Candi@@ date of Republi@@ can only be spirit@@ ually healthy to qualify as in@@ im@@ meas@@ urable improvement . &quot;
&quot; as my c@@ ous@@ ine in the city was , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ wi@@ ells of New York Park@@ department , and the top three dollars you can spend in the city , if one needs no caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous large , the fiber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ acking and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ pping music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; five years later , and I am still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact no Swiss cottage - the topic pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a great deal at the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ carousel is still a strange magic experience , since here two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he years can go on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could judge the carousel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily one has asked him afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to settle the score with a 15 % gratu@@ ity - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor wife in the Kauf@@ haus was exc@@ ellen@@ ingly , while I felt tired of experience , to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pi@@ stor@@ ius with ni@@ ches out of prison to hospital
Pi@@ stor@@ ius left the prison for a hospital visit .
&quot; last year , he was transferred to the hospital because of the treatment of li@@ vest@@ ments to the hospital , which he suffered the pris@@ oned authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pi@@ stor@@ ius was condem@@ ned for the first sh@@ ame@@ works against a call of citizenship .
he spar@@ ked Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valent@@ ine in 2013 by giving them several times by a door of the Toil@@ et in his house in Pre@@ toria on her .
&quot; Pi@@ stor@@ ius said that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ ly in@@ tru@@ ders , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; citizenship have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year of the imprisonment of Pi@@ stor@@ ius App@@ ell , from which they say it is too indul@@ g@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Auth@@ orities said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the obj@@ ection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pi@@ stor@@ ius &apos;s risk that its punishment is increased to 15 years when prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ night@@ club were released from Fü@@ tzen and E@@ pfen@@ hofen into the holidays and into the continuing schools . &quot;
three of the students continue to go on to the school in future in future .
&quot; school @-@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the civil house Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pfen@@ hofen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes chose the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ le , who grows in the chicken , then nevertheless the freedom will be released . &quot;
&quot; this led the m@@ op@@ e Sch@@ ar a Musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in Ch@@ icken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold was a strange egg , and did it out of his chicken br@@ aces . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a little eag@@ le came out . &quot;
&quot; yet the hope to make out of him a chicken , cr@@ ying , the eag@@ le spread on a high mountain its wings out and escap@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the classes showed three and four in the study of Yv@@ onne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ ers , the cylinder tru@@ sts , around the w@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; the eag@@ le stand for the integration , says School@@ leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
the squ@@ et may be different from other young animals ( chic@@ ks ) but belonging to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wished each four @-@ t@@ kl@@ ank@@ le that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it followed thanks to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who has always jump back in teaching and the parent company . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what they need to know now
how accurate will the software update place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel Summit BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group software updates for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars are offered . &quot;
you should improve the exhaust @-@ behavior of automob@@ iles Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in by Ace Auto Club Europa are available reviews :
is the new action compulsory ?
no , the updated software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the oblig@@ atory updates previously apply only for the cars , the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
whose retro@@ fitting has arranged the power of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced another term implementation in the coming months , but not an exact date . &quot;
Daim@@ ler has communicated to write every person .
&quot; if there is one inspection , this will be done in their context . &quot;
how long can the circum@@ cis@@ es get in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the relationship between the commitment of the manufacturers as well as by the political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary , the mot@@ ility act on the subject of environment so far not . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
cont@@ actor could be able to get an appointment .
&quot; do drivers do that do not drive a car from BMW , Daim@@ ler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE is waiting for the wait .

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony will be promised by President Tru@@ mp to become politically .
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives first Rap@@ per for one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cul@@ tu@@ tion of Thursday announced , this year also belong to Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) , as well as the chore@@ o@@ grapher Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;

&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will organize a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the presentation . &quot;
the winners of progressive TV @-@ series known Le@@ ar was already announced to re@@ lin@@ qu@@ ish the participation in the g@@ ala .
&quot; the &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this Presidency has chosen to negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to escape the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make their view . &quot;

we make the city living @-@ living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s town treas@@ urer in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the job is already written - suitable applicants are r@@ ar . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker Fin@@ meister .
and the work is still great fun as he con@@ veys in the press meeting .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also challenging tasks that waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ad@@ mi@@ red it that so far no application can be applied to the application profile . &quot;
the city looks for the next time an architect or building engineer .
&quot; thus , in compliance with the regular notice of cancellation - even enough time for a change . &quot;
&quot; da Has@@ lach was in charge of the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applic@@ ant must be made available . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they can no longer fill out these , the citizens would have to go for advice to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but citizens is important to the city and to him , W@@ acker tells W@@ acker from a good company , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accum@@ ulated on the w@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city li@@ vable , he is dedicated to the construction department and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower @-@ parking place are about . &quot;
the se@@ ven@@ ing bridge between B@@ oll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the stadium @-@ restoration is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech when we do &apos; s right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all are great tasks on my success@@ ors .
the work here is fun . &quot;
craf@@ ty be present for a city master large room area .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building and garden@@ ers can be flexi@@ bly to react very flexible .
&quot; you can move a lot , so W@@ acker , and the design of the founders would often be pra@@ ised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble under monument protection stands , be it important to have an eye for it , which clean@@ ings , if new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the schei@@ d town master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the building master carries great responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end everything is running here about my table . &quot;
&quot; when taking care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( buildings ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( Deep @-@ construction ) has been for 15 years now . &quot;
&quot; also , that its successor is long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for somebody who really identified and stay with the spot . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who Roland W@@ acker wants to provide information about the city of Has@@ lach a complete study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialized in architecture , and have good expertise in the fields of construction work and construction projects . &quot;
&quot; building office are under@@ standing high and low @-@ building , building planning , Gr@@ int@@ ric@@ ating affairs , administration of the urban grounds , urban operation with Bau@@ hof and city garden@@ ers , as well as sub@@ contractors and sub@@ ordin@@ ance , including monument protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : south @-@ trail locked
&quot; according to police , the blue bike had thrown down the blue bike of the railway tracks in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so heavily damaged that the left @-@ down goods had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort were witness@@ ed by witnesses a ro@@ sar@@ oter Roll@@ ers and a bike driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ st@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to APA . &quot;
or the perpet@@ rat@@ ors had brought themselves in great danger and also threat@@ ens the train traffic .
&quot; apart from the damage to the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the transport car , and the cost of rail traffic can also be added to the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the railways . &quot;
&quot; overall , from a &quot; significant &quot; total , &quot; the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ route could be led without handi@@ caps . &quot;
almost 10 persons there were Fri@@ day@@ morning afternoon , two of them che@@ ating the traffic . &quot;
&quot; goods coatings are not falling , but they had delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres above .
ins@@ ulators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate might help IB@@ D ( infl@@ amm@@ ation intest@@ ine ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your diges@@ tive system as a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could alle@@ vi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1,@@ 3 million and in Britain 300@@ .000 , causes mag@@ nit@@ ude and blo@@ ating , recur@@ ring or blo@@ ating waste , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected usually come , meat and dairy products come to avoid their symptoms , found researchers at the Wash@@ ington@@ er University out that the essential amino acid Tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an of proteins to contribute to developing immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the leading researchers , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol , to make sure that dam@@ aging micro @-@ bs which penet@@ rate themselves in the body , not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , the insur@@ rection are , infl@@ amm@@ ation of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without being sensitive tissue . &quot;
when the balance is too far in the direction of infl@@ amm@@ ation it can result in a infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ ine .
&quot; experim@@ entation has been established that a type of tolerance condu@@ ci@@ ve immune cell in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires te@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an - one of the components of proteins to cover the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we got a connection between a bacterial era - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ine micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tri@@ pt@@ oph@@ an mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he pointed out that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i , and one of Tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an dietary diet toler@@ ates less infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal tract , when the same system promotes people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral office in Dr. Luisa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an under@@ search@@ ed a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when they found out that a group of studies did such cells , but another group of the same tribe but that was not separated . &quot;
&quot; they susp@@ ected that the difference with the intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ omes of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , which usually live in the stomach @-@ intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the hard@@ ships of mice were found DNA sequ@@ enz@@ ed and were found six bacterial species available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing with the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were re@@ ared in a ster@@ ile environment , so they were missing a intest@@ inal micro@@ bi@@ ous and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria growing on the immune system , the researchers have reu@@ ter@@ i into an liquid , and then over@@ led small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on in@@ mature immune cells that were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ anced cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an metabolism that is known as In@@ do@@ l @-@ 3 @-@ militar@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have dou@@ bled the quantity of Tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ ones were hal@@ ved , the number of cells around half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ rag@@ an explained that people have the same toler@@ anced cells such as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our stomach @-@ intest@@ ines .
it is not known whether Tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an auxiliary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i will develop the cells in men as with mice but defects in genes in relation to te@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ an were found in people with infl@@ am@@ mat@@ ory intest@@ inal diseases .
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells control infl@@ amm@@ ation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially potentially high Tr@@ y@@ pt@@ oph@@ onic values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed
&quot; at Manchester United has signed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; geni@@ us &quot; , believes in Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on the Wedn@@ es@@ days his debut against s@@ amp@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game , before the UEF@@ A @-@ Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressive in the neck @-@ roll , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after Bel@@ i@@ eben . &quot;
&quot; MAT@@ IC was however excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia @-@ tour of the blues and made only 45 minutes , what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had to improve since the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a geni@@ us in the way he thinks he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be prepared earlier than later .
&quot; besides M@@ atic started also Victor Lind@@ el@@ u and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u im Avi@@ va @-@ Stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;

&quot; new draft for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turning it : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel , SPD @-@ chief , S &amp; D Prime Minister of elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no interference in the party &apos;s central , simply no counter @-@ wind from the covenant - so was the most important desire of the elect@@ oral power . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees were observed from the Willy Brandt house with growing the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach again . &quot;
there were st@@ aves .
and indeed one by the others .
the covenant @-@ CD@@ U looks to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this once again shows more : red @-@ green can simply not be sure , &quot; &quot; CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber the board network in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ ett@@ lement of a Green MEPs over@@ thre@@ w the government of Prime Minister Stephan W@@ eil ( SPD ) was over@@ thrown into a serious crisis .
five months before the day @-@ day @-@ election he lost its red @-@ green coalition with the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Govern@@ or Michael Kell@@ ner has called the Ab@@ tr@@ sin@@ ful Nieder@@ s@@ ächs@@ ische Gre@@ ke T@@ hou called to return their mandate .
the connection to the CD@@ U means a clear distor@@ tion of the voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ella must immediately be returned to her mandate , &quot; said the Federal Government leader and elect@@ oral manager of the Gre@@ ens of the Board of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true not true , si@@ si@@ sts a SPD @-@ elect@@ oral struggles , when the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bot@@ s reaches the party &apos;s central position . &quot;
&quot; Stephan W@@ eil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green members of El@@ ke T@@ esti@@ bu@@ le to the CD@@ U without own ruling majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD .
and no one knows what to come next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
after the agricultural elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
that was then also - and although everything was clearly worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the dov@@ es , the Düsseldorf @-@ ple@@ ite Haute the party smooth . &quot;
the comrades intensi@@ fy the comrades in the weeks after that .
&quot; then , when they had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next draft .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD &apos;s head , lost its Nim@@ bus , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmony , while his city burned . &quot;
and because he made up pretty much in the crisis communication after that what one can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz was fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan W@@ eil .
&quot; because of the VW exhaust and its role in the super@@ visory board , the Lower Saxony Minister has already been in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ esis Re@@ fr@@ age@@ values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe this reason why W@@ eil attempt@@ ed to keep getting stronger in the covenant between past weeks . &quot;
&quot; the am@@ bition of the former Mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin was not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they allow him to give him a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; now , the exact opposite could enter . &quot;
&quot; at this time , W@@ eil meets the @-@ party internal compul@@ sion , the Dutch countryside is basically no fault . &quot;
and certainly not at all .
&quot; however , the comrades make an effort to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is based on the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the deport@@ ed parliam@@ ent@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , such as woman T@@ ests their own career heads about the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD Bundestag ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ ella is not elected because of her person as a direct service plat@@ inum , but by the state list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens . &quot;
the logical consequence would it be that she returns their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Bundestag , indi@@ cted an &quot; und@@ em@@ ocratic man@@ o@@ eu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ or@@ ate four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan W@@ eil to the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony as a leader in the colorful @-@ election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now adul@@ ter@@ ated the personal career of future CD@@ U @-@ MEPs the che@@ er result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann more . &quot;
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there is more or more we have been handed over to the CD@@ U Niedersachsen .
conveyor belts for me@@ ats III
&quot; who wants to be commented in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
in the informal Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative Ste@@ g Urban Development on Wednesday in emp@@ fingen .
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ ind@@ ler gave another review to the so far .
since 1991 it has been written in the refurb@@ ishment of refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; at that time , in the San@@ ation period I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg have been adopted two thirds of the funding . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment II from 2005 to 2016 the grant was still at least 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous refurb@@ ish@@ ments are a &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the interior development , and not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , you will receive the information from the Govern@@ ors Karlsruhe , the information that there will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding tot@@ alling 833 333 Euro , of which were received more than 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the church . &quot;
how is now a renovation area ?
&quot; you will continue , examine so Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but there is also a role , whether in the planned sphere of interest you are interested in . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could then be shi@@ fted once again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ g agreements at the Wedn@@ es@@ evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Countries Programme &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; , &quot; where the renov@@ ations would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; the core of the programme are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and conservation of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be obj@@ ected , which means per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , only once the inventory was carried out , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area involved a questionn@@ aire to fill out the question . &quot;
&quot; in November or December the set of proposition is to be made possible , so that in the coming year with the refurb@@ ish@@ ments can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that every Commun@@ e has carried the bes@@ ieg@@ ed pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it &apos;s why to evaluate the urban development of confusion and decide when san@@ itation , and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property there is also a san@@ itation in the basic book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come again and make a picture of the position , he sp@@ ake them . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , it will be frag@@ ile that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionn@@ aire is the &quot; &quot; building and real estate &quot; , &quot; in which it is among other things about the structural condition and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionn@@ aire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and ro@@ omm@@ ates of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; is only available when building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , to note , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled questionn@@ aire cannot be at the same time an application to funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new structures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler stressed that the distribution of funding means according to the &quot; wind @-@ dog principle &quot; - who comes first , ma@@ iled first . &quot;
&quot; you could not receive funding for later &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Locations II &quot; were shown to make the present a renovation &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish invent@@ or advoc@@ ates himself a micro@@ chip in order to come with a hand @-@ movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish invent@@ or is the first in the country who is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can enter his door@@ step to enter his office and even start a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had impl@@ anted the tiny chip between th@@ um@@ bs and fore@@ finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify her life with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ative An@@ a@@ es@@ thesi@@ sts in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together , to ensure that the impl@@ ant @-@ method is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs impl@@ anted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;

the advertising costs of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands .
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine Hel@@ icopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which costs American production in the last month , tax pay@@ ers will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the statements of the military , which have been left to the T@@ IME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Sik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president on board was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and conduc@@ tive officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was made next to a yacht of Maine , a fire@@ man made of Wis@@ cons@@ in and a for@@ kli@@ ft from Mississippi River . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the hel@@ icop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter of the Marine Hel@@ icopter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit that is responsible for the operation of the hel@@ icop@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted that you are aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the comm@@ anders of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his super@@ vis@@ ors , the dep@@ uty mar@@ g@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter was issued on 17 July at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 o &apos;clock and so long stayed until the tur@@ f was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
&quot; the note adds that if the departure should be del@@ ayed out of the White House , due to the limitation of the service hours a second team would need for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight @-@ crew was at the event at the Hel@@ icopter while the security personnel of unity during the time remained on the ground by plane .
the design@@ ations made available from the T@@ IME provided was not clear whether ultimately a second flight @-@ crew was required .

records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question that we asked , was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch A@@ cts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the comm@@ ander . &quot;
&quot; sounds , as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy @-@ Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political cl@@ ones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a breach of the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts for the w@@ ning of government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is out of politically beneficial purposes is hardly any new phenomenon . &quot;
Presi@@ dents are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , to request their use only for a photo @-@ OP , is un@@ common . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp carried out in February an investigation by the back of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that utilize the presidential plane through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - which shows the products from all 50 states that will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; the Deputy of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 @-@ cre@@ ws perform often training courses in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn through to reset the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; as a Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 led in the White House of 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; Event for@@ ged with the workout requirement of the crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; helicopter @-@ units fle@@ w in addition to 11 hours in this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers have been the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Sik@@ or@@ sky said , the company was not involved in supporting the hel@@ icop@@ ters in the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ ing design@@ ations for the presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Ministry of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 is the DO@@ D refund for the V@@ H @-@ 3D however 24.@@ 380 USD per flight .
records of unity draw the flight time of the plane as a 30 minutes from the hom@@ etown of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the hel@@ icop@@ ters is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for the refund can be determined is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the refund of DO@@ D does not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at this time the former press pre@@ aching of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the hel@@ icop@@ ters for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Sik@@ or@@ sky and the federal state Connecticut very proud to contribute to our national security , and I &apos;m assum@@ ing that hundreds of people are not dependent on thousands of people . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have been ti@@ reless .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to empha@@ sized that . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp with the helicopter was inter@@ viewed , when he prayed to the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man car . &quot;
in the White House Tru@@ mp to the representative of Sik@@ or@@ sky and decre@@ ed with the media about his own fleet of products .
&quot; I know Sik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

top pioneer of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga occurs in the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ re SV .
the TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will tomorrow morning at 11 clock in Kiel at the Tab@@ ell@@ end@@ re SV in Kiel .
&quot; despite after five games , more mac@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance sheet , the top pioneer of the Second tennis Bundes@@ liga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has any respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which plays always in quite similar forms . &quot;
&quot; especially on the rear positions , I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer SV are above all the imports from the high north .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and fin@@ s can even refer to in@@ serts for the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also greatly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with view to Har@@ ri Hel@@ i@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , Andre Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben Ol@@ esen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ dre@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is always hard for us . &quot;
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ vier .
&quot; this is the moment still creating the Chall@@ enger tournament in Italian Bi@@ ella not for the Bundes@@ liga game , coming in the tournament in Czech Liberec game Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for his first use in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defe@@ ated Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the white rus@@ sia An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in Kitz@@ b@@ üh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ri@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgi@@ ans Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two vict@@ ories last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ t@@ é Val@@ eri@@ z could again put again into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is sufficient for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , which was in January 2016 still the number one of the Jun@@ iors Wel@@ d@@ rank list , not , fill someone from the trip to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tru@@ mp does not , when he met his signature under the law for the intensi@@ fication of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his h@@ ast , the law prescri@@ be , the congress was packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels seemed to be fo@@ aming against the US @-@ pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design looks ahead to pun@@ ish European enterprises that help Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , there are investors in the domestic O@@ MV , which is co @-@ financed with other European firms the construction of the Russian east@@ ward North Stream 2 . &quot;
the drug back@@ drop is powerful .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estim@@ ation of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil Group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp even should aw@@ aken the sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has been viewed , which could reject the Group and which could really we@@ ht@@ un . &quot;

the city back@@ wards : the city represents 46 chefs
the city organised the K@@ ita @-@ L@@ unch again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban kinder@@ gart@@ ens the clock will be revers@@ ed .
&quot; at the 1st of September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the me@@ al@@ tru@@ sts in the urban children &apos;s local communities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , vice @-@ president in the field of youth aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we all felt very happy . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it continues to be out of house : a Cater@@ er takes over this task and delivers fresh air @-@ cooled . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the Kre@@ feld area 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 get the children to lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the last year Kit@@ a@@ year , 2800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , we eat not only children who are looked after 45 weekends in the K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support when children up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 sections , from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the delivered food items , supplement them around salad , raw materials and fruit , por@@ ate the meal individually , give the food from , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees will be assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides on the timetable .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly part of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger involved and it is easier for the war , pe@@ dagog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for that is why it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the children shall help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen to the team is as useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleans@@ ing of the K@@ ita @-@ spaces - so far as the task of the kitchen forces - will be completed in future from special cleaning personnel .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to quality improvement of the kitchen &apos;s performance even the charm that they issued in the cost comparison between self @-@ reg@@ imen and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical display says it out of the press .
&quot; and that , although 46 sub @-@ forces will be re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall within 750 people in the attrac@@ ting area not so strongly into weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union would like to make a trade union with the managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it vend@@ or Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company defe@@ ating the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the plant that poses next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be experienced as the first , if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branch of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie , to express any concerns that financing will not lead to the modernisation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organizer of Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain no clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families worked here and work on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of life and the chron@@ ical production process , the eastern end of Glasgow strongly encourage a thri@@ ving production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade unions . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are active as all companies that are active in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe economic climate , our business regularly review - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to competitive competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as the production site , and should change our operating sequences at the location , the employees and their trade union agencies will be the first to learn . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona has been war@@ ned three years ago .
the page of La Liga likes her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain is in its persecution of Ne@@ uro , after it has made an offer of £ 189 million in order to reject his release cl@@ ause , but have it war@@ ned for Barcelona three years ago . &quot;
&quot; the sens@@ ational approach has heated the transaction window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season for 89 million pounds to Manchester United . &quot;
&quot; after completion , for the most expensive players of the world and for the most vulnerable professional ath@@ l@@ ete of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way of being forced upon the way , despite being a source in the vicinity of the Catal@@ ans board , that the club has always given his best to look after his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 to take care of him . &quot;
yet the soccer world was war@@ ned three years ago by the PS@@ G President in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ ui@@ di fought , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best players made by PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know when they touch one of our players , then we will contact them in opposition to them , we will contact their players &apos; , said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign up , so this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exce@@ eded these line , with the Spanish club in the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not permit it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by giving them one of their pricing for beginners . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ report ent@@ angl@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the ab@@ normal cases un@@ paved pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
that means author and histor@@ ians Michael H@@ es@@ emann .
the final report for abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; explained according to the German press agency , he met by the former Reg@@ ens@@ burger bishop and today Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . , an exc@@ use . &quot;
it would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would deep@@ en her deeply regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or her back false estimate of the proceedings .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , the &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that in the reporting about violence in the cathedral @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the handles in Regensburg , two @-@ f@@ le no one that would have to be sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts of action , but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; so the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Man@@ ip@@ ulation &quot; , &quot; as the author of Luc@@ etta Scar@@ af@@ fia , histor@@ ians and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit , the ca@@ tho@@ lic church as a source of all evil experience , is already part of the day @-@ experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion that hold for normal , writes Scar@@ af@@ fia . &quot;
also Princip@@ al Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis said in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; one would like to go on to the church and that &apos;s a flow@@ chart .
&quot; in addition , it pointed out that in her youth &quot; saw a completely normal pe@@ dagog@@ ical means &quot; &quot; to be with friends , as I was one was finished . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ ests it unfair , today &apos;s standards on past decades of use , for the world have changed . &quot;
in connection with the reports about the abuse cases often pop@@ e also pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; totally to inj@@ usti@@ ce , author and histor@@ ian Michael H@@ es@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; M@@ ein brother of the Pope &quot; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says H@@ es@@ emann , &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; it evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report which is presented by the Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg with the clari@@ fication of Ulrich Weber from Bi@@ st@@ um Regensburg ?
&quot; a total of 547 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of convi@@ ctions , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , there is to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in conclusion , so that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. is applied in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , contrary to numerous other signs that many victims rose up to the general crimes of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview H@@ es@@ emann , why the final report for mis@@ use by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion over@@ bur@@ dened . &quot;
Mr. H@@ es@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; inci@@ dents of non @-@ violence at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; gives a contradi@@ ctory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
&quot; to one , many students stand out his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the other he also appears as chan@@ cell@@ ist and perf@@ ection@@ ist , which was built in the ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has brought no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate the Bio@@ grapher of this final report ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one must still wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has to present at all in it . &quot;
he is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the medi@@ ator or compassion for the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
even the assurance at the pre @-@ university climb@@ s outside of its impact .
&quot; you can have to look at it , at late , or have taken the first attack not seriously . &quot;
&quot; the domain name , on which he was acting , was received from practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent result , describes it as &quot; &quot; warmly , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; &quot; competent , bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons fail and &apos; always car@@ ved by grapes . &quot;
&quot; merely a minority compl@@ ains about its perf@@ ection@@ ism and its high em@@ powerment , which also led to bro@@ ods . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only fi@@ red with the chairs and cast on the ground , but also ear@@ rings and too fre@@ ed guys in the hair or ears , he has already lo@@ dged himself years ago , deeply regret and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor@@ ary salvation , however , it must be said that such education methods have been widely used in the frag@@ ile time , the 19@@ 60s and 1970@@ s , as well as by parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us , who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a sec@@ ular school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually going on in this report , namely , namely , namely , the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the ant@@ agon@@ als at the pre @-@ school , are the release of Bag@@ els . &quot;
&quot; you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his famili@@ arity and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media is watching on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e , many who have never understood it , still @-@ free@@ zing . &quot;
the truth is : the report ent@@ angl@@ ed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media has been reported in connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the Final Report as well as some cl@@ apping or comp@@ ression with regard to sexual abuse at the load ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : very clearly no .
no single of the 67 victims of sexual handles claims to have entr@@ u@@ sted to the domain master .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I have never been dre@@ amed to talk to my father or my mother about it , &quot; said an suffer@@ ers of acting for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem during the education of sexual abuse was and is that the most victims were silent .
&quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
how do you rate the domain @-@ cats R@@ atz@@ ing@@ ers role in terms of abuse cases ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : a ques@@ tion@@ able pup@@ ates so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had broken up ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and the respective perpet@@ rat@@ ors could have been stopped .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd , accept that would be counted among him ... Bub@@ bles un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able or clear@@ er or clear@@ er or more likely to be opened as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ cour@@ ers , Trust @-@ taught etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that he has entr@@ u@@ sted to him in advance , students and / or their surroundings , could not be confirmed in the framework of investigation . &quot;
&quot; what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any fellow @-@ wis@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in this way it cannot be thrown , it cannot be prevented or brought to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these res@@ war@@ ful crimes , as unfortunately it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; conscience &quot; was to read &quot; with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look forward in the report &quot; &quot; Send &quot; . &quot; &quot;
do he have to live with this proposition ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything was missing and men@@ ses to a huge mel@@ ange taken from sexual abuse and abuse and somewhere , in the midst of the midst of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; however , this is exactly what is an abuse of the rec@@ ti@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; namely , there will be clean separately : between the pre @-@ school and the gymnasium of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and tissues as well as , we say once , other pros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report received inci@@ dents from the time since 1945 , so also for four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral head of the cathedral @-@ cats . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble spec@@ im@@ pe@@ dagog@@ y , the cases where cr@@ abs by s@@ adi@@ stic , instruct@@ ors were land@@ ed and rec@@ kl@@ ed , ex@@ propri@@ ated themselves at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ hofen , where truly sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only to face , when they were already on the domain name . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the sole propriet@@ ors empha@@ size , the theme of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to be her ent@@ angl@@ ed and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different on the cathedral park ?
Michael H@@ es@@ emann : there might be discipline but not s@@ adi@@ stic violence .
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims are estimated to combine the general crimes of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; so at most still the eve , away to have . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations at a school , where he did not want to listen and responsible ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again to 1993 . &quot;
closed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school , which the report was even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in that he points out this , &quot; that in the pre @-@ school continues to practi@@ se the test . &quot;
&quot; already in the light of the danger of negative awards , he received an urgent check @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; of course , this was of course at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as a test that was long recently b@@ anned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they inher@@ ited them in a legal gray zone , as each of us is probably still white . &quot;
&quot; there was also difficult for him to estimate , where those affected might be exag@@ ger@@ ated or dramatic , and where really the per@@ missible limit was exce@@ eded . &quot;
&quot; however , one can also not say he would have always been away . &quot;
this just is not true .
the test was officially inaugur@@ ated in Bavaria in 1980 .
&quot; princip@@ ally Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis maintained , yes , it was unfair to apply the pe@@ dagog@@ ical standards on the dam@@ aging time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : we have histor@@ ians speak out of &quot; &quot; Fall@@ on of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger , past , according to present moral measures . &quot;
then the prin@@ cess has already been right .
&quot; but this is of course not true for sexual abuse at all times , and also not for what was in@@ cum@@ bent in the school of resistance and violence against in@@ tox@@ icity , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all quite aw@@ ful and I am happy that it finally works .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , for all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ rings and drag@@ ging in the hair and ears , were widely used in the 1970@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then it was forbidden , it has also strictly kept . &quot;
&quot; which image of his reg@@ ens@@ burger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic exam@@ ining your language too ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , as played the cathedral @-@ cats just a side @-@ role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not by any means that he carried out there a str@@ ingent Reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but this must be said once again : without these Perf@@ ect@@ ism , without the claim un@@ conditional discipline , it would have probably hardly possible to form a institution of world @-@ known govern@@ ors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tour . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singer and stand before each success , just to what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ monitoring . &quot;
as what kind of people you have lived Georg R@@ atz@@ inger for talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael H@@ es@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I &apos;ve experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and over again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , fundamental , deep glorious and heart@@ ed people , from which one cannot imagine that he could do something in a fly . &quot;
&quot; I come regularly with how many former cathedral @-@ cats are still alive today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , regularly contact him to visit him ; for him , he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not for@@ give him to today , that he was once strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he en@@ enriched her life and took care of the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , v@@ ä@@ ter@@ nal teacher - a hard father , certainly that may be - but nevertheless a not@@ able respec@@ t@@ person , to which they still have to look and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again very clearly : everything that you thro@@ ws him are educ@@ ators , which at the time were on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is prominent , and one still prominent brother has to make medi@@ al S@@ ün@@ den@@ bock . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , un@@ paved it . &quot;
&quot; now the settlement areas now would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps Germany probably no one to know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Germany ) , finally in peace . &quot;
