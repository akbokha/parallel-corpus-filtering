<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State Missouri, who shall come into force on 28 August 2017, calling for Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, because a number of fragmentary, rage-based incidents in recent times occur throughout the state and noted that it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes people severe to gain discrimination, as well as the enforcement authorities of the State, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to extract the backbone, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are kept for their skin colour, they are merged or killed," said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear discomfort in such cases, which we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning which issued the organization for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist suspending against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"sin died in fragmentary circumstances beginning of the year after having had no gasoline any more, and taken from the police by Missouri in prison, without a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report of the office of the General Office of Missouri, in which it is shown that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more frequently than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff will inform about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be willing to bring it to Kaub, or let the relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>

<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union had been issued for the European Civil Liberties for Texas and Arizona, having passed the local prosecution authorities to keep people due to immigration violations, resulting in view of ACLU to further rationing."</seg>
<seg id="66">"Reisewarcalculations tend to be issued by the State Department for other countries, but in recent times interested parties have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weidiscreet project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherbacher Weidefence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have created a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"with the rectangle of the family Schwendemann met representatives of the fishing village CDU local associations, together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two parliamentarians."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann affords first insights into its operation, in which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest managed, 40 milk cooling and also houses many virgins and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black-milk "" is for him the alternative marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the holiday guests only comes to Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as it is also a BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he describes the wheelsets project as" elementar. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not profit on such parts.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work that can be edited by Motorsense.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," stressed Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the elternal operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run any bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the meaning of the woman's regime and is pleased with the leader of the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euro per hectare, the farmers had to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">You hope that the reforestation of the areas could still be moved out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they continued their operations," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">More than 25 plots were fenced in 2013 and 25 plots from eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares that will not be reaffolding until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of 71 500 Euro the half of the Leader was funded, a quarter carried out the village of fishing."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers love 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of wife."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landmen it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White was fixed:" "here the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state-of-the-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to be the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Requirement is the presence of one of the LPR marked by the conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the inundocative area must not be low-persecrecy (Hangtend to be over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"in 2018, the application of eight participants are currently running with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometers of fence at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area is 35 hectares, the cold costs are at more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest character of a regime change is, if they begin to attacking the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did, when he did a symbolic war with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the president to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller does not hold the statue itself. "</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of jatowners and Liberty Capitators would have suffered it when he would have done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he handles their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you have been written as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta, I don't want to enter a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that the world is illuminated."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem that you refer to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is properly true, but as he worsen it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the inflected words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only have any ancient immigrants, but the hassle of the poor:" "your wicked, your arms, / your afflicted masses, which then longing to breathe, and the elending waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"there was never a time, in which the" "miserable Abfall" "was to be seen on our screens better."</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engaged in literary criticism - he clearly did that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict due to the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural argument: it is indeed a conflict to the significance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who sat down their words after her death on the base - knew very well that they were a highly-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presented the female embodiment of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has got a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and an devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, the people wanted to change this far from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big screaming as Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued 2010, that the freedom of the Statue is not singular, but rather an early neocoonservative that the American flamme into the umreated world briinge:" Lady Liberty is going forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not shine the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limgragh here on something awake.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted of Lazarus as they seen by the exhaustive, elending, but hopeful people were seen after long and often terrible trips to the Decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is true in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of men, the refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not shine the path, but the hatred, who is their only source of power, ignite."</seg>
<seg id="128">WHC 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">"Eilidh Doyle remembers a time, when only two caves to the team of Great Britain belonged to"</seg>

<seg id="132">"black believes that in Scotland has to learn something special, and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes, medals are medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team for teamrider."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is pretty modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were shottically or wherever they live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the genuine feeling, the Eilidh completely included, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-silver medal, which is in its fifth world championship with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" "incredibly" "that 16 Shots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-screw-runners Muir leads on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5.000 m of the furnace."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m is another Schotte, which one was after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games included."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle members remember their first world championship as the only other Schotte in the team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain said that they are" enormously proud "" of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only a team but in some cases also in the medals and join the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special about team captain, lies in that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was anyway a great honor, but knowing that my team colates for me and have chosen to make it something special for me", "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the raots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we got.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podes."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech as a captain affects?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I'm going to go out a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics via Facebook: Bewirb will not carry you a public office if you cannot wear the heater of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long before the newspapers ask him because of everything from the internal policy up to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He shaking during the critique.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not brought his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for the year 1783, Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stumm we are led as the sheep to battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland governor Larry Hogan who must work on it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union defends him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the strip of the governor tuned the lawsuit as an frivol, and the online comment was full of a counterretraction with" Na, "and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a publican governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the two thest agreement of the 50 Governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary pinion.</seg>
<seg id="176">He demonstrated a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primorres, to connect with his voters and play their hairy head after chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore the blockation of persons who come to the side of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governors and arguing that the blockation of the comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of tropical or spammers or splash-filled people that goes online the peiting."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a master and a priest, no trophy."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all told that their comments are respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and sent to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawytin Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bolike, MD., was not hassertive, but she asked about hassing."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate break and other current news," wrote them in the commentary box of the post-announcement "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I also don't appreciate this idea if a number of people on the same subject take place, then they are disregarded by some more likely than a so called collective employment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors as" "concentrated" "concentrated" "would possibly call" "speech". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a crime, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot of cleaners than in earlier times when one had done the same thing that staff was sent, to collect and burn newspapers with critical leadership and to persuade and to sweep the protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what exactly is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticised the Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is charged by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County Verlast the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they called a voters of their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And Kentucky received Governor Matt Bevin (R) also a visit from ACPI because of its use by Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington the time of affordable porttos had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers often multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefs on his leadership. "</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had Trollme Trolle.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people, the pseudonyme such as Juricola," "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petition that has criticised its position on the contract of amity, trade and shipping with Britain and criticised his ministry, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreements and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="887">"up to date, Migrens announces 6.880 to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2.481 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">"eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assumed that the person may possibly be 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person is under 18 years old.</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistently resistant in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">"the high proportion of cases where the person has been assessed as over 18 years, does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have suffered over his age."</seg>

<seg id="899">Assessing the biological age in this way is very insecure.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can not safely say it, we should not do as if we could it," he said the newspaper Metro. "</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests:" generally you may say that the risk to assess a child as an adult, is low. "</seg>

<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people together in a White House, which sets out of competing parties, and again try to present their own agenda by bringing Trump Material, which could possibly help their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Poltico - quite busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants that surpassed the President out of strategic reasons.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the Weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and irrevocal drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on this day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what you feel safer: you are supposed to take their children with the office, the 2009 aim of an attack with granulates, or to leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have three words on a blackboard on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporter, names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abs."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug associations, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are betrayed to the secret list of government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no callout of violence, and throughout the country the corpses, are more and more journalists at least 25, since then President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took up his office. 589 are after attacks and threats under states and until now there was at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is their publishers and their inspiration from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest error is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence associated with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence will be deeply felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows its midfinger with the word" "Justice", "on the façade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts that show its smiling face with spectacles or its typical panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss its shared topics, the trauma, their nightmare, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 has been a Sonder Bundesanwalde was erected to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee to protect journalists only two sentences."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder, connected every year with drug dealers and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed before the court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still consist of treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are invisible, and although the terrain is still oblique."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderer, without justice, the meeting in discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why we know all." ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15 Valdez, the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed only to drive a few blocks away before his rotating Toyota Corolla, was born from his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" "Twelve River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap took away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He leaves a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to be freely rooted in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans relegation last year and the delivery in the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battles of the country, since rivalising political groups are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't make nothing that in Sinaloa will be shot every day someone or more people on the street, or that the cemetery fully is eliminated, two-storey mouse-een for drugs that are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" peace "," if only one Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs-commercial routes in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of its work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of the rivalist antitrust actions in the war with Guzmans Sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, alleged Ganges bought every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez not to force after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had the same story to leave the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez has been a legend in Mexico and abroad; and his daughters is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was engaged in 2003 as an experienced recporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues to the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to provoke journalism without encounter the predowry problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the paper served its reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and publicity."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard retrospective studies without fear of censorship, and the reader were captivated by a publication in which they could read stories otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of the Mexican drug history, wherever it was."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up voluntarily to that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live on" "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drugs in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take up the task that goes to you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I do not want to be asked:" "what did you do so many stillness... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team miss Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was like a port worker, the friend, the generous with hugs and advice, a teacher, who knew how to survived."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Manabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she ask: was his love to routine his verbs?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has also forced her to ask her own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secretly, and lanways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even at the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-confidence."</seg>
<seg id="1865">His own instinct trust.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"when it is wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" odor is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are in Sinaloa, no more - just as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a gifted mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government ministers are at home."</seg>

<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drugs in the de facto under control are standing."</seg>

<seg id="1883">"only a few months before, the reader had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most important source of the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we had already known what happened," "Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El FLACO" "due to its slim body."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" "Current Biology" "describes it as" "the Ottoman dinosaur, who has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaur, who lived in the middle of the waste time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well erected state has researchers, which describe it as" really remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic is the armored plant. the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something that seemed out of the surrounding rock in the board, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to cover the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) heavy peanut."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only have a little chat with the eyes blind, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is going to enter the knowledge history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, the mona Lisa of the dinosauts."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this plant eaters, although he has been covered with a armor, and a changing tanks, probably threatened by meat and send dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before carnivores, and used an shielding technology that is known as a counterpart that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix themselves better into its surroundings and soak its enemies, saying experts, which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosdinosaurs was made for the first time in May and is now at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museumental Equipment Mark Mitchell, one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours with it."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document patterns and form of scales and armour over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the Conshady, a widespread defensive method in the animal-empire, which means the tip of the creature darker was than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta is far from those who live today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it points that the dinosaurs had enough pressure due to meat and send dinosaurs, the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use condenshading - think of racks, zebras or Gürganimals - are much smaller and vulnerable as a booty, which was signaled that this Nodosrs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong prey behaviour on a massive, strongly armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs had to have been," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaur red brown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his constant depiction, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs died, when he died, into a river, and went out into the sea where he sank into the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodososaur is really remarkable, because it is complete with conserving skin, but also in three dimensions is retained and the original form of the animal was retains," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost as much like in the early morning time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just have a little chat with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is on sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the cheating time was a time, as a huge theropoden, carnivating dinosol barrier, which stood on two legs, the earth passed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them lived, the tyrannosaurus rex, million years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta has been sank after the death in the sea and in mud mumified."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the busy dinosaurs dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have up to 3.000 €(1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contains two 20-inch long leaders, which raged by its shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-fresser was curved through the western Canada, until a flooded river it flooded into open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater reimbursement of the dinosaurs made his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this special specimen are so well received that the hood is still bumped up to the dinosaurs along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">How Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic is such a level of conservation so'rare as a gain in the Lotto.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken at its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after it was arrived in New York City, that was sitting in St. Louis Geborene on the bed of an Airbelle apartment that they rented and scroll through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post from someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it still lies on the street, it was meant there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else had the information posted on her feed, closed on Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on its timeline retweetet.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, an unaffated black 18-year-old, which was killed by a white polishing in Ferguson, Mo., killed live to tweets."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a image of browns alive, who was spread on the road and stay four hours there."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild, I thought Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">You put her cell phone to return on the evening to tweet on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people, the prescribed, and by a man, the claimed to be a sign with the wording:" Ferguson police has just killed my unched son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed in which a polishing is in front of a group of protesters with a bellished dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, she's a different politician to be fle and crying," "I will kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," reminded people in their statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to us and that we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shook.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">They booked a return trip and went to the next day at home.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 o'clock they took her 6-year daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two next morning would drive to Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets "," in the cinemas from 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestant, of strength and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, which had a flower dress and a suitable crown contributed to Ferguson, praises the two a conversation, which they had countless times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" reminded them to what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go now to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her," said Ferrell later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know it and to see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organisation, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free to free to release ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have luck to give her a experience in which they personally have no eklant racism, it is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, is located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was on a Campsitu as the activists on the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson included."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there were Ferrell, and her daughter joined with a local business owners, the lunch made."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and haloves to pass them to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed to the 9th August totally changed," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating equity and health inequality in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-director of the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, her and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted" "document", "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to Medjugorje in the sense:" "want to document it, or attempts to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from whites - in a community that benefited by her pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently declared in an interview:" "we heard that people who have born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, who is known for his activism around Todestract."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after browngles."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we talk", "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people will be represented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is in the movement" not about a Messiah leader, but also a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, show documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells's life, how they love themselves and her wife marries."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability at this work, and in the destroying of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells is repeated history the role of black weeping women in the wider Black-Lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayof Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify themselves as Schwul."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, weule women in leadership positions have borne the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight constantly on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, swule women must carry the main last of all."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement really is kept by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it consists that" "this is not a affirmativer type of action", "in the Ferrell, due to their identity as the heart of the movie."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person that reap this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence, although she was at the front front because in a life on these clocks as a black, swamp woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras from Ferguson has long gone, but the racial connections between the community and the police remains."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is about 2 ½ years because of the rectification of a highway during a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area that they called their home: "a mess."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, they lament on a vocals and she feels that memorial, since she went three years ago in Ferguson on the road."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size": TV-reader Discuss about bit-Gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping center at the southern part of the pedestrian zone outdated since the first presentation 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the issue is hardly any one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook-page "Volksfreund Bitburg" will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" this would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" This would be genuine "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "does not need a man" (Siggi Bauen) or quite simple: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that there is a gallery more customers to the city, from which the rest of businesses will benefit, fear that then the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"add: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, at which the farmers market hall is available in the 13 Governing market."</seg>
<seg id="2096">The construction works will be at the end with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and the Beda square with possibility of sitting outside sitting.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farmers market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether Direct market is marketed in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the level of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">This is likely to be very low in the new project but not just low. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping cares in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"ob Clothing, shoes, drugie- or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, since there is not even a new weekend market, it is all the more important that at least get us at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"for all, the goods offered is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is above-pure budget."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, stores are listed in a shopping centre just by larger companies, because the dorsal mids are often not portable."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, specialty shops are almost no longer and what is still left, then will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmers market live during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old Edeka would be the solution - even in duration, when the bit gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or it creates the gpenst bit-gallery before to drive all the stores from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, requires no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmers market gib it is thanks to the waist many - like I find - pointless building projects in Bitburg no place more.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"if the farmers market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the center of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparable to the cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Hair sections that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning shicked the cuts out of prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former Secret Service Analyzer has been a 35 year-year warrant after they considered as secret diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks. "</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is A Becoming-blance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transwife and leading dissidents, whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which could be created by Manning, and out of 30 portraits, as well as something intellectual comment may not only be interpreted to the formability of DNA-data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the intimate determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked about the identification as a woman since its puberty, was condemned for six charges, including six violations of the spying network, computer was and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"due to the prison her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a gravelous, black-white Selfie, in which Manning sits comfortably on a drive seat and a platinblonde perch has been associated with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012-project 'stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"they produced the artist Portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette stummel, and chewing gum, extracted the DNA from the waste to establish a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a period of time.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"she led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg with a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea, and asked whether she wanted to make a DNA-portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and their domestic Muse were led to unequal penpal which exert several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of the Shoili Kanungo Illustration Comic" Supplies Images "," which the future was forecasted in which the President of Cheltal judgment and it would be able to see the exhibition in person. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release were calling for seven brutal years in a military garnis in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also the opening of the exhibition a little deeper and Starkes, since Donald Trump leads to war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid spinal circuits that he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange timeing of all these things was asked, she said that" things are happening from a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery prewritten Manning with their overbig signature, among them (the" "i" "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end of" automatic fragmentation, whose basis of gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, her mitochondrial DNA-sequence - a thousand-speed of Cs and GS and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoffte, by involving the 200 letters (or Nukleotids after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist) like amazing, at least in biological ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people of hopefully bring to take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room is one page from the above mentioned comic-novels."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning as she is emerging from the disciplines as King-Kong from the United States like King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech cold, then they have won it," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"thus never stop the mouth." ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," said the artist, who greeted in Philadelphia. "</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, if I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition yet - as it was prescient in the Comicbook - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the center of the room by the masks, which cores like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted that they feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted that it feels like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which also stuck behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not be a crazy report, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a big deal.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently published the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) report a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to the Noel, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and Co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their Ascension."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of wrapernels."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver every quantity of it, and we will get them much more frequently to see," says Mr Sharkey on the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robotics with a siconium that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions which can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can customize his robot according to his beliefs" and thereby select everything, from the eye color of the robot to the type or color of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots had the" personalities "to look like a Stepford woman progressively."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sexpuppets have developed to robotic with a silicon.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to properties, which they find pleasing such as timidity."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the von True Companion developed Roxxxy gold robot with pre-programmed figures such as "Frigid Farrah." the impression of timidnness conveys and "Wild Wendy" with a "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible, dirty the site of True Companion."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she does not like what you may not like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has its moods - quite as real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"you can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this climb of sex robot - not least because they can replace real human relationships - but most of the frequent feminine properties, the anplayings to rape, if one goes a step on Frigid (is said here: resiliant) Farrah goes on most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibration but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women are able to have a vibration, why can men then have no roxxxy?" it is called on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different angle."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and increasing refinement on something darker and deeper into our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course take no sex robots, and while the FRR noted its rising popularity, they remain preliminary on the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what distinguishing from the edge-zones, in relation to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or offensive until they are the free market for this.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there are nevertheless a certain consideration that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time, in which the rights of women are threatened around the world in which it has been named in the White House who has been sexually attacked, women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The deterous aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the Magd'Azur) are not the graphical images that acts with the slim body and the hardened eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment, this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind this sex robot is to establish a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (if also with portraits).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want that they feel humane, that they will imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots do not represent real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that could disturbing on independence or anything, which could disturbing the fantasy of total subjugation."</seg>

<seg id="2427">"around Christmas and Erntedankfest, there was also in the USA newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump and relatives."</seg>
<seg id="2428">We will all supposedly give us all allegedly to burst our filter bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="2429">"less noticed is the power of Trumps, families together."</seg>
<seg id="2430">"I consider this because my cousine, a left-aligned posterer that lives in Chicago and has long been employed with the republicans in our family, who has been visited this week in New York."</seg>
<seg id="2431">They remembered that the unity can have a powerful effect for a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican kindred, with which she fought for decades due to politics, suddenly and very peculiar on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls me in a wider context that this also brings considerable risks to it."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the power to move all right to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we talk of" normalisation "and Trump, we refer to the grilling opportunity that we will no longer encounter his kittens from one day."</seg>

<seg id="2587">"experimentation has been established that a type of tolerance conducive immune cell in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires teyptophan - one of the components of proteins to cover the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we got a connection between a bacterial era - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestine microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more triptophan mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he pointed out that the combination of L. reuteri, and one of Tryptophan dietary diet tolerates less inflammatory intestinal tract, when the same system promotes people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral office in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan undersearched a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when they found out that a group of studies did such cells, but another group of the same tribe but that was not separated."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"the hardships of mice were found DNA sequenzed and were found six bacterial species available in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing with the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were reared in a sterile environment, so they were missing a intestinal microbious and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria growing on the immune system, the researchers have reuteri into an liquid, and then overled small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - on inmature immune cells that were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the toleranced cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism that is known as Indol-3-militarism."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the quantity of Tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophones were halved, the number of cells around half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same toleranced cells such as mice and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach-intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan auxiliary products from L. reuteri will develop the cells in men as with mice but defects in genes in relation to teyptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>

<seg id="2887">"the police are now witnesses of the incident, as well as the driver of the year-experience, under Tel. 05761 / 92060 with the Commissariat of Stolzenau in conjunction with the Commissariat."</seg>
<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-report entangled Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abnormal cases unpaved pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">That means author and historians Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are church, "explained according to the German press agency, he met by the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of Pope Benedict XVI., an excuse."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve to the reputation of the Catholic Church very much when Müller and Ratzinger would deepen her deeply regret about their own omissions or her back false estimate of the proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the" "Osservatore Romano", "on the other hand, the" Osservatore Romano "" criticized that in the reporting about violence in the cathedral-cats with "" two measure "." "</seg>
<seg id="2895">"with regard to the handles in Regensburg, two-fle no one that would have to be shameful and shameful acts of action, but the" degree of medial Manipulation "," so the "degree of medial Manipulation", "as the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit, the catholic church as a source of all evil experience, is already part of the day-experience and prepares the public opinion that hold for normal, writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Also Principal Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "one would like to go on to the church and that's a flowchart.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in addition, it pointed out that in her youth" saw a completely normal pedagogical means "" to be with friends, as I was one was finished. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">"they fests it unfair, today's standards on past decades of use, for the world have changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports about the abuse cases often pope also pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"totally to injustice, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who translated with Ratzinger the reminder" Mein brother of the Pope "(in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," it evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report which is presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification of Ulrich Weber from Bistum Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibility" victims of convictions, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, there is to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in conclusion, so that Domkapellmeister R. is applied in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially at high Emotionality, the punishment for the students could also disastrous."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, contrary to numerous other signs that many victims rose up to the general crimes of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Hesemann, why the final report for misuse by the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion overburdened. "</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of non-violence at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to one, many students stand out his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"to the other he also appears as chancellist and perfectionist, which was built in the öfteren, when a Domspatz has brought no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate the Biographer of this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one must still wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger has to present at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of the mediator or compassion for the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Even the assurance at the pre-university climbs outside of its impact.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"you can have to look at it, at late, or have taken the first attack not seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domain name, on which he was acting, was received from practically all respondents as - so literally -" salvation, "" Heaven "" and "" better world "." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent result, describes it as" "warmly," "sincerely," "competent," "competent," "competent," "competent, biscuits and Bonbons fail and 'always carved by grapes."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"merely a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high empowerment, which also led to broods."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only fired with the chairs and cast on the ground, but also earrings and too freed guys in the hair or ears, he has already lodged himself years ago, deeply regret and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honorary salvation, however, it must be said that such education methods have been widely used in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, as well as by parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us, who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually going on in this report, namely, namely, namely, the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the antagonals at the pre-school, are the release of Bagels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI of Benedict XVI, that many media is watching on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood it, still-freezing."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report entangled Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media has been reported in connection with the report very much about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the Final Report as well as some clapping or compression with regard to sexual abuse at the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No single of the 67 victims of sexual handles claims to have entrusted to the domain master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never been dreamed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said an sufferers of acting for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem during the education of sexual abuse was and is that the most victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the domain-cats Ratzingers role in terms of abuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable pupates so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had broken up (Georg Ratzinger) and the respective perpetrators could have been stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd, accept that would be counted among him... Bubbles unquestionable or clearer or clearer or more likely to be opened as compared to their parents, internatscourers, Trust-taught etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "that he has entrusted to him in advance, students and / or their surroundings, could not be confirmed in the framework of investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any fellow-wiser."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way it cannot be thrown, it cannot be prevented or brought to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these reswarful crimes, as unfortunately it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" conscience "was to read" with the Regensburger Domspatzen. "</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look forward in the report "" Send "." "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Do he have to live with this proposition?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything was missing and menses to a huge melange taken from sexual abuse and abuse and somewhere, in the midst of the midst of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"however, this is exactly what is an abuse of the rectification."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, there will be clean separately: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and tissues as well as, we say once, other pros."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report received incidents from the time since 1945, so also for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral head of the cathedral-cats."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible specimpedagogy, the cases where crabs by sadistic, instructors were landed and reckled, expropriated themselves at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where truly scandalous states have to be ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only to face, when they were already on the domain name."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the sole proprietors emphasize, the theme of" pre-school "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be her entangled and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the cathedral park?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there might be discipline but not sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims are estimated to combine the general crimes of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so at most still the eve, away to have."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states on the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the operations at a school, where he did not want to listen and responsible (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Closed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral school, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in that he points out this," that in the pre-school continues to practise the test. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the light of the danger of negative awards, he received an urgent check-in."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"of course, this was of course at a time when legal clarity was forbidden as a test that was long recently banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they inherited them in a legal gray zone, as each of us is probably still white."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also difficult for him to estimate, where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatic, and where really the permissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one can also not say he would have always been away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This just is not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The test was officially inaugurated in Bavaria in 1980.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"principally Gloria of Thurn und Taxis maintained, yes, it was unfair to apply the pedagogical standards on the damaging time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we have historians speak out of" "Fallon of Anachronism", "thus the danger, past, according to present moral measures."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is of course not true for sexual abuse at all times, and also not for what was incumbent in the school of resistance and violence against intoxicity, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite awful and I am happy that it finally works.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, for all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means for disciplining and punishment, so earrings and dragging in the hair and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then it was forbidden, it has also strictly kept."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger, because in talks with you for the book" My brother of Pope ""? "</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic examining your language too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, as played the cathedral-cats just a side-role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not by any means that he carried out there a stringent Regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this must be said once again: without these Perfectism, without the claim unconditional discipline, it would have probably hardly possible to form a institution of world-known governors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991) on tour."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singer and stand before each success, just to what area, but always discipline, passion and self-monitoring."</seg>
<seg id="2987">As what kind of people you have lived Georg Ratzinger for talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I've experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and over again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep glorious and hearted people, from which one cannot imagine that he could do something in a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I come regularly with how many former cathedral-cats are still alive today, 23 years after his Emergency, regularly contact him to visit him; for him, he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him to today, that he was once strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he enenriched her life and took care of the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always had a good, väternal teacher - a hard father, certainly that may be - but nevertheless a notable respectperson, to which they still have to look and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again very clearly: everything that you throws him are educators, which at the time were on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominent, and one still prominent brother has to make medial Sündenbock."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, unpaved it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the settlement areas now would have acquired a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without the outside of Bavaria, and perhaps Germany probably no one to know the Regensburger Domspatzen (Germany), finally in peace."</seg>
