gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
at the end of a golf courses in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with a horse riding on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses in their holiday evening they ch@@ asing in fast gal@@ op@@ p home to the feeding .
&quot; a few kilometers at this pace , I have had fear . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the horse @-@ career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fers of all times - 101 tournament asc@@ ents - back near horses .
he let himself lead to his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV . for a horse he mu@@ zzle himself not for photographs .
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen , and thus also at CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convin@@ cing .
the German sports relief after the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala the Gol@@ dene Sport@@ pyramid .
in distin@@ ctions it is not acceptable to the sympath@@ etic ath@@ l@@ ete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreu@@ z , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already hi@@ ed him .
long is the 18th prize winners of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means me a lot , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only for@@ give for sporting successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the off@@ spring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money from 25@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men the two @-@ fold US master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German sports . &quot;
&quot; among the excellent are the smooth Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard G@@ ien@@ ger , the Ru@@ dok@@ a Frank Wien@@ eke , the Su@@ dok@@ a Frank Wien@@ eke , the Spr@@ ite Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand@@ craft . &quot;
many of these sports legen@@ ds were on Saturday after Aachen .
&quot; after the official part , illustr@@ ate the illustr@@ e society in the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tru@@ mp@@ s economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and to prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policies between Donald Tru@@ mp and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state is over the role of the state .
&quot; Tru@@ mp wants to keep the doubts more small and war@@ ned against it , as the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
Clinton W@@ ool the economy to death on death and regul@@ ate to death he says .
&quot; he himself would be quite different , claims Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely drive regul@@ ators , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private craftsmen and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand says : the state has certain duties to fulfill , he has given a dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase for the rich , she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the m@@ ts , Tru@@ mp and Clinton will be fast . &quot;
the democratic applicants still announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; so , on Tru@@ mp there may be so many internal discussions . &quot;
&quot; clearly , the differences in energy and climate policies . &quot;
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ power plants and set the cohesion in the US again .
oil Sour@@ ces should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton wants to build and encourage renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only at the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two ri@@ vals are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sp@@ azi@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the United States from international trade , but just to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger chicken .
it wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp is to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must click , then he says he might not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on the one hand Tru@@ mp , who wants to ent@@ ail the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
his critics are holding it before and thus the bud@@ get@@ defic@@ it would only be larger .
&quot; on the other hand Clinton , the Clinton is at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and their critics are saying , more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women , who fle@@ es alone , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house does not offer refu@@ ge .
in a large kitchen they are sitting four women .
&quot; each one has a baby , the most one year old is old . &quot;
one has laid their little son in the arm .
he bu@@ cks with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother died on the table top .
until they realize that she is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and k@@ issed the little ones .
the scene remains normal .
until man speaks with Kat@@ rin Bö@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the area leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria , and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fe@@ ared .
they live in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodations for all @-@ owned women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs had set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ ch@@ ner Women &apos;s aid .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no more - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard against the door .
&quot; it is not exag@@ ger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has done on their escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men escape because of wars , because they become politically prosec@@ uted , because they post torture or death or because their families send them as hop@@ el@@ ists to Europe , tells them . &quot;
&quot; in women over@@ thre@@ w other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secre@@ tly , because they do not see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sive , volunteers , sla@@ very , sla@@ very or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this continues its driving .
on the run it continues .
&quot; that tu@@ gs to demand for a bottle of water is a sexual act , is not rar@@ ity , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end once they came into Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; also here , the women involved in refuge@@ e accommodations often regarded as inferior and hard@@ est if abuse . &quot;
&quot; this leads to about 90 percent of women , who live in the residence in the Mün@@ ch@@ ner north , traum@@ atis@@ ed , appreci@@ ates it . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are so used that they do nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t get to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not help , need more accommodation only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District rules are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; whether they feel like a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , reply some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are something about governments not . &quot;
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , women are not accommod@@ ated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Spok@@ es@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and mid @-@ fran@@ ken there are in some common accommodation floors or own homes only for all women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are being separated . &quot;
&quot; missing the privacy or become men and women together , it may come to - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as very the women feel this protection , one can read at the con@@ ges@@ tion that there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since having spoken around , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assist@@ ants : demands for new labour measures
&quot; representative of the assist@@ ants have inv@@ oked their uni@@ on@@ aries to make new labor force , with their disputes regarding a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested its entire council , from beginning of September more labour measures . &quot;
the J@@ DC said that it was Minister of Ministers on the concerns with regard to the contract .
assistance systems and medi@@ a@@ inst@@ u@@ dents have agreed in July on the rejection of a contract which has been agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who have adapted to the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , which was released on Thursday evening on Twitter , said the president of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government has remained &quot; har@@ r@@ ally quiet &quot; to problems that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; given that the J@@ DC Board has adapted to the proposed new contract completely ab@@ du@@ cted and official new negotiations on all those concerned . &quot;
&quot; an answer to the silence of the government has provided the J@@ DC Board today to form a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program es@@ kal@@ ine labour measures , which begin at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistant , this year six@@ sm@@ al strikes , the first general cases in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A assistant of Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to reject the agreed terms of contract , which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he divided BM@@ A members during the meetings that still found before the vote by 54@@ .000 assist@@ ants and medi@@ z@@ inst@@ u@@ Students , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Health Minister Jerem@@ y Hunt , the Treaty of doctors in England would be introduced to be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of outside parties &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to present their hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin has concluded his Turkish counter@@ parts in the gold @-@ gold Hall of the St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es , I cannot deny the inv@@ aders that Ankara will not want this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Put@@ ain sm@@ iles ru@@ ff@@ ed and he radi@@ ated hardly heat , for his re@@ amp@@ ed conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an on the other hand spoke to his &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper that Erd@@ og@@ an had said to have heard , as if never happened somewhat sharp@@ ness . &quot;
me seemed like his enthusiasm to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that the State @-@ ef of Russia had nothing to be forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his introductory , the shot of a Russian struggle of struggle on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to time was angry .
Putin divided and pre@@ ached Ankara , Russia in the back . &quot;
&quot; this even was even bigger , since it was committed by a mine friend . &quot;
chew@@ ing to re @-@ establish is difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media led a fier@@ ce , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed to be the door to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious officials were the acc@@ us@@ ations of leadership officials , that Erd@@ og@@ an &apos;s own family has benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that have been controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but at St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look at the front . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erd@@ og@@ an to the exc@@ use he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara the benefits of a cease @-@ fire is clearly obvious .
&quot; Erd@@ og@@ an needs all the friends who can get it , after it has been enth@@ r@@ alled almost his ministry for the last month . &quot;
re@@ peti@@ tive terrorist attacks on Turkey also sh@@ aken him too .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agency and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are taken up again . &quot;
they are counting on a delay in the Mediterranean .
this week predi@@ cted the living television cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported .
&quot; a report in V@@ ed@@ em@@ ost@@ i form@@ ulate it following : &quot; tourists there long , tom@@ atoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry to the West since its reaction was to tried to take power over a weak response .
&quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the sn@@ ail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ pi@@ ers to pull off the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian state @-@ ef win in Ankara with certainty a bonus for it , that he called for the tried cou@@ p @-@ rich support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , self @-@ compreh@@ en@@ sible , which has itself a deep @-@ sitting fear of regime . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this splendid palace close to the sea , made it Russia and Turkey , one like it was once described an analy@@ st , &quot; Alliance of external side &quot; : two countries that come across from west and treat poor@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two still . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently presented the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey left oppos@@ ing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be pun@@ ished , that after almost three hours at first talks , both Presi@@ dents at the press conference told that they had not yet att@@ ained the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey would like to answer a question about their differences , while Putin chose to empha@@ size it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ ominator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in light of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO member of Turkey the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State was at least once again talk . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the r@@ bs is to be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the stand@@ ardis@@ ed head of the Bank to a back@@ office .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
R@@ oss Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland with that the brand were r@@ bs associated with global am@@ bitions of the bank .
the Bank has since been stand@@ off@@ ish since she was almost k@@ oll@@ ed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; during this time , trademark &quot; r@@ bs &quot; &quot; used to protect other consumers . &quot;
&quot; you supported the international sport with millions of pounds to sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to put more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the IP@@ O will change to Natural West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the business to become more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Drum@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during an sightseeing tour of customers and employees in Inver@@ ness @-@ Sh@@ ire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become one of our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand , as well as to the brand that our employees will be busy since we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank has become a global brand , it became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue any global objectives , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these marks will be completely different in their own con@@ greg@@ ations for something completely different and our employees will work under these marks .
&quot; K@@ osta has already said that there will be its six Nations Sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the perception of various brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of the brand , because how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the pioneer . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very Cypri@@ ot three years ago , when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and we had to expand these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches the Pre@@ dil@@ ection of its 3,@@ 000@@ m gain in New@@ market

&quot; the dre@@ ad winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who has won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family also here is
&quot; I am very happy that it is done at New@@ market , because I am late 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ c Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the itch to win the victory as he will get the victory for pre@@ dil@@ ection
&quot; two jo@@ cke@@ ys reached the milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ck@@ ey Richard Johnson and the reti@@ red 20 @-@ pa@@ ige winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 vict@@ ories in a recur@@ ring career . &quot;
L@@ ester pig@@ gh@@ t the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4.@@ 493 Car@@ rier@@ esi@@ sts
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ck@@ ey of the moder@@ nity and it is not a surprise that he achieved this milestone only a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical int@@ ell@@ ect that diff@@ ers from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
he is a fantastic amb@@ assador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ is@@ ma enthusiastic fans since years for this sport . &quot;
I said Frank@@ ie just a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already fet@@ ched up 6.000 Win if he was not just a weekend and grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ jo@@ ck@@ ey !
Frank@@ ie has already suffered for nearly 30 years already in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , what is good for a bri@@ tish race but in addition he is an unbeliev@@ able jo@@ ck@@ ey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British flat since two decades . &quot;
it was ner@@ ve @-@ wr@@ acking .

&quot; and he is far from the end of - D@@ ett@@ ori used to be said before , that he wants to continue with competitions until at least 50.@@ ten years of life . &quot;
Russia Putin Hum@@ ert Stab@@ ili@@ ef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly released its administrative reef Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was a lot of years part of the stal@@ lion of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special representative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dism@@ iss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s by his duties as chairman of the Russian presi@@ ding administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was dep@@ uty since 2012 Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 1972 born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn , he made his conclusion on the renowned state of Moscow International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy of Tokyo . &quot;
on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was written for the director and the director of the Govern@@ or .
&quot; on his appointment he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as state authority and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin divided the Russian TV Channel on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov therefore asked to leave his post and recommended v@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
to convince the ridicul@@ ous faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was a long time of one of the most eng@@ ages Vladimir Putin , and works as he works for the Soviet Intelligence , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as the Stab@@ ili@@ zer he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on TV , maintained both men that the Stab@@ ili@@ ation occurs on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are only few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggles ?
this is currently no one .
&quot; but the official alleg@@ ation - that a man who was once a potential president , which would lead to once again the Russian environmental policy - came across great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who are quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , said Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated post in 2012 - you could almost say - compl@@ aining about four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been Chairman of the Russian presi@@ ding board for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence .

&quot; in the late 1990s , as Putin appointed chairman of the Federal Security Council ( F@@ SB ) , which was established by the K@@ GB , was appointed Ivan@@ ov to his de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have linked the Nord@@ deck of Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means the bridge is now connected with fiber@@ glass .
&quot; it is the first of four clo@@ cks of the &quot; &quot; cover blas@@ ph@@ s &quot; , &quot; which approach to each of the three towers of the bridge each of the three towers . &quot;
the Br@@ ining section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20.000 tons of concrete , and 46 sl@@ itters . &quot;
the £ 1,35 billion project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Epi@@ st@@ ini@@ ster K@@ eit@@ h Brown started building a visit today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbo@@ lic moment when building the Queens@@ ferry cross@@ ings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering experience of a truly ep@@ ic measure of this project with over 30.000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the verse between the Vi@@ a@@ duct and the Br@@ ück@@ er &apos;s activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total ende@@ aring at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , Project manager of For@@ th Cross@@ ing Bridge Con@@ struct@@ ors said : &quot; the first verse represents a significant milestone in each bri@@ dging project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the sh@@ utter @-@ setting high and low @-@ building represents .
&quot; after the installation of the last tram section and its connection with the expansion of the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to finish the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by drag@@ ging the northern states of 700 millimeters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very hei@@ ght@@ ened activity .
&quot; massive since the vi@@ a@@ du@@ cts 222 meters long is , ca . 6@@ ,000 tons weighs and with a incl@@ ine of approximately 3 % had to be drawn up . &quot;
&quot; hei@@ ght@@ ened , because the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , tiny - on each side they prayed only a few millimeters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
salvation in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; happiness still alive &quot; after they were thrown off from her fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station opened on Friday at 13 : 20 B@@ ST alarm after a crew was watching the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat moved out of their own power . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat felt near around itself , and set us the worst before , &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used by boat already except its range until we left to water , he added . &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man spent at the age of 60 and was found at a bu@@ ck without b@@ ail@@ b@@ ust .
they all arrived on board the coast @-@ bo@@ ots and were brought back to the lif@@ ebo@@ at station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water , happiness are un@@ happy and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor is more than a stop@@ pl@@ one , however , these proceeds from the te@@ ar of the board of the person off the boat . &quot;
someone has w@@ ailed over these men today .
difficult to hurt - man sti@@ ff to his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and hard to hurt .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old came the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of the abuse of the clothes of his ex @-@ friend .
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he came twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was wo@@ unded at hand and in the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ arm@@ oured of his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went with her lifestyle from the house .
on the road they met the ex @-@ habitats of the male .
&quot; when the two women betra@@ yed the apartment again , sh@@ ub@@ est of the 50 @-@ year @-@ old his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who builds brown @-@ wel@@ ve cheap apartments ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and Green mean : investors are supposed to be much stronger in the duty in future . &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD pro@@ poses a &quot; action plan living . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , dispute is programmed . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the favourable apartments ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; President Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we are saying with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build us with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas , in future , 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the favorable apartments can also be found in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute in the city hall be , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you go with investors to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such areas at least 10 percent , but as possible as to build up as 20 per cent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing project , which will cost the millions of cost and must be financed and must be financed for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the groups . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left will still need hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of its , so Brat@@ mann , ba@@ the a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the market . &quot;
&quot; the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the forces .
&quot; but the program is not entirely different : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but how do you get loss of more about 1300 apartments from which funding will be running in the coming years ?
there will be 500 apartments by 2020 alone .
&quot; to prevent this , the plan@@ ing speaker of Nicole Palm , should now be purchased out of the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be noted , apartments again to get back to the price connection . &quot;
this is possible in the west town .
at one fell sw@@ oop to solve the problem .
in the west town are running for the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments we could get back in the price @-@ binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : this want the owners , the housing companies do not want . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the west town is dr@@ as@@ tically dramatically , one removed from the objective of so @-@ called inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot;
a concentration of social @-@ weak in just a few city parts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens therefore expect that there will be a movement in the discussion .
&quot; Group Leader of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a wide majority , the CD@@ U must be connected to the boat . &quot;
they have concentrated on more buildings for family @-@ family buildings .
but what does not mean that not yet another compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage boys and child to play no longer go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time on screens , was indi@@ cted in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa to get and active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was at the beginning on the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and activities open not to each other .
&quot; I &apos;m of course based on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that were built on the characters first , which were first created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ern ( later , a carto@@ ons , cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop @-@ culture , the interest in front of the game published in the USA , Australia and New Zealand early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ load the server .
within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go has more users as ink and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone out and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who have been trac@@ ed with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; taken &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sp@@ rang up for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person back every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ og@@ ram , an app for Apple Watch , the 35@@ ,000 users re@@ per@@ sec@@ uted , divided the Washington Post recently with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of trac@@ eability folks that train every day 30 minutes by 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays in Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it is only the raw data for performance improvement .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; every day to be active &quot; &quot; sti@@ rs on de@@ be ears , because many public messages are boring and of people come to look . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who drives regularly sports , reduces its chances to keep on cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to address them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; however , there is also m@@ ashed toys who always have to complain about something . &quot;
and yes one could walk against a door .
what should I do ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; although smartphone apps , such as Fit@@ bit has already been able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it is doing this game . &quot;
the new will lose its maturity and use it with time .
&quot; however , because of poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the assets in the real world and to help with many people on hunting , active , f@@ itter and health@@ ier . &quot;

the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to multi@@ purpose tracks and increased the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly in front of the Silver medal and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ er@@ k@@ amer@@ adin A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bron@@ cem@@ e@@ da@@ geh@@ ter Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es were burned on the flo@@ ck @-@ beam during the course of the multi @-@ conflict during the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin , which wins a multi@@ purpose title and total the fifth , while they soli@@ di@@ fy its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in te@@ ars when their final result was shown and her long journey at this moment was an end .
this success puts it in the same le@@ ague as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who have brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years its sports medals , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , making a mixture of am@@ bition and precision , that the Olympi@@ ast@@ eg@@ ist from 1984 Mary Lou rescue on by her she said &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast I ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to be a last review in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not return with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas back , would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;

&quot; although Bil@@ es consi@@ sted , during their long way@@ points to the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
&quot; a part of their floor exercises , which included their typical tum@@ bling pass - is adapted to Latin American music , which would be at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ ast@@ arena in Rio . &quot;
this is not a coinci@@ dence .

&quot; it has lost no extra competition since the summer of 2013 , a vict@@ orious series , which will hold as long as it wishes Bil@@ es . &quot;

police : 3 victims in serial fall in case of music sc@@ oring in the car
&quot; according to the police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most de@@ adly attacks for a decade in the first series of mass murder , while they stopped in the car and list@@ ened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a driv@@ eway , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator eight shots from a hand@@ fire @-@ monkey while he stood on the side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the thir@@ st murder does not seem to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ast@@ le , since the att@@ acker did not participate the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who found themselves in possession of an adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting , investig@@ ating a closer look at whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; overall , predomin@@ antly in h@@ isp@@ anic resi@@ des were killed in nine months in nine months and two others were wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , divided Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of CB@@ S , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects several vehicles has used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s or a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators provide the evidence of expression that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness divided the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the thir@@ sty murder , and from that it came out , that it was the work of the serial line . &quot;
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age and safe a ball from the seat as well as ball frag@@ ments from the motor room .

&quot; when he came home the first time was my first thought , I did not do that . &quot;
I do not do that .
I did not let me go .
&quot; what is not true -- of course , one has turned out to it &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund she can never recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they sm@@ ashed him to institu@@ tion@@ alize .
&quot; my first response was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a sal@@ ary .
Ed@@ mund could not sit down to his third year and he still cannot speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run with support and drive cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , the Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; Please tell me something before &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing with &quot; , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to CB@@ S News . &quot;
but there is no typical drawing language -- tells them . Ed@@ mund has inv@@ ented some characters alone .
Micro@@ c@@ ie has a large number of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as masks or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .

&quot; it is still too early to say , as it will affect the life of with the Z@@ ik@@ avi@@ rus In@@ infected . &quot;

what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know it .

&quot; the grand@@ parents gave rise to that Brown had gone several barriers , including in the L@@ ens , B@@ ein , arm and belly , but that he was in his transportation to the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was pier@@ ced by balls , divided his grand@@ mother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ id@@ z the sender . &quot;
I cannot believe that .
the state of the boy was more critical in a hospital and had to under@@ go several surgery .
the family of the boy divided the transmitter with that he is ref@@ used again .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in Germ@@ an@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were killed : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ old men is in the critical state ; the other two victims are loud CB@@ S Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was located on the front seat of a car along with 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , an@@ cho@@ red , reported the sender . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and police are determined precisely whether under one of the last men of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors could be of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors .
investig@@ ators shared CB@@ S Philadelphia with that apparently it seems to be a cross @-@ fire between several shooter .
&quot; cartridge sle@@ eves for pet@@ ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed to different assault ri@@ ots , over@@ se@@ wn the Tat@@ a . &quot;
it seems that it has been clearly tr@@ aded to a long term struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walk , we found d@@ ül@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters here , which were very active involved , divided the police ne@@ at@@ eu@@ p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di police in Philadelphia the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and cars met in the area .
&quot; it came to no strongh@@ old , and the police are currently reviewed according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year girl met by a cross@@ r@@ ack@@ et at the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West Oak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie needs
that is what I present to me under the women &apos;s role in the Tur@@ n of Tur@@ n and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been doing so since 1984 with every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three tur@@ ner , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which was inspir@@ ational for many young girls of other skin @-@ color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lic@@ in is , round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has paved the black and h@@ isp@@ anic feminine presence at the head of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female tur@@ ner@@ ve was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising ol@@ ag@@ ew@@ inner and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to be a witness of the unbeliev@@ able performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tically routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone the fourth , hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin was awarded with an individual multi@@ purpose event for women Gold . &quot;
Mann@@ ing member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won Silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but you do not see dental classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie swal@@ low@@ ed all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ ess will have only four turbines in the crew . moreover , that is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ n is a expensive sport and g@@ ymn@@ asts are primarily in private turn@@ tables , who will be maintained by parents who will cost competitive and hotel cost ( for the trainers and their turbines and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these verses , the tur@@ ner receive their overall training and that is for families a expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the con@@ greg@@ ations of countless , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a affor@@ ded and easier to accessible trainers . &quot;
I founded my rotation of 20 years .
&quot; with my events we have free and affordable tur@@ fs in Harlem for more than 15@@ ,000 urban people ( above all black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) offered and national and international winner . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high quality Tur@@ n who earn the opportunity to learn from this great ol@@ ymp@@ ic sport .
&quot; turbine develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health and educational and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ ns and that is great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this true representation of &quot; &quot; girl Power &quot; &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the ol@@ ymp@@ ic Mann@@ er@@ gol@@ ds and thank you who motiv@@ ates their way to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance agencies want to organize another strike , after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ting proposal . &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistance systems , who vote on a choice when choosing him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt have revealed plans to introduce the Treaty to enter into a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; that the N@@ HS would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract which contains changes to night@@ - and week@@ end@@ ings to improve the care of unbeliev@@ able c@@ lock@@ times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chair@@ woman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assi@@ stance practi@@ tioners have shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants have agreed to the proposed treaty , in particular that it will treat the current availability crisis and it is admini@@ stered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks , who still remain until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract must be made progress and the time goes out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A solution to the solution of dispute through talks during the government will take part in the ref@@ us@@ ement and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to the speaking of a promise , Jerem@@ y Hunt had only done last month about that his door would ever be open . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Hunt must now act now to raise the pre@@ condition and concerns the concerns of the assist@@ ants .
&quot; he should not do this , so it has made the assistance systems clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a record of almost 13@@ ,000 routine oper@@ ations and 100.000 Term@@ ines before , since n@@ urses and specialists were included in order to give physicians to the Stri@@ k@@ post@@ cards decoder . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the reform@@ ist contract with the functioning of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to give a better week @-@ idea for the 54@@ ,000 assistance specialists , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , called the assistance systems to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said , &quot; labour measures achieve nothing but little but already loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , nursing and their families just worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
in the last two months we talked to the team of assistance specialists and with the health of assistance as well as other mini@@ stries .
&quot; the employers hop@@ ed that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as dischar@@ ged , flexibility in training , additional training for those looking for a vocational training period , continuing education , training , health Education England and the Health Department to comply with agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day medicine can reduce the heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart inf@@ ants will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , having been recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the anti @-@ mat@@ ory medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of re@@ peti@@ tive heart infections for people with a disease disease .
&quot; the medication is admini@@ stered by a heart attack by 12 months , thus reducing the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Authority of the N@@ HS has been advised for a period of four years to keep the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator Authority of the N@@ HS has been advised for a period of four years to keep the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; some 140,000 people suffer a heart attack and a quarter of it suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart inf@@ ect and stroke will be caused by collections , fatty material in the arter@@ ies walls , the si@@ ves form . &quot;
&quot; when the si@@ ag breaks apart , it may cause a blood @-@ inn@@ erm@@ ination to pet@@ ri@@ ft the blood flow up to the heart and thereby caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood flow solved , it can flow through the blo@@ od@@ stream and blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
persons who had already had a heart attack on a higher risk to have another risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ in@@ eca which is distributed by the British company A@@ stra@@ in@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood @-@ inn@@ ed im@@ meas@@ urable . &quot;
&quot; device &apos;s approach is published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the Student Health @-@ assessment Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , another heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ ous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart disease can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively at the reduction of further heart inf@@ ants and stroke will be with people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to expand the treatments available to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - above all the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the attack is not recommended for treatment that desc@@ ends over this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ness can flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
the former may@@ or of Tower Ham@@ s. Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dism@@ iss@@ al of a government &apos;s report on corruption
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ess has led to the widespread election in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored as a destroyed government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es g@@ access@@ es the police , elect@@ oral and Rath@@ en@@ dings to have ignored the evidence of elect@@ oral abuse on eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an Ant@@ abuse of voters from religious motives so badly , that it should be allowed to al@@ ign deport@@ ations out of elect@@ oral p@@ ines out of elect@@ oral voters to protect voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a reference with their identity in order to prove their identity .
&quot; at the moment , a voters must only call its name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink to the finger of a person when they give up their choices to prevent that someone is chosen twice . &quot;
whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls that the press should have more access to common conditions and decisions of not official sessions or work@@ groups .
&quot; this not only serves against the election of elect@@ oral , but also the municipal government should also protect against the wider audience , and financial bet@@ rug@@ ated culture that goes with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ s. elect@@ oral sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special Tribunal that the am@@ oral may@@ or of Lut@@ fur for Rah@@ man should be corru@@ pt to corru@@ pt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man would per@@ su@@ ade the religious feelings of his Muslim community , &quot; and that he had brought his critics to se@@ gregation with se@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ opho@@ bia to the silence . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ man is supposed to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the reli@@ ant duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful , or the result of a im@@ itation , when one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric told that there were all the land evidence of sc@@ ams in the whole country .
&quot; it vo@@ iced particularly al@@ ar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent stamp - when the older members of the Muslim Community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to feed the elect@@ oral system , including filling out to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it is said : &quot; &quot; as proof was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some eth@@ ni@@ cal minorities was exercis@@ ed , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of the Elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ dic or ban@@ glad@@ ian background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; over@@ sensitivity to ethnic and religion would be ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric talked to 50 recommendations in order to feed the system , including the prohibition that political acti@@ vi@@ sts must be sub@@ ordin@@ ate to stop &quot; &quot; choices &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , does not require tough@@ er registration tests to prevent that the elect@@ oral system is used to imp@@ mig@@ r@@ ation and social bet@@ ational purposes . &quot;
consider voters before the election according to your reference .
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they have given their voice to prevent that someone is chosen twice . &quot;
systematic inspec@@ tions about the nationality of a person will carry out to ensure that they are entitled to either .
a three @-@ year limitation to requests to an automatic po@@ stage choice .
ban that political acti@@ vi@@ sts complete envelop@@ e and envelop@@ es of stamp .
the police give the authority to set up waste .
a legislative change that facilit@@ ates an indi@@ ct@@ ment for in@@ tim@@ id@@ ation according to the Re@@ presentation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) .
photographers in elect@@ rop@@ es .
requirement that only English can be used in the elect@@ rop@@ es ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , to ensure that the employees rule the rule that voters go alone into the elect@@ oral person . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and it finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ ny case not have been ques@@ tioned . &quot;
&quot; the elect@@ oral court has declared Rah@@ man and his de@@ pu@@ ties to corru@@ pt it on the basis of a response to corru@@ pt and illegal practices than un@@ ques@@ tion@@ able , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for adequate , according to the str@@ ingent requirements in the criminal proceedings - not guilty . &quot;
he also cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the most effective &quot; Ab@@ h@@ ak@@ al controls &quot; of the V@@ alls of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the J@@ urisdi@@ ction in Tower Ham@@ s. from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is contributing to the mother of parliam@@ ents a proud heritage , but wor@@ rying and conce@@ aled some of the authorities threat@@ ening this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympic sol@@ en@@ ik@@ in is far from the only one to fight gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous double @-@ lon@@ er - at least not , if you can give the social media belief . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ ours of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fle@@ e at time on our screens , F@@ EM@@ AI@@ L has created a lists of Olympi@@ ast@@ ering , which have more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Holl@@ y@@ den &apos;s most famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team at Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; apart from the semi @-@ detached house on the Rad@@ r@@ enn@@ ing , many people go to the internet to how to be a certain arch@@ ery of the Zw@@ illing of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team at Archery Br@@ ady Ell@@ ison has caused a crash on Twitter , after pictures on which he looks similar to the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ery given the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to that he has been hearing from his childhood since he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity with the exception of the fac@@ ial hair , divided Br@@ ady the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a casual guy , so I feel that as ac@@ compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into the center : the dis@@ integrating simil@@ arity between the British Weit@@ br@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ner@@ ine Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eye is to go through the Cub@@ an American singer for the Cub@@ an @-@ American singer in Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swim@@ mer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
&quot; a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Coaching &quot;
another decent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael N@@ ada@@ l and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett was that similar to heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver medal cl@@ ill@@ ings in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points more than just the sun @-@ colored skin and blonde hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ Cor@@ d , while the American Nathan Adrian was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar fac@@ ial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others are the simil@@ arities too .
theory placed in the space : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple or perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; a Twitter User@@ in explained their satisfaction , that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter nearly identical . &quot;

&quot; we regret it right that these statements were made and that it was made possible , that they will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
we spent last night quickly with our spect@@ ators on shipment and our followers in social media .
&quot; to make one clear , Byr@@ on &apos;s comments are related to the performance of swimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ adequate and a un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byr@@ on does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justi@@ fy his re@@ mark by trying to justi@@ fy that it was not his intention that she is designed as a personal attack . &quot;

buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ trag@@ ed about woman who tasted in the middle of business
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman moved their clothes in the midst of an pri@@ mark to try under@@ p@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , mu@@ stered her , as she saw in it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of lower in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny David@@ son who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried to underwear , &quot; they left again and leave the shop without having something to buy . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the vessel , she took a couple under@@ p@@ ants from the fore@@ ground , moved their own pen@@ ises and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; they did not even tried a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - it just stood there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; every rigid , when she pul@@ led back the under@@ p@@ ants that you obviously did not like , since they lay them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she re@@ peti@@ te the same with three more under@@ p@@ ants before they finally decided that her nothing fell , turned down again and out . &quot;
&quot; she seemed not to disturb@@ ing that she was watching someone up - or about the person who would buy the sub@@ contractors , who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Ms. David@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said , &quot; &quot; How to think , that somebody would take shelter with home , which had another person and that were not washed away . &quot;
the inci@@ dent took on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. David@@ son added : &quot; &quot; how I got to get , the staff tries to pull the clothing from the sale , after they went - what is just as good . &quot;

how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a against ce@@ ase@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safe for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to get around with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; if one turn to you from behind , then you should see themselves as a first step , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the scar@@ let line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
gra@@ b the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free Ell@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the bar and twi@@ sting you while the spru@@ ce in front of pain collap@@ ses , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the running into the face and move back , while they set the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with att@@ ackers who approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the circuit line , gra@@ b the weapon and twi@@ sting them , so the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move back and set the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?

trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide @-@ book his tongue at the dirty @-@ most places in Europe
a bri@@ tish travel under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex by a serious test - by taking some of the most lubric@@ ation and ek@@ el@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Suff@@ olk , his course on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ c@@ adi@@ l@@ ly Circus , a dishwasher of a draw toil@@ ette as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resi@@ li@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the check @-@ out every object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ous to show up and show us what he will leave . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment that was fil@@ med under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the flus@@ hing of a draw toil@@ ette , which was already used by thousands of others , may really be rep@@ ul@@ sive , but actually are in a kitchen sp@@ inning more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to physicians and medical specialists about the support of intest@@ ine bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he p@@ ines , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right has been known for testing the resi@@ li@@ ence of his intest@@ ine by te@@ asing it through the world and ate , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to dish@@ wash@@ es of toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample
&quot; he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerns and I put all the possible things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was given his reputation in any case .
the only thing he re@@ able@@ ed was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ ver@@ ab@@ ed showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number of over 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison with this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ isation is expected to be less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he escap@@ ed himself , after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ eter@@ number over 4000 units was , while fresh@@ ly adjusted hands one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ ile &quot; &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; this comes the worst , what I had in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
&quot; I will see nothing here , because it is here inside . &quot;
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company is our Lord W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which provides both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intest@@ ine bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ dity Senior Venice President for snacks , ju@@ ices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says , &quot; &quot; we wanted the consumer really something new to offer . &quot;
something that &apos;s intri@@ gu@@ ing to the sight and at the same time explain the benefits of pro@@ biot@@ ics .
&quot; we led crazy Bra@@ in@@ stor@@ m@@ ings by that so that we said , &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intest@@ inal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intest@@ inal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intest@@ inal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of hum@@ our !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , which led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , when he had made my respect for Ian that I have loved him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ous Russian toilet , which will be shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things that it was sim@@ pler to bring Ian to bringing them , and others , where this was pretty difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty le@@ wer@@ ies on film .
&quot; in one of validation conducted survey from the year 2015 affiliated 84 percent of all respon@@ sive military bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products , the attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys from Del@@ o@@ gi@@ al Social @-@ Apartment in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ cial family left their social @-@ home after a delay of £ 50@@ ,000 because it had sla@@ in their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were throwing after a long list of complaints from their estate in Sal@@ t@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were rolled away from their estate , and we found the property in a ir@@ rep@@ air@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were s@@ aff@@ able holes on wood floors , rub@@ b@@ ish were disp@@ ers@@ ed on the floor and gr@@ aff@@ iti was ador@@ ned to the walls . &quot;
the family were re@@ minded and it is believed that they now lives in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the management at Corn@@ wall Housing , said that she is not afraid that the apartment was no longer rep@@ aired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was for the people here an absolute night@@ mare and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be considered not as beautiful as Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is rep@@ aired and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror was added to the terror that the family had added , street children , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive cry , streams and flo@@ ods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement of anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be dem@@ ol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found . &quot;
&quot; they were tr@@ aded in the estate , in which in the past drugs were tr@@ acked out , the wood@@ di@@ ppers &quot;
neighbours said that they had to fight them on the street and had to inv@@ oked the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall Housing del@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ gi@@ o@@ ed her and her partner this week at the property after they gave them a prolon@@ ged period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
&quot; Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation were che@@ ered by light@@ ened neighbors , which spoke that their lives was made to hell . &quot;
one said off : &quot; they d@@ ressed itself to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was here so quiet - that we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally away , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , neigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall Housing , said that it was admini@@ stered the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house to which the police was launched in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the covered side of the community @-@ house were buried in tr@@ ash and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that there is the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behavior and the family , since a delay is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall Housing is taking into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all of the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community , who are looking forward to us and have given us the information made . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development is coming to a few neighbours tro@@ dden , and the message con@@ veys that anti@@ social behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all be over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police led a raid in the house and found about 70@@ G cannabis as well as sc@@ ales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a bank@@ ment after they had guilty of the owner of a drug class B in merch@@ ant views .
&quot; they maintained that the money for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who came in 2013 with an auto@@ inf@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after they were without ob@@ da@@ ch , that T@@ anya and her partner is now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were made with gr@@ aff@@ iti .
police says that they are ten@@ ant who will not hold on the stat@@ utes .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall divided with that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation had a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not hold the stat@@ utes .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can do without self @-@ sp@@ ass , as well as those who have been damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and anti@@ social behavior to continue working with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; because of the tough pre@@ h@@ ens of the Turkish president Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an after the cou@@ p , the Kur@@ dish village expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short notice , I reck@@ on with ten thousand of thousands of seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany when the Erd@@ og@@ an regime fought the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government crossed over months after months of cur@@ tail@@ ing with criminal actions , be 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the put@@ ted cou@@ ms are still sec@@ ular and op@@ position@@ ists ethnic Turks .
many will start in Europe new if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state who re@@ ign@@ ed for refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ ania comp@@ lied by the targeted ana@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arab and in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erd@@ og@@ an to the qualifying pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds will increase . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been exhausted or displ@@ aced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; the Verb@@ ania ur@@ ged that the federal government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erd@@ og@@ an and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; wit@@ ch@@ hunting &quot; against Erd@@ og@@ an Cri@@ tics .
I do not feel more safe in Germany in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks .
&quot; for more Turks , asylum in Germany are searching for , especially Kur@@ ds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len is destroyed teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and ground@@ ed , sitting on packed caffeine , by the way the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ari@@ sts , said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Stiftung Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reported on appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks put the Turks at the put@@ sch the largest group which fought for political persecution of recognised as@@ par@@ ans in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June 30 , the 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all as as@@ yl acknowledged ( 39.@@ 625 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they are not found before war , poverty or perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , so from state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art page , individually followed . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; then go where it we@@ ht@@ ut &quot;
&quot; strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer &apos;s campaign with - and the holiday makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they have understood .
2021 will not resume the day @-@ during election directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for little as far as far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ sw@@ ap@@ ers - that is attached . &quot;
locals that are to be convinced by the voting fighters are on vacation .
&quot; the owners who are in the country are , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so do not choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; they come practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters stick@@ ers , bal@@ lo@@ ons , leaf@@ s , fl@@ yers and in the end of the voices , just consume . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the elect@@ oral and last Fer@@ i@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must pass over to the people over @-@ Vorpommern once more over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , now lies in surveys clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thr@@ illing is how strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the ex@@ changing dust .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Govern@@ sch@@ ef , making an almost un@@ noticeable election campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ aster a little with the people , as it has already been his legendary @-@ kar@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , soul will get cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame at the bl@@ os@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refuge@@ e policy , you &quot; We create that &quot; have acceler@@ ated the climb of the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful ministry now . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U with their cat@@ ap@@ an@@ di@@ data , the Minister Minister Lorenz Caf@@ fier , has already experienced as it is when you make the wrong time at the right place voting . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to grand@@ parents : Merkel Bun@@ dest@@ ag@@ sw@@ ung lies in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group was not agreed , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg &apos;s and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , called Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is too bad to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , even Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the North @-@ CD@@ U comp@@ ressed largely to the usual choices on market spaces and in front of shopping centres with umbre@@ llas and bal@@ lo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so does co@@ ert , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noticed that you must im@@ itate on the land the base that they must be very vulnerable , again a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are just like the Left , the SPD , the Green : there is hardly any way in the breadth of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U @-@ election co@@ ert to his fellow @-@ dispute , however , is also self @-@ reli@@ eved : &quot; &quot; they must go then where there is we@@ ht@@ ut , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Gol@@ dene weddings , every Birth@@ day party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last up to 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won over the CD@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , thir@@ st the lea@@ p into the land . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holidays @-@ need a modern virtu@@ e and embarrass@@ ed its election campaign in the internet .
&quot; online @-@ Elec@@ tions , &quot; it is called the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the green elect@@ or@@ ti@@ sts find on Sp@@ ur@@ en@@ search for native stim@@ uli among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the sp@@ ass plat@@ inum , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ burg@@ se lakes and also finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; Leg@@ acy in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ renovation : restaurants are suffering from blo@@ cking
&quot; to the speed , with which the B 27 is built , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the buil@@ ders , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and only until 8 p.m. , there is all@@ enth@@ used praise . &quot;
&quot; they made all pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no reference .
the job@@ site could be moved to the South at the beginning of the half @-@ time until the end of October shall all be ready .
&quot; also , the dec@@ ors of those responsible for civil work is responsible , approximately if it comes to setting up residence trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south is w@@ ander@@ ed and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and therefore the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , has changed the traffic situation inside the place . &quot;
the citizens can now run from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 back to the side .
the alternative traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly significant complaints , &quot; says the responsible management of the renovation management of the Ministry of Economics Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ rat@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many vulner@@ abilities were looking and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that man@@ cher truck in residential area is dec@@ ayed .
&quot; as well as the speed limitation has not been respected , the municipality has reinforced the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable crossing , &quot; says King , who made himself on location on the location . &quot;
there have been dr@@ illed two to three per minute .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 minutes of kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 @-@ area .
&quot; since the construction site , it has become quiet . &quot;
for business@@ men at B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg is now open the road again .
we don &apos;t like to have a look at the cards of business@@ men .
&quot; but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to them at revenue streams , everybody lets you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some are some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; so for other companies , for which there is hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Ma@@ ier , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most light decline , &quot; but also a course that of course the career is missing . &quot;
most exploited are the locations along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , former crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ent .
&quot; not only him , but all of the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; it lack@@ ed customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad about each euro turnover .
&quot; the VAT sh@@ red@@ ded it on &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the stre@@ et@@ ment have been with@@ drawn up to two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would be released , the policy could react differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Govern@@ mental President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öhn@@ er to whether there is a financial compensation , with the reference to the location on the B 27 Now they also have the dis@@ advantages that arise through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öhn@@ er knows of other land@@ routes , where something more spacious . &quot;
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his hospitality will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled already since 1715 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular passenger now is less common due to complicated traffic performance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one can not go down , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; that its stem kli@@ fts after the end of the refurb@@ ishment work again , he has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with B@@ SE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its customers for the greatest crisis that has experienced his hospitality in its long standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of constructions , this is already brut@@ al . &quot;
constantly under the name of counter @-@ terrorism in the name of the terrorist attack .
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister of Defense de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is now a thick@@ er security package . &quot;
but what has a sad status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ ation say to all that ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Com@@ promis@@ ers .
&quot; all its proposals be deemed to be the ko@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist &quot; politically and reason@@ ably , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the introduction of his new vulner@@ ability . &quot;
they do not request anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
they also participate in it .
&quot; but the Minister of Ministers , he is located in the results and at a &quot; &quot; spati@@ al consensus &quot; &quot; within the Co@@ alition . &quot;
&quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , returned after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach a little time before he presents his conclusions for the security in the Republic . &quot;
but the fall for this but therefore the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , un@@ aware : that a new security authority is to take care of the cr@@ ack encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to apply several EU specifications to flight data and ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is likewise not surprising .
&quot; to part starts de Ma@@ izi@@ ère a second run for suggestions , which has not been working with the SPD to so far : he wants to put sympathy for the terrorist groups among punishment and hin@@ ge ji@@ ha@@ dist@@ s with double citizenship by the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still consider it for reasonable and demands nothing that I have no chances when co@@ ali@@ als . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also .
&quot; in part , they have partially in itself : he is planning quick procedure for deport@@ ations and more possibilities to inhi@@ bit@@ ing people from deport@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; refugees who are specifically fet@@ ched into the country , should advance their smartphone vi@@ als and reveal social media accounts for a security inspection . &quot;
&quot; if cancelled for sc@@ ul@@ sion asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to hold some worse than so far - such that criminal off@@ ences are going to go or create their papers in order to wear their identity . &quot;
a lot of it is politically and legally sacred .
man@@ ches also affects un@@ balanced and leaves issues open .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of memorial , for example - is the question : what does this actually have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be expressed in speech that the attacks was of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people have worried about the high degree of refuge@@ e concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that have deeply busy people , now they were not le@@ ased down in elect@@ oral times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the f@@ use is great .
and yes there are elect@@ oral struggles .
the Union and the SPD can therefore increasingly bring about internal security in a position .
in the past days there were high two parties in the past few days .
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ er dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then about an security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons of ministers , in which the R@@ ess@@ ort@@ chiefs also calls for a Bur@@ ka ban and a revers@@ al of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also blo@@ oms here to be reconc@@ iled t@@ ints .
from a passing from the double @-@ pass it doesn &apos;t stop anything .
we have witness@@ ed the discussion in Germany .
they are new to re@@ locate is not useful .
and at a Bur@@ ka @-@ ban he put the constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional for all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the bo@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists , it has to appear yet . &quot;
there is a lot inside what could make a dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ gres@@ sing the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes only by careful talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improve security . &quot;
still Volkswagen gli@@ ding comes from .
&quot; despite diesel sk@@ and@@ als , the output will be charged around the world . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
in the return action there is no term for a term .
Volkswagen starts the second half @-@ year work together in the second half @-@ year .
Europe &apos;s largest high@@ lighting can continue in advance even despite the diesel production thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets further .
&quot; but in July weak@@ ened the nuclear brand VW primarily in Western Europe , and thus again the total selling , such as that in the D@@ ax not@@ ated company . &quot;
&quot; in the world , the brand @-@ selling brand VW in July with 449@@ 100 cars between 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the prior year months . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales up 14 percent below the previous year months . &quot;
in the home market Germany the equi@@ voc@@ ations around almost one hex@@ agon .
&quot; br@@ anding , Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ening numbers from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given to a few core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; a department store . &quot;
&quot; apart from the situation around the cou@@ p in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um continued to be charged for leaving the EU , and explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the car@@ bure@@ tor first escal@@ ate first , is also further a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house @-@ market of the Niedersachsen @-@ scan@@ dal is following gli@@ de due to the diesel scan@@ dal : after the first seven months is only a result of 0,@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles at be@@ ech . &quot;
Group sales representative Fred Kap@@ pler was able to forward a sales growth from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen at this time , 5.@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software subscription tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars for the conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the retro@@ fitting , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the change@@ over of the vehicles there are fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance . &quot;
&quot; the customer &apos;s duration of the customer after the refurb@@ ishment is a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in a corporate culture . &quot;
reason shall be legal enemies .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now yet a guarantee of ren@@ amed diesel models . &quot;
this would have been confirmed on the last Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Minister of Tourism .
the traffic of Commerce has been confirmed that this meeting was held .
&quot; VW has got to meet the conditions of my research Commission and the KBA full extent . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; &quot; declared federal government Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has adopted the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the conversion does not take place deteri@@ or@@ ations and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; Guarant@@ ee &quot; but not as it was in company travel .
&quot; under the wide term &quot; warranty &quot; Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come for example a half year after converting it to a workshop - and to return to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , it is important to avoid that it does not have any damage to any other damage , which does not have anything to deal with the wast@@ ew@@ ays of any warranty whatsoever , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am t@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich pig@@ lets in future pro@@ secution - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the German federation of German banks talks about a single case and doesn &apos;t see in it no signal : normal austerity &quot; would not fear , for their spar@@ se criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; camp banks money over night during the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay with 0,@@ 4 percent criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 Euro on tox@@ ins or daily monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 people will cost 400 Euros per year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has existed for 40 million euros , which could be lifted by one day on the other and which he could not be re@@ peti@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; that lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0,@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank &apos;s chef . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4000 Euro for each million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs shall follow in accordance with the service principle .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the Tres@@ ch of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have experienced four over@@ cases , I would not have the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank@@ note . &quot;
most of the clients would have understanding and alter@@ n@@ ally to other attacks .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the co@@ operative association of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing considerable costs at all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone carry , be &quot; business economically permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thür@@ inger Volks@@ - and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made headlines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect that individual clients have to pay for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a little bill@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if it is free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ founded co@@ operative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
in the region we live known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the Co@@ operative association Bayern &quot; are currently no further banks known to calculate an ex@@ position for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the thres@@ hold , to the neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
the competition is hard and it threat@@ ens the migration from investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be noticed in the width .
&quot; Dest@@ ination records : who are actually buy record plates , ? &quot;
lon@@ ely men of the middle age love records .
&quot; before you hur@@ ry to the commentary , in order to betra@@ y him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ aging men with rough exposure to so@@ oth@@ s , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v is the multi @-@ free trial of record , not on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the re@@ alism of physical objects but on Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently bought a record are all pre @-@ view at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des through Hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plat@@ ters reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % v@@ s. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % v@@ s. 66 % ) .
but vote the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while I keep in the midst of a busy road in Soho , a hum@@ ble an@@ ew and wild , before I stand up , my hands and tell something like : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let us take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart So@@ hos is slowly moving to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings , where the once independent seller were resident - there are still a hand@@ ful fantastic . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I set by Si@@ ster Ray ( data : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men of middle age , a woman , pres@@ um@@ ably for the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I wonder ?
&quot; I already cher@@ ish , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4@@ ,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed up at home ) to dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a substantial number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , when they appeared and again objects that he sold as he was young and ple@@ t . &quot;
&quot; many things I bought , are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I probably was something young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agre@@ es that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I drink not much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the medi@@ as@@ pe people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and let &apos;s see their old records again . &quot;
&quot; of the conversations that I have led , people usually have done so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their plates again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the B@@ oom of trailers of a record in a certain age .
but what about the in@@ adequate emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record shops has a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers took part in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound separ@@ ators , of objects , the happy youth @-@ inn@@ ero@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is as a collectors so I think it is so many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; k@@ ills a staff of a record @-@ stack .
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April un@@ veil@@ ed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player which they never use , while 7 % of those who bought a record , no record player . &quot;
at this time of the message report I would probably look very concerned while I for@@ got through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onny , 42 , who works in Sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men of the middle age ) has noticed a &quot; Trophy &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came just recently here and said : &quot; I do not have a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ head , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely going . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ las@@ z@@ able , less music @-@ cl@@ as@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; we have people , who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older who are only slowly coming . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted the record nearly a whole floor , has a b@@ lower audience than I set . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle age . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ standing shops , - Wild Be@@ fore , Syn@@ thesizer , pop , instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ill@@ ers from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
none of them looks lon@@ ely lon@@ ely lon@@ ely but nail psych@@ ic trau@@ mat@@ a are hard to concei@@ vable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds .
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the sale standing for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to make a man@@ or@@ um b@@ umb@@ le@@ bee as a large purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates cannot be a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way but the beauty of plates is ... they drive with a loving se@@ u@@ f@@ zer .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it is really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , by which is said that a new generation of record @-@ makers have been inspired : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the sunshine , the je@@ ans Hot@@ p@@ ants to patterns , watching a group of young teen@@ ager cameras , watching a father and daughter to buy a cross @-@ record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks like them - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to put them . &quot;
it is a pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury resi@@ stances such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my re@@ for@@ ger@@ ies agree that the results of You@@ Go@@ v votes , let them , at least in sheet @-@ shops in Soho , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ loving who exist in reality , ju@@ ices , and in Online@@ for@@ en , un@@ considered . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the B@@ um@@ ble by turn@@ around of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they prov@@ oke the rigid look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year wrong pres@@ enter , which infl@@ rag@@ ed over the shoulders of the middle age . &quot;

French Court and its offer on dem@@ oli@@ tion of shops in the jungle refuge@@ e camps
&quot; a French Court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , do@@ z@@ ens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; this week ar@@ gu@@ ed this week ar@@ gu@@ ed the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be fu@@ ged to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic business , in which individuals offer within the camp goods , selling cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais ar@@ gu@@ ed that these places should be lower , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and they hide a fire and refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court with that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state supported union and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accomodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a judgment in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the assignment of people who operate 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic business , but space that concerns the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a lot bigger role than just people to feed , who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Nieder@@ trav@@ sen was the vir@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is recognised and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on As@@ ylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 86@@ .000 people have signed the Peti@@ tion to maintain the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was that the closing &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , one of which are the youngest eight years old . &quot;
&quot; the two auxiliary organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants d@@ anced on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle will prevail over 9@@ 0,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep rise in Neu@@ ank@@ h@@ mm@@ lingen over the course of the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany R@@ aser to set off the next generation vel@@ ocity meters : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which should be very effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ uris@@ tic acting du@@ p trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example , in case of accidents , where it would be used for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or rolling bridges with temporary templates , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary bl@@ ater for adher@@ ing to the speed limit . &quot;
but a continuous creation can be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is autonomous : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , with laser technology , all vehicles can be detected at the same time via multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
variable speed constra@@ int as well as s@@ wor@@ ding bot@@ s to time , lanes and vehicle @-@ class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the high @-@ car state , one can move the trailer according to producers with any car with trailers . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to complain , it is lo@@ wer@@ ed in the brass , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mo@@ red and also disappear also shy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the blind@@ ness in front of Vand@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer are tested according to data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;

great Britain retri@@ eves silver in the 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain &apos;s 7 @-@ he Ru@@ g@@ by came on Thursday evening on Thursday evening to a abru@@ pt stop during the last hur@@ d@@ le in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were be@@ aten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the Dec@@ athlon stage here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji divided a master@@ class in the handling , side @-@ ste@@ pping , re@@ stores , scheduled run and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ame@@ da@@ ille of any color . &quot;
&quot; defeat was perf@@ ected by the non @-@ bad tro@@ phy of silver medal - Great Britain on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they sm@@ ote the New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the substantial defeat of the B@@ ats , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
but independent of which Fi@@ ji had be@@ aten a 15 @-@ man team in order form .
&quot; it could be for GB a tro@@ st - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck , Fi@@ j@@ is Che@@ f@@ trainer Ben Ryan , the former chef for England in Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind himself .
eight years ago she lost in Ryan of each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Se@@ v@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap will we@@ ar@@ un , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji was wonderful and let the attacks had fun off of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at , as if one would run into buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner r@@ ami@@ des . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes &quot; &quot; Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB can hardly be attached to the ball .
a devast@@ ating T@@ ackle from Mitchell stops the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate but it did Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua at the right corner has a touch @-@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa was added to a new since the revival and there was still over a minute play period ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u prec@@ eded by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ m@@ bled up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion took a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play , the 7 to play , while GB is still un@@ st@@ oned . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led to fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ vian gap ... for all four minutes , which was well done for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova to a brilliant stop@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long for favor of the southern isl@@ anders , whose fans fled away , flags , and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a Vi@@ li@@ ame set the i @-@ bag with an additional try in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ aving bow@@ ed , the fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced himself and GB c@@ ick@@ ed cr@@ ush in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the days Fi@@ ji Japan had defe@@ ated in the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and the UK , in a kn@@ itting half @-@ light match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the B@@ oks in the first half of the front , but Dan Norton burst the line with impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant tac@@ kling tac@@ kling Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , saf@@ est the gain - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ eres gold than with these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first ste@@ ch to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , found in the story , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in its golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if only those were those who were on the ruin , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she was at the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax @-@ woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sports , which laid on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 39.@@ er un@@ trained commitment , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de on the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ars , which is not reflected the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es to ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the Ru@@ ins there is a batt@@ ali@@ on on willi@@ ams which contribute to the incre@@ mental progress , which would not know the difference and it was nobody &apos;s assistant than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with him . &quot;
as he said he is what ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had Blas@@ orchester , who is operational and this they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather shy situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , begin what the inter@@ ruption held at a minimum if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back to me again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were lying . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the ren@@ dering itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ balance of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent a ner@@ ve @-@ off morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an application in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional w@@ rack . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repeatedly , how much me this means , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for train@@ ee or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to conclude there , st@@ anning and glo@@ ve had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let him te@@ ar .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking out to make some Tol@@ les .
&quot; today we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the couple will take for one year before it will make decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV @-@ Adventure Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have a lot of pressure .
&quot; in London it took about six months to grasp , that I am a Olympi@@ ant . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stress .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years long @-@ term for clarity of clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; Aqu@@ it@@ ator &quot; &quot; V@@ ick@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler , goes to retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; bay@@ ern@@ weit vor@@ tex . &quot;
a small fr@@ ench@@ ant drinking water association as a model for the great water producers .
&quot; thus , some time ago in the original ton was in a contribution of Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk . &quot;
little later the water@@ forum of the government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken was the tw@@ inning association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing group managed &quot; bay@@ ern@@ far as ex@@ empl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ per@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband Staff , it was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was reti@@ red at the age of 65 years at the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ endorf , municipality of Wi@@ err@@ brunn , promotes approximately 15@@ 0000 cu@@ bic meters of water and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member states are the municipalities of Kirch@@ l@@ ter , Breit@@ brunn , lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ sbach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current president , broad@@ casts of the may@@ or Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( F@@ W ) , re@@ minded that Ru@@ per@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler was employed in 1985 as a water @-@ wart and was appointed as Managing Director of the ken@@ nel association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks are very varied and they extend from the water@@ ing construction and maintenance work via office and organisational skills , the household simulation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency relief to weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re@@ integration of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the sub@@ missions of water @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to have any down@@ time and I have always added any new features , because water life is de@@ fi@@ red and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she pra@@ ised Gö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he worked with much heart blo@@ t for his water @-@ purpose association and he has lived the water @-@ purpose association and it would be his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he considered a true practi@@ tioners to present the successful concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group in front of the water@@ forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he received very much recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ per@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ anders pra@@ ised Al@@ f@@ ons Al@@ f@@ ons who have worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ ing and he was a loyal button .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlights from his point of view he describes the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the tw@@ ater .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult uses were the bur@@ gl@@ int at the peak in Kirch@@ l@@ ter on a 3rd January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night through so that the localities with water could be supplied .
&quot; even the power supply of Neu@@ brunn , one only can only be maintained because one filled the flood container from P@@ ett@@ stadt . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from lau@@ ters that enters the suc@@ cession of Ru@@ per@@ t G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has been killed on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ gt@@ eh@@ eide ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they are de@@ adly wo@@ unded .

&quot; the perpet@@ rat@@ ors be on the run , after him will openly declare . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be with the car on the way . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters large , mus@@ cular , brown , brown and has a smo@@ othing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the police has published a photo of him . &quot;
but it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ se .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry the weapon in itself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. sees , the 110 is supposed to call . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship of relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the responsible police in Lübeck was first to do not want to make any information about the Ta@@ ther@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rat@@ ors and victims ; but they confirmed that a person had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ ver@@ ct . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - Light@@ ing view for the German steel industry
the scratch @-@ exploited and energy @-@ ten@@ sive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millimeters .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which is the industry from the Eco @-@ Promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it is the liberation of renewable energy production for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Bundes@@ poli@@ sm@@ ini@@ ster Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ . ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally achieve negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned , the steel producer , the g@@ ases from the ho@@ cho@@ ps to electricity generation for their own consumption , to ask the cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry is threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , now there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission for talks with competition com@@ promised Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators are replaced in the steel works , all an E@@ EG change@@ over@@ s of 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall supplies the unification of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ value production .
this means that the status quo of the past regulation will be largely written .
particular importance have the successful effort from Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos;s steel is the future &apos; , this is the first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the E@@ TS , climate and employment targets are available , &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis since the financial crisis in 2008 and a considerable amount of price .
&quot; last year the situation continues to intensi@@ fied , as the world &apos;s largest invent@@ or in China given the weak@@ ening of domestic demand mass@@ aging steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers throw chin@@ ese price @-@ dump@@ ing .
in the course of this early decades the situation got something relaxed .
&quot; for one show , Ein@@ fu@@ hr@@ z@@ öl@@ le on impor@@ ters effect , on others have the economic views in China . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , as sustain@@ ably the price @-@ relaxing is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp has remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; last , prices would have been again more stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry is responding to difficult situation with further costs .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also wanted to ex@@ clude the lockers of individual works .
in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 there were around 86@@ 000 people .
in July the German steel producer remain careful despite increasing prices and growing orders .
&quot; they manufactured by 3,4 million tons good six percent less raw materials than in the prior year mon@@ at , such as the economic union of steel on Friday evening . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to the second month of suc@@ cession .
since the beginning of the year the production is made by two percent below the previous year .
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with a rising output .
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does seniors &quot;
&quot; the singing has lived Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teacher @-@ study she bel@@ lied with the music , and today s@@ ings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotional and physically , &quot; describes it . &quot;
&quot; after a sample they feel balanced , cheer@@ ful and overall lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they do something good with her health and their mind . &quot;
&quot; for mess@@ enger is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , &quot; says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler by the German Sen@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most elderly singers in the choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular inter@@ relations you can we@@ aving social contacts and maintain .
&quot; they often solve social and familiar structures at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organise themselves to the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of co @-@ awareness . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
because the seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
whoever calls for his l@@ ungs in everyday life not as fast as the pu@@ rest .
&quot; even if it is about to obtain the sound of the voice in the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; the elderly often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour community . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belon@@ ged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that the singing or listening of songs in elderly people ar@@ ouses many memories , often linked with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; by Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially mel@@ o@@ dies , even dem@@ ol@@ oured people have long been covered in a long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head is also required a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
while at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cog@@ nitive challenge .
&quot; especially older people who live alone , practice so , not only concentrate on yourself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through the singing in the chor@@ us means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem is growing through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I mean long for something , I will get better and watch@@ se through me - this experience rein@@ forces . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to begin with the singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; he wants to try to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , advis@@ es g@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t s@@ ings alone - at 50 Sing@@ ing people , who hear , when a tone goes out of it ? &quot;
looking for the suitable offer seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ings somebody from the famili@@ arity in a senior choir , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ astic choir can turn right to the church or the Church .
many seniors you can find over the internet .
&quot; who has no access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with Internet networks . &quot;
&quot; who desire has to sing , should not join a choir should necessarily join H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul good and has something evil - that applies to any age .
Cats respond sensi@@ bler as a boy on fri@@ day of the k@@ ittens
Bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover what effect the har@@ ps of cat@@ cat@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ ke did not let the male not cold - however , they kept in the difference to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arous@@ al of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys at the mi@@ xes of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster to the running of k@@ ittens who have found themselves in great need , such as scientists found by the veterinary University and the Medical University Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater may also react to the rest of k@@ ittens but always the same .
&quot; evi@@ d@@ ently , the ac@@ ous@@ tical differences between the mi@@ xes of less and strongly arous@@ ed vir@@ gins for the males either not acceptable or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke con@@ er@@ ding by the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; she is first authorized in the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and sound @-@ height of the k@@ ittens met with the ur@@ gency of their help . &quot;
&quot; all of these were observed , a total of nine grown k@@ ater and eight wives from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; you were played for a sco@@ oter of little ones , which were taken for three minutes from the worm box and separated by mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; to the other , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of stronger ra@@ inf@@ used k@@ ittens which were in addition high . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sampling .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own off@@ spring , re@@ acted upon the hor@@ rors , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned out more quickly to the speakers if this rest of the very er@@ red kit@@ ties played .
this ability may possibly be cultivated or developing with the sexual ri@@ pe .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded ever , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined several times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noise . &quot;
&quot; while some studies showed that women are sensitive to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were already mot@@ hers , or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski access@@ es with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r is a football @-@ Legend in Turkey
in Turkey against the football foot@@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r had been put into ar@@ rest warran@@ t .
&quot; it will be thrown , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; for the first time after the cou@@ p , Turkey takes place a major football game in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ ri@@ v@@ alen between B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ i Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is said .
&quot; even during the suspension of the insur@@ rection after the overthrow in July in July the government , the daily routine of norm@@ alb@@ es would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are susp@@ ects , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the football thing is not made . &quot;
against the former St@@ ark@@ ick@@ er Hak@@ an Sü@@ k@@ r presented the prosec@@ ut@@ or to a warran@@ t command .
&quot; thus , by now , there is now a member of a terrorist group , a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
addi@@ tive Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len is to be held accountable by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erd@@ og@@ an for the cou@@ p .
&quot; although the first for 90 days , the condition is still until October , actually it has on the life of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the night@@ ly &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public spaces throughout the country has declared Erd@@ og@@ an on Wednesday for termin@@ ated .
the sport is - like the whole country - split into trailer and opponents of Erd@@ og@@ an .
especially fans of the club clubs B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but given dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military cou@@ ches .
even the fans even agree - whether their heart is going to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it is especially arriving on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the distr@@ acted season under proof : with 17 T@@ oren and nine Tem@@ plates in all the competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first game @-@ time as a top@@ scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ victory .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; F@@ AN@@ ATI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; found the dis@@ appoint@@ ing season for the record Master . &quot;
after the preliminary K.@@ o in the Champions League differenti@@ ate the &quot; lions &apos; also in the Europa League early .
in the south by Li@@ g there was only one rank six .
the season was not good .
the Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we managed and this is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as was the playing year better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario G@@ ome@@ z , who laid with 26 seasons as an Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ g@@ ö@@ nig , laid the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that fans hope to return on the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC Florence under the contract and to B@@ esi@@ kt@@ as did not have known G@@ ome@@ z following the cou@@ p , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario has to come to us , he must only say it , c@@ ited the journal &quot; Kick@@ er &quot; club@@ chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the stor@@ ms would have to be ready to reno@@ un@@ ce around a third of his on 7.5 million euros , but set Or@@ man clear : &quot; his sal@@ ary in Florence , we can not pay . &quot;
despite doping : these athletes have even medals for Olympics in Rio
the 34 @-@ year Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was closed twice due to D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - Whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
others over@@ led athle@@ tics sin@@ ner can only lau@@ gh - they fight in Rio around medals .
the issue rose still according to the headlines across the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swim@@ mer@@ in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ owa , which had been charged according to an doping block her start @-@ off just before playing ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ ess and conce@@ aled . &quot;
it offered itself a sk@@ ur@@ r@@ ile scenery : with a set smile she was still decorated in the hall and had prov@@ oked with her performance .
&quot; being a stand that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ ist . &quot;
but there are still numerous other athletes who go to the start in spite of intelligence &apos;s past in Rio to the start .
here an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 @-@ 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since his b@@ ann the Olympi@@ Asian champion of 2004 and ex world champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one of the world , and is considered to be the biggest editor of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ y@@ ce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jam@@ a@@ ica ) : the two @-@ day Olympi@@ ast@@ ray and seven @-@ fold world championship in 2010 had to sit down a six sm@@ on@@ ous semen , after having proven the intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; they have had a severe ge@@ ars after an operation , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old def@@ ends itself . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ ad in 2012 was tested positive on the ban stim@@ ul@@ ant of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin in 2010 until 2016 .
Per@@ ko@@ vic be@@ amed the wis@@ s intake and was locked six months .
the four wid@@ est thro@@ ws this year go to the account of the large gold@@ pas@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympi@@ ast@@ eger and second world champion over 400 m , was a positive test and 21 months locked . &quot;
&quot; an agent for penis enlargement was responsible , bet@@ ty mer@@ ging . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old over 200 and 400 m is the fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly a athletes have been rep@@ aired so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so lost T@@ ich@@ on his World Cup titles from 2005 nine years later , after with him testosterone intelligence has been established . &quot;
the meantime 40 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid d@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ titles 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the Bron@@ cem@@ e@@ da@@ ille of the Olympic Games in 2008 was received due to an end of the International Sport@@ court yard CAS .
it is at the rank two of the Wel@@ d@@ rank list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Record and Gold@@ pas@@ tin was tested in May only in May , but still in Rio can start . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 years old world championship , references to the intake of another dietary supplement agency was found , the Sper@@ re of the world @-@ anti @-@ doping agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ ben@@ terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans hurt - Mehr@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand are in contact with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered inter@@ f@@ aded , and be treated in the hospital , but this was already left again . &quot;
your home trip will be planned for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from further explo@@ sions on the holidays ber@@ island Ph@@ uk@@ et , as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also have an Austrian citizen , is not yet un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department stands in close contact with local authorities , so snor@@ kel . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok downtown Hu@@ a H@@ in were first of the Thursday evening in a out@@ dated two bom@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the police have been killed in Thailand and about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Dutch , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Fri@@ day@@ early then again two spr@@ inkl@@ es went high , thereby , according to the authorities there was another person killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et was reported in the morning a bom@@ bing of bom@@ bs .
during the Det@@ on@@ ation near the near the tourists popular swim@@ suit Pat@@ ong was viol@@ ated a taxi driver .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country then explo@@ ded another bom@@ b that killed a municipal proposition .
the spr@@ int set was in the air to the authorities in a flower police in the air .
finally the det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the southeast coast several obli@@ que .
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the Bom@@ ben@@ att@@ ate wear the same manuscript , &quot; said Ar@@ egen@@ eral Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early before journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it may be too early to exter@@ n@@ ate yourself to possible moti@@ fs - probably , however , it is about the actions of Muslim reb@@ els . &quot;
&quot; Thai media wanted to identify a pattern with the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ bing ra@@ vine in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only a local sab@@ ot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said an speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
one rather look out that the bom@@ bs were laid from opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received sec@@ recy due to the imp@@ ending attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not been informed of the exact time and places of places . &quot;
&quot; be un@@ clear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police declared their officials throughout the country , the security of important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment . &quot;
in Thailand there are still smaller bom@@ bing ra@@ inf@@ alls but they usually do not depend against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ lim@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the traditional bom@@ bing of bom@@ bing @-@ explo@@ sions , the Austrian State Department on his homepage , the instructions of the Thai Security Auth@@ orities necessarily to do . &quot;
&quot; high safety risks ( security level 3 ) for the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ h Vi@@ este and en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and mus@@ lim@@ bic populations , there will be no necessary travel into these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risks ( security stage 2 ) for the rest of the country .
attacks on Thursday and Friday only a few days after a contro@@ versi@@ al referendum on one of the military jun@@ ta worked out .
this space will also affect the military impact in the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said , the bom@@ bs are an attempt to sti@@ cking chaos , while the country moved towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta who had sei@@ zed the power in 2014 after a phase of blo@@ ody un@@ rest , holds itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been able to have succeeded in the military revol@@ t in the extreme south of the country for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok has been killed at a popular Hind@@ u @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blo@@ ody r@@ ash of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; Identi@@ ty movement &quot; is in the Vis@@ or of the Bundes@@ minister@@ ial for Constitu@@ tional Protection .
after several govern@@ ors also placed the constitu@@ tionally in the covenant the group under observation .
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; cl@@ ues for aspir@@ ations against the free @-@ democratic basic rules , &quot; said ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immig@@ rant Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it applies to &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass @-@ migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by over@@ est@@ ran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; constitu@@ tionally in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Saxony and Thuringia - observe the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely matched to the decision with the laws . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to get their target group , where it stands &quot; , &quot; said the Constitu@@ tional chef . &quot;
&quot; generally , they are trying to address the extre@@ mi@@ sts , often with juven@@ ile language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the daily Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an active advertisement for the own thing .
the propaganda should be tem@@ pted to the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , there were reports of several federal states reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ E @-@ politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species were only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain persons who are extrem@@ ist extrem@@ ist , its targets and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is whether such individuals have a control of control over the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of recht@@ sm@@ oti@@ ates off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have observed in recent years that there can be legal structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ aler Group .
&quot; it can be quite clear that further legal entities or small groups formed , the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugees or attacks from other right @-@ wing motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of leg@@ ster@@ ism is not recogni@@ z@@ able .
the previous groups were established at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate that many handles went to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the cul@@ min@@ ate in attacks on As@@ ylum , were not previously known as criminal , politically motivated criminal attor@@ neys or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed criminal off@@ ences which previously had previously elected with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which may have chosen politically indifferent , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who have then radic@@ alised by the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;

this shows the bra@@ ve appearance of RO@@ BEL ti@@ ros Hab@@ la at the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ hau@@ led swimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could not see more in the TV @-@ pictures . &quot;
it disappeared just - no matter how far the cut @-@ out was selected .
in social networks they have subsequently become a vir@@ al inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; actually finished the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a return between 48 seconds , and exposed the 59@@ th place of 59 . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly spor@@ ty figure that drew attention to the attention of international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds are taking part at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiopia has got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
&quot; since in e@@ eing the most athletes , he wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BEL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quick made the first po@@ stage for the lap .
some media signed him as &quot; RO@@ BEL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ condition &quot; &quot; the English Bou@@ lev@@ ard@@ blatt &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .

the un@@ final travellers were brought back by a regular bus back to the cru@@ m@@ ble district P@@ ew@@ sum .

&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters of wast@@ ew@@ ater is from 1 October 2016 for the area of the water@@ tank Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously made from 16 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( now 2,@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the water fee will be charged at the latest once again if corresponding improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a clear calculation , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in Az@@ endorf then will be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( C@@ SU ) reported , was observed in the approval of the household by the land@@ fill Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these wast@@ ew@@ ater @-@ areas under@@ mines . &quot;
the market of Kas@@ endorf is oblig@@ ated due to legal basis to operate the equipment cost @-@ out .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial generation of puppy , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg can attack deeper into the money bag . &quot;
the en@@ roll@@ ment increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as management manager Herbert Schmidt on the board showed , a re @-@ calculation of fees for the wast@@ ew@@ ater of the market is necessary . &quot;
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 also over - and sub @-@ covers from the previous calendar period .
&quot; the engra@@ vings increased in all three se@@ wage systems by relatively small facilities with a very small de@@ hydr@@ ation handle , which between 68@@ 00 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution of distribution for instance , for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have engra@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the wast@@ ew@@ ater in all three systems be slightly weak@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the back @-@ establishment period in all three systems are not least due to its age and repair expenditure in a significant circum@@ ference . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf sei is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt proved that in the water @-@ water Az@@ endorf had to be changed the mechanical ventilation system due to an ind@@ em@@ nity .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old funding had to over@@ hau@@ led and when the pond water tank had to be installed after nearly 20 years , the stap@@ le pond and an additional exposure to be installed in order to keep the water legal requirements in future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; at these extraordinary expendit@@ ures , the advanced supervision and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new Cal@@ culation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the stone houses made clear that during the low waste water fall into the three plants the expendit@@ ures for the operation and maintenance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , added Schmidt , the market of large entertainment costs during wast@@ ew@@ ater during the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above plants will continue to remain prec@@ arious situation on the long term , especially as you could not extend the supply area of the wast@@ ew@@ ater Federation Fri@@ esen@@ b@@ acht@@ al around these systems because it is about de@@ structive facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria insi@@ der for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as a positive 0.2 % .
annual average flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1,0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.3 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods observed : food and non alcoholic drinks ( 1,@@ 7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; transport and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Anim@@ e &quot; -@@ Eff@@ ect as Asi@@ atic car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is Anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some ob@@ servers say that it is impro@@ per facing bre@@ eds .
&quot; with his filter tool , it allows sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to alter the reality and to play with identi@@ ties that already borders as absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Lich@@ tenstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are distinctive , independent tools that generate more than 30 million increased rar@@ ity per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will arrive to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have moved in the past critic@@ isms that they were acc@@ used that the app black@@ face @-@ oriented or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week proposed a filter by giving them a filter , which gave them sl@@ ats , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , n@@ knew there some critics of a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow . &quot;
they ques@@ tioned whether this re@@ peti@@ tive contro@@ vers@@ y was transferred to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the rebel@@ lion were widely spread on Wednesday with reports of The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company offered a exc@@ use : the filter was meant as hom@@ age to anim@@ e @-@ characters and not meant as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ standing , the se@@ is@@ m@@ atism have experienced , re@@ minded of the filters of vulnerable t@@ apping . &quot;
others have decided the anim@@ e @-@ comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ et over the photos were widely used that the filter &apos; hurt and bar@@ k was anno@@ ying . &quot;
they added that &quot; it is difficult to ar@@ gue with the Counter@@ motion of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not successful , but that the Genti@@ le was drawn into the decreasing extre@@ mi@@ ties . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride @-@ wire .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless di@@ vers@@ ation and integration process , from conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in things as their elderly coun@@ cils - could rather go beyond sensitivity .
&quot; if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture generated , that it &apos;s much harder to notice that such stuff was un@@ noticed when it was previously the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Zh@@ u decided that works as a product management and engineers for medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and ur@@ ged others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an ess@@ ay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that they believe that rac@@ ed contro@@ versi@@ es have to reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed to the great part white , only male leadership and ended their attachment with an has@@ ht@@ ag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese American Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they are safe or beneficial to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat was mostly un@@ answered . &quot;
the company publish@@ es no figures on the diversity of its employees and points to its status as priv@@ ately owned company .
&quot; on Thursday , it &apos;s Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently submitted a personnel responsible to under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in her turn , that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I ask myself whether they need more users like us to say that that is not o.@@ k@@ . . &quot;
military @-@ direc@@ ting IS@@ IS intelligence service @-@ information , represents the committee of the Congress . &quot;
&quot; military cooperation of the United States Central Command changed re@@ claim@@ ing financial information to record an optim@@ istic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual states of the Congress , signed by the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the provisional report , created by a Task Force the Republi@@ can members of the disputes committee , Secret Doc@@ tor@@ ees and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ary , reported by major dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command Secret Services , which reported the assessment of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tampa , Florida that controls the American military units in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news services , which typically have been sent from high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Kom@@ man@@ de@@ acids , signed regularly a positive image of American efforts against terrorism when the actual states on site have been allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other news services , &quot; c@@ ited a newspaper articles . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders will be presented , Ken Cal@@ vert , re@@ publi@@ cis@@ ed member of the representative house . &quot;
the guidel@@ ine in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top @-@ top of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report presents detailed issues in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in education of Ira@@ qi Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; though there are no direct hints to that government tips given to Obama guidance , showing how an@@ alysts are exposed to the pressure from their pre @-@ laws , an optim@@ istic image of the threat of the Islamic state , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half @-@ year 2015 many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , statements and statements are significantly more positive than the facts presented to the Congress . &quot;
&quot; for instance , a Cent@@ Com is publicly known that a military recon@@ quest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin already in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second @-@ largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , re@@ publi@@ cis@@ cal Con@@ federation from K@@ ansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the tips of Central Command changed the re@@ claim@@ ing reports to run the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans brought the Task Force into life after it was played that an@@ alysts are concerned with regard to the mani@@ p@@ ulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed insights throughout the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the General In@@ spec@@ ulate of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; democratic members of the news catalogue , published on Thursday their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; during the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com creates a complete process for creating a provision of IS@@ IL and the Ira@@ qi security services , &quot; gave the highest stran@@ ger Dem@@ ok@@ Council in the Com@@ mitt@@ ee , Member of the Represent@@ atives Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; del@@ ayed the publication of thought@@ ful reports , &quot; compens@@ ated the mor@@ als under an@@ alysts &quot; and &quot; gave rise up little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ p and Democrats have made no advice on an intervention of the White House with the Cent@@ Com Analy@@ ses with regards to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Beast &quot; .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by the General In@@ spec@@ ulate of the Pent@@ agon , which were taken after complaints from Cent@@ Com Analy@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a spokes@@ man of the Pent@@ agon , gave no reports of the Congress in an opinion that the defence of Defence would be no reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general practitioner is still going on . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Defence Minister has to greet the contro@@ vers@@ y discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigations have taken back on the question of a successful air @-@ campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the acc@@ us@@ ations of the past year have raised the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honor@@ ary estimates of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds us of more than ten years , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a scri@@ bed about it , such as the dam@@ p government under George W. Bush presented the recommendations of many an@@ alysts , and a little time on the result of the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to specification of government agencies , that contrary to the Government of air sur@@ charges are not significant on the financial situation of the terrorist attack , since these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ic refin@@ ing took place in operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Command holders , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislative assessment of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the U.S. gain fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of the women , a show@@ down with great Britain before . &quot;
&quot; a day after they had shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American cant@@ ors team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I do not belong to people who kept their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on first place that remain un@@ be@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first lap .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their group . &quot;
the first @-@ placed forces will take a little longer moving out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game will go on Saturday , the Americ@@ an@@ ers caused by their success story with their success story , four years after they land@@ ed over the past London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time playing a hockey r@@ ack@@ et in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 as they could not qualify for the cad@@ ence .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went all wrong .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an English , coach of the national team and thus the things began to consult . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and an bodi@@ ly change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have been able to rip it all over the world .
&quot; on Thursday night , b@@ am the cake opened in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand cover from the local area . &quot;
&quot; India went to the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed herself surprising and lasted from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am the game took up into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she finished one spr@@ int with the flat ball through the left flan@@ k , then moved into the center and lu@@ te the ball in the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Melissa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ eper of the USA , Jackie Brig@@ gs , which had previously made a gate in any of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ oline
wherever you are also how late it is too , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro will feel durable and in@@ escap@@ able , a rapid e@@ ell@@ ate between competition and quest . &quot;
&quot; it is , when the Olympic sol@@ ack@@ el itself is a burning st@@ ab , which is taken from the w@@ rist@@ watch to swim to the g@@ ymn@@ asts to the tri@@ ath@@ l@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; you cannot turn the TV , read a newspaper or talk to your neighbors in the queu@@ e , without over Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the battle between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women of women with di@@ m@@ ples , would certainly have been sent under these known names , built up to Prime Time , built by sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising if he would be a swim@@ mer , g@@ ymn@@ asts or even fur . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting in the ol@@ ymp@@ ic tramp@@ oline around gold . &quot;
the Olympic Fl@@ ame is not lit every event .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports , which are not generally recognized : aviation @-@ shooting , Archery , Bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ w@@ ondo . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and let it rule for a long time .
&quot; but when I might make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the tramp@@ oline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been a ol@@ ymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it was in Sydney there was the last 16 years that many that I asked , did not know that there is at all a Olympi@@ ast@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional Ig@@ nor@@ ance .
&quot; although the United States won athletes a competition , it has never won a medal at the tramp@@ oline and until 2012 had made a athletes who made it up to the end . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians are nei@@ gh the prizes for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share women for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend its gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ ines has a certain outdoor teacher , partly because it sounds good for the un@@ cle@@ ared ear for a c@@ lown@@ fish school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should ad@@ mit that I am not an expert , but only an inher@@ ited enthusiasm . &quot;
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ a@@ on@@ ous tre@@ m@@ bling of his never to end b@@ ish m@@ alls - but also the refin@@ ement of the rotation and diving that combines two sports .
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El tramp@@ oline , which means as much means &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic tramp@@ oline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympi@@ ast@@ gram according to execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ standing athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are joined together in Rio to another . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight .
&quot; medallists in their quest for gold further , faster , upward and dr@@ over , sometimes to finish , sometimes back and back , to the top and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they are not only the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the cur@@ ling , but in the television transfer , also another cav@@ ity : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented quest is no@@ ble , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir@@ ring a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I feel at the spect@@ ator of these games as a bit ti@@ ring .
of which offers the tramp@@ oline a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ oline is above .
a prec@@ arious movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t from , seem@@ ingly heavy as an ast@@ ron@@ aut , go upward , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here there is a competition , naturally not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no he@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves into the distance , just the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in Stre@@ aming to 13.00 Eastern Time ; those of the men on Saturday , also 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will be radi@@ ated as part of an afternoon blocks on both days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; when the consciousness raising only reached by the anxiety and the objec@@ tivity of mascul@@ ine athletes - as it recently sm@@ ashed the male US Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits its after air ring@@ ent , new fan@@ fare . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested in Ethiopia , Long a fo@@ e of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia presented to violent resistance of the government .
witnesses said that v@@ enty prot@@ esters during the gathering with the police have been killed in a shift .
is Ethiopia just to break up ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid fo@@ e of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government against the government and extends over the last few months . &quot;
last week turbul@@ ent thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful to human rights organizations .
witnesses gave to the fact that polic@@ emen were shot up in zig un@@ paid prot@@ esters .
&quot; in circulation to the protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men will show young people with st@@ aves , while these were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for human rights is now asking for incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa der International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the pop@@ ulated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands at considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ ute in the capital of Addi@@ s A@@ be@@ ba .
the roads are usually quiet and safe and clean .
&quot; even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited , whereby dis@@ si@@ dents were effective at the silence . &quot;
many were sent to exile or in prison or driven into the breadth of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and do not have any other options except prot@@ ru@@ ding , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot;
the entire youth are prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover all from the floor to thro@@ ws up to the thro@@ ws within the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a large @-@ ently critic@@ ised elections last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously , the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this z@@ ack@@ y , contro@@ versi@@ al line ur@@ ged in June hundreds of life . &quot;
an@@ alysts fear that separatists like the Oro@@ mo @-@ liber@@ ating Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden which could have more or less forced into the past few years and could be re@@ ared again .
several factors explain why feelings of the per@@ ation after years of pro@@ voc@@ ate under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harm@@ less : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , a lot of Ethiopia were able to communicate with the social media , since cheap smartphones have ever been more common and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government bol@@ ts access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially with protests , many people can still communicate more about internet pro@@ xy @-@ ies which hide themselves . &quot;
several young people gave them that they were so different to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two biggest eth@@ ni@@ cs in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosper@@ ous , the Am@@ har@@ as , the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from the Aegean Sea mainly in the politics and the economy , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and in flat@@ lands . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests found in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tig@@ ray , which are around 6 percent of the population and who are in the military , in the sec@@ recy , in commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former reb@@ els , was up to his death at a non @-@ known disease in 2012 17 years of Greek prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was viewed as tac@@ tical geni@@ us , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; an@@ alysts say that he was particularly diversi@@ fied in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and special parties to use to edit opponents and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime lack this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , has been selected for relatively un@@ timely reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; other than Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region North Ethiop@@ ian , comes Lord H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am from the south . &quot;
an@@ alysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blo@@ od@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia was a tur@@ mo@@ il lived in 2005 , after thousands of elections pro@@ gres@@ sed , according to the information of an@@ alysts , apparently circul@@ ated by the government and subsequently st@@ olen . &quot;
&quot; during the following , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ises the leaders for their vision@@ ary infra@@ structural planning , such as the new comm@@ its , as well as for its meas@@ urable progress in poverty alle@@ vi@@ ation . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal ab@@ norm@@ ative government of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month of the prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray guided businesses and the hat@@ ges towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming ever more evil in the social media . &quot;
an@@ alysts say that protests and other Western allies put into a peculi@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ties on the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently ref@@ used that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West wants to support democracy clearly , he will not want his fo@@ e in an already vol@@ ati@@ al area collap@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin grass . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his argument was founded IS@@ IS be &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to dis@@ si@@ p@@ ate the last contro@@ vers@@ y that his campaign reveals that his multi @-@ reg@@ ained claims , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist state , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fies new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Re@@ public@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its fellow @-@ stre@@ et@@ it@@ ars that endeav@@ our to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the appropri@@ at@@ ly position , statements , which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the dec@@ eption during an elect@@ oral event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp was made in relation to the claim on Thursday and consi@@ sted in interviews that he really had not intended to suggest , the President and Mrs. Clinton had IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in a morning Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp , he is simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the exc@@ uses completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conserv@@ ative radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to we@@ aken him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it , the re@@ publi@@ can presidential can@@ did nothing about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism is pr@@ as@@ le@@ ashed to Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton had speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday tried Mr. Tru@@ mp again to return to this subject .
&quot; through Twitter , he war@@ ned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would cause suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought its defense to its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism against himself when he said , the Russians ought to hate Mrs. Clin@@ tons of e @-@ mail , but he later stated &quot; &quot; Natural Now I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to move the boundaries to politics and then back to the needs .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be recorded as they arrive , and then if appropriate , &quot; &quot; says Ruth Sh@@ erman , a communication presentation , which the language of both candidates were observed . &quot;
&quot; but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of putting the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp has taken an even estimated tone since its re@@ fr@@ age@@ able . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was published on Friday , showed a leadership with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ at @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ al expression , he acc@@ used his critics frequently to distor@@ ted his statements or his humor wrong . &quot;
&quot; but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow @-@ stre@@ et@@ ites into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements also may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp@@ s prominent leaders , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N @-@ interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani therefore he asks for the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Mr IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back@@ win@@ der , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Ma@@ instream @-@ Re@@ public@@ ans are trying to ar@@ gu@@ ed that the government under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external minister in served , it allowed IS@@ IS to cur@@ se themselves by bringing it to the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the elect@@ oral events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and cast them before , on each of his words , and to be heard against him . &quot;
&quot; he denied the &quot; poor , j@@ amm@@ able &quot; television experts , who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can not ! &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats about Mr. Tru@@ mp@@ s exc@@ use as only one further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once more than the cost of the market , Café in Green@@ point will come back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a compens@@ ated cafe in William@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices made from its Bedford Avenue store@@ front was displ@@ aced . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , set the Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
locals noticed it as the last loss in a gent@@ leman in a gent@@ leman .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ sten@@ o wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB was dead , the Chelsea hotel and ver@@ b now a soap @-@ shop is . &quot;
&quot; but if New York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a busy ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ year staff of old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began to work in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; he offered a customer to provide funds for a new outdoor market , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept much at . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the Bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verse .
&quot; however , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he also wanted to experiment . &quot;
he brought new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wich@@ es with bac@@ on and che@@ eses and there are Gar@@ ni@@ ers such as KA@@ Per@@ n and s@@ our oni@@ ons .
there are natural re@@ actors .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh ju@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months of Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a st@@ alled electricity to old tri@@ bal clients . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also driven by prices from William@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , dwelt earlier in William@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after they had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path to himself . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she was a while the coffee maker she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that fell upon me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even if they presented on this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coff@@ ees a bl@@ ended C@@ hai Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time old and loyal customer since the beginning of the ver@@ b .
he went there before work and presented inev@@ it@@ ably always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch , and they prepare my Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and set new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Bag@@ el with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he did not be a Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie will actually make a special soap for se@@ b with the cold , coffee of cafés as an ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down on their offerings , &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into the Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , that he has pre@@ aching them soon to make their new neighbors welcome . &quot;
the site also has its advantages .
a local S@@ aft@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands onto a neighboring building .
for many customers a new hi@@ b is sufficient to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was the master and said he was destroyed by the floor than the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the beg@@ ining of the Lok@@ as and the bestsellers of a new coffee , like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to sm@@ elled them , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing meal of the economic crisis in &quot; an plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin DEL@@ ANO Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t took a lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as gour@@ mets had President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t had a Fai@@ thful for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Aqu@@ abi@@ ke soup .
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled Eg@@ gs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , pot@@ ato br@@ ice and as dessert a pl@@ ush . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of gastronomic solidarity with the people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e said , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histor@@ ians .
&quot; co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the U.S. , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orchard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustr@@ ate the history of American cuisine while the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop to dinner , a small , sn@@ ake Im@@ bis@@ s in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , set a smo@@ k@@ äs@@ s@@ and@@ wich with olive trees , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with pot@@ ato br@@ oth and mix@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter Hack@@ ers , this took the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
there was Erd@@ n@@ uss@@ bro@@ t , liver and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingre@@ dient , and some cheap that stretched the ingre@@ dient . &quot;
&quot; imagine , so many pe@@ anu@@ ts to eat , that they serve them as a dinner . &quot;
co@@ e gr@@ in@@ ct .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach as a bite , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years ahead of the Great Depression the table was in an American household , mainly in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ats for male rims , and it became fresh@@ ly b@@ aked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent to star@@ ve Europeans during the first world war . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; is the ways that the country went so , no longer the sl@@ ar@@ ming of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a key , ten@@ se theme was &quot; &quot; beg@@ ed co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as an@@ dest@@ ined was the new bud@@ get@@ y : mysterious food such as Br@@ ote and K@@ asser@@ tions were re@@ mun@@ er@@ ated as a &quot; wonderful way , me@@ al@@ rem@@ n@@ ment &quot; , &quot; mer@@ ged bri@@ ck@@ man , since chefs were un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a Cre@@ y sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap drying .
&quot; meat that was the centre of the American kitchen , was a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculi@@ ar bl@@ ends have been tried , since a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ishing satisfaction has priority to taste or even healthy cuisine . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book that includes also recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man made a dish from that epoch , b@@ aked oni@@ ons with pe@@ anu@@ t butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular add @-@ on for lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ mann leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
chocolate butter and b@@ aked oni@@ ons do not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , tri@@ pod household econom@@ ists - including Louise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country such . &quot;
&quot; published in newspapers and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household policy &quot; , &quot; and the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ m@@ ous sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti with car@@ r@@ ots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Garden &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to the hungry citizen , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he had publicly pra@@ ised the simple I@@ owa farmer &apos;s kitchen in his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed as the milli@@ on@@ ous man of the world , which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a almost g@@ ild@@ ed food @-@ room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was wonderful real@@ est@@ ation .
&quot; President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t could have been committed to the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ ate him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the an@@ heu@@ gel was described with no interest in flav@@ ours by Ms Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t that brought the White House of the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most powerful food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of great depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continued focus on cal@@ ories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave to the writing of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man re@@ minded : &quot; she made people actually sick .
there was the windsurfing case .
&quot; after the dish of Eisen@@ berg &apos;s cle@@ ared , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ ums , the President Roo@@ se@@ vel@@ t had lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a real trick , hum@@ ble recipes to send a name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there were no sho@@ ot@@ ene cream , just p@@ aving , some fl@@ our , sugar , water and c@@ inn@@ amon . &quot;
each di@@ pped somewhat disgu@@ ised a sp@@ oon in the fence , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it not tasted bad . &quot;

he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Om@@ ar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ky everything to save others lives .
now is the 30 @-@ year @-@ old even at a fac@@ bom@@ bs attack of Assad &apos;s regime .
&quot; Om@@ ar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Hel@@ mets &quot; , &quot; a civil group , which has been saved to the life according to Bild @-@ Zeitung until almost 60@@ ,000 people have saved life . &quot;
29@@ 00 Volunte@@ ers put their own life on the game to draw people from bom@@ b@@ ted houses and to make their own help in the war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Om@@ ar was the face of the group : a video of the civil@@ isation , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a cleans@@ ing out of the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world . &quot;
it made the Syrian to the g@@ lowing symbol in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I suggest life to save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Om@@ ar fell to an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ bing attacks in Syria . &quot;
the helicopter took four fac@@ bom@@ bs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with Ch@@ l@@ org@@ as . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven men are suffering from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the gi@@ fted rem@@ n@@ ants of bom@@ b , so that they do not play the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the de@@ adly bom@@ b of Assad had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land : the oldest spine is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come in winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the go@@ z@@ h@@ y S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ o@@ ded with a glass of 1 km / h through the Nor@@ mand@@ lan@@ tics - until today .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie only got up with 150 years of off@@ spring .
&quot; the Green@@ land@@ shar@@ ks along the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks along the bottom of the Nor@@ dat@@ lan@@ ti@@ ks , in an hour , it is on average of just 1,@@ 220 metres far . &quot;
&quot; only when it is arrives , the five meters long animal cuts up 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ ur . &quot;
this one of long @-@ effic@@ acy lifestyle seems to be a patent to be for a high age .
&quot; Juli@@ us Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; at any rate of a Greenland , the 392 years old could be . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ ans from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for dem@@ ographic research in Rostock this period of life , which means for vert@@ eb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already has long , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie . &quot;
only faul@@ ts the evidence .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally , they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the thin @-@ settled co@@ asts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
&quot; about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
&quot; their time @-@ out @-@ reb@@ ates they , when they are facing the Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen six animals with a transmitter equipment . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ mare make these ha@@ y nevertheless : in the stomach of a beast , researchers found the rem@@ n@@ ants of a Rob@@ ots , another had the max@@ bones of a young ic@@ eberg . &quot;
possibly j@@ ars they sleeping animals or pat@@ rol illi@@ ers at the bottom of the Eis@@ me@@ eres and look for K@@ ada@@ ver that tor@@ n from higher water stories after the bottom .
&quot; Juli@@ us Niel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fish@@ erman between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen and cat@@ ching from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cen@@ tim@@ eters long while the largest 502 cen@@ tim@@ eters .
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , analy@@ sing them with the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ method the ruler of the Ha@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eyel@@ ash arises already before the birth of shar@@ ks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had striking much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ kers .
&quot; hence , your birth should therefore lie after the early 19@@ 60s , as nuclear @-@ weapon try larger amounts of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 cen@@ tim@@ eters length of third animal contained the lens against carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland ha@@ y had a normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k with 502 Zen@@ tim@@ eters even 392 years old might be expected . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k will only get off@@ spring , when they are longer than four metres , was known . &quot;
now the researchers got to sub@@ ordin@@ ate an age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 392 cen@@ tim@@ eters probably at the thres@@ hold of the sexually mature , and his age was appointed with 156 years , the Greenland @-@ ha@@ y can obviously at least one @-@ half centuries of time . &quot;
also this is likely to be used for vert@@ eb@@ rates at the world .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live mainly in icy waters is no coinci@@ dence .
&quot; also the previous record @-@ holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ et tip , was captured from Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , often the organism of the animals live there live on austerity . &quot;
they mature later - and s@@ atin s@@ lower .
&quot; to warm up in cold water , the animals are also often especially large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal is heating . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on how much as possible as many off@@ spring as possible , explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist sc@@ rub@@ lein . &quot;
a very big animal should be in contrast to its resources rather than a long life .
construction of a double pack
with topics around B@@ auen the community at the most recent meeting deals with sever@@ ely .
&quot; with relief the panel took the message by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the younger d@@ well@@ ings can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ li@@ fication and lock@@ able questions were clari@@ fied and the applications were asked for measurement , the sale of the plots in the residential @-@ areas &quot; street &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße ) and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section 1 ) of interested parties nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the conf@@ ession surfaces in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and r@@ am@@ ental seniors alike .
&quot; as it was , the re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance can register now in the City Hall , on the allocation of the plots will probably be advised in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; to also change requests to the annex@@ ation of further industrial estates , combined with the creation of jobs to be trac@@ ed , decided to change the simil@@ arities in part in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ time , the commercial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in direction of national road . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the main street with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg has the best opportunities to re@@ mark jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited from the Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence field markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is un@@ certain whether money @-@ houses can continue to operate from London for financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport far the approval in the UK .
this is just a big US @-@ banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
the Lob@@ by@@ union &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects to exceed 10000 new jobs in the Main Event five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities like the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the emergency bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg secre@@ tariat is a large fund industry , cutting as well as Dublin at the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is easy to reach in Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
further points the city with easy available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris it is not that easy to find free quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we were also rented by 50 percent higher for first @-@ class commercial properties at 50 percent higher than am Main . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the corporate coun@@ sel Mer@@ cer stand the city on square seven , Luxembourg at square 19 , Dublin on position 33 and Paris at 37@@ . place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial position for the European market could move Frankfurt further banks and investors &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London will remain despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um most important financial centre in Europe , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; this also speak the forces of relations : in London , according to numbers of Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba late 2015 around 14@@ 4000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

Clin@@ t earn 10.8 million in 2015 and pay 34,@@ 2 % reduction
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced on Friday its tax deadline for 2015 , this flow@@ ed for the presidential and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax of 34,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons of USD 1 Million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; the former president Bill Clinton received an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t Candi@@ date for the Vice President , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton its tax statements of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax of 20.@@ 3 % in the year 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ins continue to set standards with respect to financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons Kamp@@ agn@@ en@@ hel@@ fer@@ in J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
in a stark contrast to the Donald Tru@@ mp hidden behind incorrect expres@@ sions and back @-@ pul@@ ling in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax statements .
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have expressed the reason for its den@@ ial a tax inspection by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote Clin@@ t elect@@ oral hel@@ pers , Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential system of the democr@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Co@@ hen , Tru@@ mp@@ s special advis@@ er , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before the tax inspec@@ tions are not finished . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp@@ s Cri@@ tics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential race of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already rep@@ utable issues relating to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , its business divisions and various other compounds , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton had already been over@@ thrown on the subject and released on Friday a video on the internet in which high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp is calling for its tax return .
on Thursday she also spoke during a speech on the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refuse to do what any other presidential kan@@ ism has done in the last decades and publish its tax conclusions . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Pol@@ tico has reported that Tru@@ mp has not paid for two years or only very little taxes , and a economic policy of New York Times quoted on Friday a number of tax hav@@ n and tax@@ pay@@ ers who might be the case . &quot;
federal states have become a subject in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that individuals will earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an elect@@ oral event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Berk@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial group has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to a meeting on their tax explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said , he had been subjected to a tax check of the IR@@ S and Tru@@ mp have &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ t Camp@@ a@@ ign campaign has published tax return for 2007 to the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons that now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average of an effective federal tax of about 32 % between the years 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40,@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this only USD 100 of its income as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their major financial investment was an cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ics divi@@ den@@ ds and yiel@@ ds of USD 109@@ .000 . &quot;

Jewish Director defe@@ ats Berlin Hotel because Israeli Pres@@ entations was removed after an Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots ent@@ ails a media watch , having betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ election , since there are Arabian guests according to a employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Hol@@ oc@@ au@@ st@@ documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; sent his hass@@ le at Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by giving an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the coun@@ sel@@ en@@ list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be accessed directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si Bristol offers a chance to choose Israel over its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel &apos;s reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel said that the measure is a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
&quot; the reason behind it was , sol@@ dering in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the An@@ ders of Lanz@@ mann has been c@@ ited . &quot;
the Israeli amb@@ assador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Commerce called this a &quot; great shame &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports .
we were dispos@@ ed of this event and troub@@ led .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has borne out in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even bigger shame . &quot;
this does not require explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions draws &quot; , &quot; said the ministers . &quot;
the inci@@ dent explo@@ res a pretty big reson@@ ance on the internet in which people know the whole thing a scan@@ dal .
some created the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that would have been given the in@@ adequate requirements of arab@@ ic guests .
&quot; ash@@ amed to you , it was in a different post that was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the no@@ b@@ arian Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all the exc@@ uses of themselves and called the inci@@ dent an &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ olog@@ ised &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include in the quick@@ list &quot; , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung on the spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
it adds that the country code was now added .

the police set mo@@ ur@@ ly and rub@@ bers against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , which led to the police led rub@@ bers and lac@@ ri@@ ans . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their records about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals of the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ .000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly increases to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; the lifting of sanctions grew according to the Russian amb@@ assador of Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ary@@ an , the trade agreement between Moscow and Teheran in the annual comparison of 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interests of Russian enterprises grew strongly in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , further trade @-@ building is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ary@@ an . &quot;
he thank@@ ed that the trade show between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 by 7@@ 0.3 percent compared to the same period in 2015 increase and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran at 9@@ 1.5 per cent br@@ ink and amoun@@ ted to $ 697 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; trade @-@ down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ary@@ an continues to take a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year the Russian ad tre@@ aties around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , on Ira@@ qi citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries which affects tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; you could say that the record figures Irish tourists in Russia from the last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time relatively few Russians go to Iran , something , of which the amb@@ assador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Sh@@ ir@@ az and Y@@ az@@ d , who received Mon@@ uments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

together were four stages to cop@@ ed .
&quot; in order to survive the time until the next Romantic Get@@ ting of all Mini@@ stries in the last two years , the Ober@@ min@@ ist@@ ran@@ ten@@ round St. Anna was decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
various Wall@@ papers was tested and we finally decided to b@@ ail for the Bis@@ hop stadt of Freiburg where the mercy seat of mercy at the Frei@@ burger Münster is offered a special pilgrimage goal .
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bronn , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ lo@@ ch and Heiligen@@ stadt arose along the way . &quot;

Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner rus@@ hed home as Br@@ ite Gold for Bike
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ ill ra@@ ste last evening in the male team Spr@@ int in the bicycle team in Rio to glory as the British Team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the An@@ chor@@ dal , which had made his cap@@ e of Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the junior and made the legend proud , when he stor@@ my home to a victory of the favourites of New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory over four years ago during Ho@@ y the fifth of six Olympi@@ ad medals .
&quot; she recovered the trick , after it in March at the Bahn World Championships in London despite the return testi@@ s , only one modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the rider Jam@@ ie Staff .
they did this in time as an end @-@ up .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ re and created a gap , the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to close . &quot;
&quot; sk@@ inner was the man , where they remained , when they saw potential in the ra@@ vine which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; warning , Kenn@@ y - the first four years ago with Ho@@ y vict@@ orious - and sk@@ inner sat in the Quali@@ fication round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the stand@@ ar@@ round tri@@ pled the New York mar@@ gins in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his turn was just below , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and sk@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of transformation , when the execution in a higher step flow to slow@@ down him and allow it to keep it wis@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw his position as a BBC expert , and fell sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y , and Hin@@ dus , as these on the po@@ dium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year ski @-@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a narrow comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make me a name .
we have positioned an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the En@@ dr@@ unde and defe@@ ated the world master .
it was simply unbeliev@@ able .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the tri@@ umph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was so that he fell after a weak start on the train . &quot;
he moved later this statement later and there was no obj@@ ection of England Riv@@ alen .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; It feels with the whole GB flags on the ble@@ achers like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we have been so bad for so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if the bar@@ ometer for our progress in the last five months is that we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ ys it is in the area of the possible that he &apos;s Ho@@ ys victory of three ol@@ ymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition repeated . &quot;
&quot; this would be for Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently hei@@ ght@@ ed date for British sport ; on the day , Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a out@@ set of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the fighters of the testi@@ y is the same .
Kenn@@ y is next in the Spr@@ int part which starts today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels somewhat lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the Knight . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medallists in the day , but there were another good news for England . &quot;
Sir Br@@ aga Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and Ow@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometers . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the World Record , which won in London in 2012 at 3 : 5@@ 1,6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; today , the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) today will take place on the second day of the competition , with the Wig@@ gins with certainty in focus . &quot;
&quot; he had turned up yesterday with officers before the qualification , when the functioning of himself called upon himself to measure his height . &quot;

the GB Team leaves itself on his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the Middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a sn@@ ar to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio was driving . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ ans have played in the background , so the withdrawal of the technical leit@@ ner Sh@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ is@@ m@@ - and bul@@ lock , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite narrow , as the now legendary reputation of GB@@ s , which has reached the perfect moment its climax again . &quot;
future of the melt by Port@@ land due to the removal of the energy tr@@ ages
&quot; the future of aluminum drums from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are standing on the game , since the plant operator announce the energy supply contract and thereby up@@ lift all supply agreements , such as the remote energy undertak@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsi@@ dies on the operation of the plant . &quot;
one for 20 years will be recorded in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the complex of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land , stand on the game . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at a close risk .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ o@@ effects since the mel@@ ting cut around 10 percent of the entire electricity generation Vic@@ t@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa , the Point Henry melt , which led last year to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea strength . &quot;
the mel@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and ris@@ ky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Austr@@ al@@ ischen Dollars and finally due to the current price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which delivered the great aluminium panels with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , shared with that three additional owners announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Alum@@ ina , by the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Corp . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assum@@ ing that the plant is continuing to operate in Port@@ land , which means a further physical demand for electricity through the mel@@ ting , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said furthermore , that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ gers &quot; , &quot; which should have taken into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of cancellation so that they will end .
&quot; from this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will be contributing to the revenue , &quot; said the current supplier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong terminals for wholesale prices . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that the value of the Tre@@ aties has already written in its annual decline in the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; &quot; expect@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... the mel@@ ting to operate or supply the power supply to the mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; the US @-@ company said that there was a 20 @-@ year contract concluded with Lo@@ y Yang in November that , from November this year could have come into force , even though it is still a statement to withdraw from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ tic war@@ n due to the poor economic relations of the industry in front of the possible closing of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analy@@ st the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land every year 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and Tom@@ ago will consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as electricity producer that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ Output of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner C@@ lan@@ s Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand amb@@ assador of Est@@ at Lau@@ der is and went on the fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure of the Co@@ vers followed a ch@@ iz@@ res ( or just keeping up with the Car@@ da@@ shi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , soci@@ able Reality video , which ends the entire Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ ver @-@ On@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as they end the cover of her sister , and which ends with a classical turn : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this presents the clever action in nearly every Birth@@ day ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You susp@@ end that we have forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the honest@@ y of a cartoon by 8 am in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ Output , the vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era of the Kar@@ da@@ shi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls Big Si@@ ster Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue Cover goes , be@@ aten ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ &apos;s magazine is a le@@ ague for himself . &quot;
the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ Output is the most frequently selling issue of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles an image as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut fas@@ hi@@ oni@@ sta were obtained from the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 615 Pages ) . &quot;
the un@@ veil@@ ing of his cover stars is expected so se@@ hn@@ addi@@ ctive that in the last two years of the magazine is still sol@@ dered before the official announcements .
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ om@@ i Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ist@@ a and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity the@@ ites , the model@@ ers &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ity &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was 2013 at the Cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - that is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ age model &quot; &quot; of her generation - under the former category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these bulbs are not related to famous people or Reality Stars , or young people of today that know how to revol@@ ve a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to den@@ ominator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once that appeared on the last covers had been one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s success not every success . &quot;
with her Reality @-@ TV @-@ story J@@ enn@@ ers stood still somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world .
&quot; in June critic@@ ised the un@@ favorable Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner , and her colleague Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mi@@ st@@ pieces of the eyel@@ ids . &quot;
these feelings bo@@ iled back highly as the message with the show J@@ enn@@ ers came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ lead , it seems to be pre@@ mature@@ ly at the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Se@@ pt@@ ember@@ Output of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it works for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your gr@@ unt from Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all their sisters sell pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold by her painted pictures from C@@ indy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the German magazine .
and in her spare time she is at the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; common centers , each year 160@@ .000 people &quot;
more than 160@@ .000 inhabitants of the country will be ref@@ used annually by the community centres , while the industry will have passed on to the impact of other medi@@ ations over already over@@ load transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queens@@ land there are three of five persons - mostly older people , Im@@ mig@@ rant workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for un@@ just Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ers and such a similar way - when searching for free legal advice and legal action . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community that are already over@@ heated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , the legal centers will lose further 30 percent of its federal states . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the final survey of the National Association of municipalities centers that already exist thousands of people every year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation without a lifting of the decision of the Federal Government would only be worse . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ land community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , what means thousands of people of important services that you need to be ref@@ used , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and impressive debts , families who were dism@@ issed by divi@@ ding workers , workers who were un@@ just dischar@@ ged - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the federal government will be charged by 30 percent , which means thousands of the need@@ y people from Queens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call on the generations of the Federal Republic and the Federal Minister of Federal Minister , and the Sen@@ ators of Queens@@ land George Bran@@ dis , so that these medi@@ ators will immediately stand up immediately , so people who need help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government met its commitment to up@@ lift funds for legal assess@@ ments on the national level . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to look at the needs of the community centres and their client , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey on countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) , and Berlin ( 18 September ) , significant losses resulting from the SPD parties and CD@@ U . &quot;
this took representative surveys for the oppos@@ ing institu@@ tion@@ ist IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental Co@@ alition could be far@@ ther ahead of the north , this is not possible after renov@@ ations in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and had a good chances to continue to face the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD stor@@ med by 35,@@ 6 percent five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the party l@@ lows therefore only just before the CD@@ U which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is contro@@ versi@@ al between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left fighters on 19 percent ( previously 18,@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
the Gre@@ ens despite slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8,@@ 7 percent ) again into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the agricultural day .
&quot; at the Berlin pu@@ ties , the SPD of the survey was only increased to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the de@@ pu@@ ties , for the first time . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came into the market .
the followers domin@@ ate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half kil@@ ograms and was more than vi@@ erm@@ al as hard as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thick@@ er and bigger , therefore it was not good in hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty kno@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ aby@@ te , that would be enough today for about two selection of high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ aby@@ te .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in business - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the equipment even on the internet , but they somehow date from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ net Age . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish cell@@ ular phone manufacturers had announced the product a few months ago at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover as &quot; office in the west section . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for dam@@ p standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers if also qu@@ itting .
a calculator was available to a digital book book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; rather proud of the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , therefore about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was about 392 euros .
nobody could imagine in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the cell @-@ card of the fin@@ s experienced a be@@ is@@ pi@@ ous disaster , was eventually sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market today domin@@ ate suppliers , which were all a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
in 2015 there were almost two billion Smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1,@@ 4 billion devices made by Samsung and Apple are alone 555 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the devices is roughly 400 billion euros .
&quot; to do so , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and the telecommunications company will come . &quot;
around the smartphone has now been developed an entire industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple announces Steve Jobs at the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the winner of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market . &quot;
it finally disappeared to fight Black@@ berry .
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its in@@ vention a well @-@ compreh@@ en@@ sible .
in the cut each German today looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; we must all learn to set the smartphone , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens @-@ Management Board responsible for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a cur@@ se and blessing at the same time .
England must move the ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row is not only given to our local Commun@@ ists and throughout London but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity .
&quot; for me , it presented the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ rows , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we operated a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will reach again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already alone 10,000 new apprentic@@ eships , 40@@ ,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment at the airport . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ ath@@ rows is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will blo@@ cking ourselves on the world stage .
the two @-@ fl@@ er had been inj@@ usti@@ ce in 2012 and they are also false in He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any questions asked . &quot;
like the Olympic Games is He@@ ath@@ row for many and not for single infra@@ structural projects .
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to leave the airport and to all the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have spent a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in consequence of the world &apos;s best airports was built up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequ@@ ented run walks of the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the extension of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time that we bro@@ aden this ol@@ ymp@@ ic spirit and create He@@ ath@@ row as well as our future trading and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz @-@ und Maus@@ er &quot; &quot; for viewing @-@ blo@@ cking &quot;
&quot; for companies , those with online @-@ making money come according to one of the software manufacturer &apos;s tests , display blo@@ cking blo@@ ating to handle , a &quot; k@@ atz@@ ing and mouse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad @-@ lo@@ dges on his desktop page , published Ad@@ block Plus a blog@@ post , in which it mitt@@ ent that users could update their filters in the program to blo@@ cking again in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook share with that its desktop page would change the coding of the coding for his advertisements to display it , which part of the page advertising is to sc@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; but ad@@ block declare that there is a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a b@@ log@@ post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle is already underway since the in@@ vention of sco@@ op@@ ters in progress , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has turned into battle for social media , is a powerful indicator of how wor@@ rying sco@@ op@@ ters have become the industry . &quot;
&quot; in the world , according to a study from the last year of Pag@@ ef@@ air , and Adobe around 200 million people are using advertisers ; almost vi@@ erm@@ al so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 19 billion daily users , which access Facebook via their mobile devices , makes Hand@@ y@@ advertising 84 percent of the value @-@ value fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has not aside the ad block on desktop PCs as mobile ad block , no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ agram , divided an speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient large proportion of the recei@@ pts , so on Facebook the investment of such a stri@@ de appears as rewar@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be &quot; &quot; ad pre@@ paid &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook , that add@@ ling new filters were wor@@ rying because they are also blo@@ cking content on the site that no advertising are . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not constitute a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared an speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; indicator block are a bl@@ unt remedy , which is why we have concentrated on development tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over the hands of people . &quot;
women with alleg@@ ed su@@ ic@@ ide on Swiss motorway over@@ drive
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday during a supposed su@@ ic@@ ide by several vehicles on a highway over@@ drive .
the inci@@ dent took place on the A1 near Morges in the cant@@ on of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is evident that a silence at the age of 49 years , which was driven by several vehicles , including a trucks , over@@ drive itself . &quot;
it died on site .
&quot; several drivers have been heard already , but some are still not yet identified , the police told these as well as any witness to the inci@@ dent to contact them . &quot;
&quot; it was opened a investigation procedure , what a &quot; log@@ istic &quot; step in such a situation is , divided G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Trib@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avoi@@ dable ?
&quot; this is something what the prosec@@ ut@@ or has to decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the past five years show that the drivers will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - when a person on the Dark On@@ es ran out - was decided that the mot@@ orists not going to assume that a pedestrian immersed in the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year was acqu@@ itted a polic@@ eman of the neg@@ ligent pottery , after they had a man over and killed in August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year victims had dr@@ unk , and has become un@@ conscious on the road , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the judgment presented that the Poli@@ z@@ ist -- which had responded to a not@@ ebook -- in an justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road had an &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able situation &quot; , &quot; said the Ju@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information on the inci@@ dent in the Thursday near Morges , should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 644 83 46 or 0@@ 21 644 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ amo@@ del : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus was probably once again ind@@ ent to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies : NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms to identify with clim@@ bers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water @-@ free surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once experienced was rep@@ lied . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained through their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slow down . &quot;
the model lighted also the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to hide life and before quicker . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ ited also from a sun that was 30 percent of value .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow conversion of Venus is almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which seems like a rain@@ bow in order to settle the surface of a large part of the sun . &quot;
&quot; the result are average @-@ temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than those of the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resem@@ bles the evolution previously assumed by planetary research .
&quot; although they were probably crow@@ ned , Venus was exposed over the course of several billion years --@@ much heat and ultr@@ avi@@ olet light . &quot;
your oceans conce@@ de and her water@@ bed was burned from the ultr@@ avi@@ olet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen escap@@ ed , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a de@@ adly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today . &quot;
researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .

&quot; in the course of the summer long and I think about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .

we appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy was awarded during his debut in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of Jack Adam@@ s Awards as the best coach of the League .

Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the ast@@ er@@ fur@@ s of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler @-@ space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ y , the completed catalog of rot@@ ary rates among the stars of the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the observ@@ atory can be seen at different levels , as well as in what context are the rot@@ ational periods of the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience the compar@@ isons of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a re@@ searcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 445 Light@@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constell@@ ations have emerged from around 125 million years ago , now adults can reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it is now turning the fastest .
on top @-@ peak rates en@@ ligh@@ ten the deep@@ ening star large amounts of stars .
&quot; since these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars , they have a br@@ ink effect on the stars . &quot;
when a star alter@@ t it begins to slow@@ down his rotation rate .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each ster@@ ns by taking the time between the show of a recogni@@ z@@ able star@@ ques -- like sun@@ spots -- recognis@@ es .
the newest catalogue of rot@@ ary rates points out that massive stars are s@@ lower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers in which larger stars are turning more slowly than smaller .
&quot; in the &quot; Bal@@ let &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors to be ten@@ ds to be solid , weigh@@ ed up quicker rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades so close is , it serves as ideal Kos@@ mis@@ tic lab to compare qualities as rot@@ ary rates . &quot;
&quot; the observ@@ atory of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much of us what we would like to know more about how , w@@ ann and why stars slow@@ down their rot@@ ary rates and add their &quot; dance gloves &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in three times , in detail about their newest analysis of the rot@@ ary rates of the P@@ lei@@ aden , will soon be reported in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

also his far@@ ewell days do not run smo@@ ked .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legen@@ ds in their last games have once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to be sitting at the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include any far@@ ewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; estimated Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are first den@@ ial accidents
&quot; know : because of a positive no@@ zzle test , weight@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio do not start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dos@@ ages .
a ignor@@ ant ath@@ l@@ ete could have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh year , the first official d@@ op@@ ost@@ s have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swim@@ mer@@ in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish weight@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski have been positive tested in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the start of the already critical op@@ tic competitions , these messages come to time . &quot;
&quot; for Ch@@ en was already proven in the last Sunday the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de , which is used as mascul@@ ine means for d@@ op@@ ing@@ sub@@ instances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ sman CAS confirmed the Friday afternoon with its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took place the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0@@ .04 seconds , they missed the Bron@@ cem@@ e@@ da@@ ille . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to take part in the fo@@ oth@@ es about 50 m of fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ rehear@@ sal in the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter of &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ sman CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the sanctuary of the ath@@ l@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio sick@@ le the news about the positive test at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; explained the lightweight . &quot;
according to the report it is supposed to act at the ban substance around the blo@@ d@@ op@@ ing@@ ian EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ owa was rec@@ ted for provisional , according to B@@ NT shall also have the B @-@ rehear@@ sal already positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ w gathered together with criticism in Ath@@ amas .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the ath@@ l@@ ete do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many are already excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , about all the weight@@ lif@@ ter from the chron@@ ically d@@ op@@ ed nation may not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case of Adrian Ziel@@ inski &apos; was also known , the London Olympi@@ ast@@ eger in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive on the an@@ abo@@ le ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both asp@@ iring the intake , both may not start in class until 94 kg . &quot;
in front of the start of the fri@@ ght the case Dan@@ ek@@ owa is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport .
&quot; the World Association I@@ A@@ AF , the entire Russian team had to start up to an exception for system@@ atic D@@ op@@ ings the start prohibited , even the lung in Kenya produces numerous bad news . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the former verses also had taken care of in China for he@@ f@@ ty disputes between the athletes . &quot;

&quot; when I see the po@@ dium about 200 m Fre@@ est@@ l , I want to pass myself , &quot; says H@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the center of a debate with the Austr@@ ali@@ er M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for mental sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested in 2014 at the Chinese champ@@ ion@@ ships , had been tested positive at the stim@@ ul@@ ans tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month locking . &quot;

programmers from ground@@ ing @-@ mal@@ ware is currently targeted companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware @-@ Ab@@ wehr specialist Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , the UK and Germany were 40 percent of the surv@@ ey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months at least once , partly several victims of an attack with Er@@ pres@@ ser software . &quot;
in Germany just 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion .
40 percent of the victims would be will@@ ingly prepared by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors demanded by the perpet@@ rat@@ ors to use the systems and data over again .
the perpet@@ rat@@ ors speci@@ alize their arous@@ ed software according to the observations of mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; they are successful in it , the potentially gri@@ pping sol@@ der falls considerably higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying quick evolution of damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief of Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then you discovered the perpet@@ r@@ ator software for itself .
&quot; first , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was fright@@ ening rapidly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware works in a simple pattern : once on the computer of an O@@ pf@@ ile , she is looking forward to im@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files en@@ coded the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware and delet@@ es the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
then the software presents the demands of the pres@@ pres@@ ser .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to get the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ck Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where with private users the personal photo @-@ database on the game stands , it goes to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off if a re@@ ans@@ om@@ ware fails . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies increased sales growth by R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware , 13 percent even had to fully interru@@ pt the business operations , in a case of people were living in life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by loss of trau@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays off , it only promotes the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult , in view of breast@@ feeding the demand of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors of the perpet@@ rat@@ ors . &quot;
the h@@ acker again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure the user surfaces and contact with the results are examined , and come to the result : the perpet@@ rat@@ ors actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you declare their sacrific@@ es by chat , as they can pay by bit@@ coin , freely accessible Support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and will not rede@@ emed private persons after payments of a few hund@@ red@@ t Euro , companies must have partly hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit sums have to be returned to their data . &quot;
&quot; considering the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and share the work , explains safety experts Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of the Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sophos : &quot; a single person can write a R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmer sell their damage software then in the form of a software design to the actual replacement .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware Kits made by the Mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a adapt@@ able ool , so smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the ex@@ pres@@ ser then look for further h@@ ackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log@@ ically in one of the forums in the substr@@ ate , purchases the set by a crime and asked for another to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is eff@@ ected per in@@ infected computer .
&quot; usually put the crimin@@ als then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware &apos;s risk is known by many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey strongly rely on the R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors are already pursu@@ ing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data is not a sufficient threat to successful testing , threat@@ ening the perpet@@ rat@@ ors instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ecz@@ yn@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , the damage potential , depending on the type of data is still a multi@@ disciplinary higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rat@@ ors will continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things on the cor@@ n . &quot;
&quot; on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con presented security for@@ scher , as they could connect to the Internet using the Internet Thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of a der@@ art block such man@@ chem victims could really be a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpet@@ rat@@ ors then instead of heating in the future a whole production line in a factory block , R@@ ans@@ om@@ ware might also be an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all@@ eless
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack all : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ p@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ ature . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was built on the same new platform such as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works very small , passengers have a lot of space for the first row as well as in the fo@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work comfortably , only the cock@@ pit @-@ upper side falls down there . &quot;
versatile as comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage box .
&quot; there is not only a suit@@ case of 453 l for high @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l on inver@@ ted back back@@ ups , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the sitting area of the back@@ rests can be tor@@ tured and thus offer storage spaces , which is high from the ground up to the blan@@ kets 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk @-@ luggage is well bel@@ low , but the loading height of 650 mm is higher than with the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.@@ 6 @-@ l diesel for 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he might appeal to his work somewhat more quiet . &quot;

two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are lying under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something aw@@ k@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped Top @-@ Diesel are in order .
&quot; who will not want to invest so much , get the petrol station from 200@@ 00 Euro , the Diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;

&quot; after their journey , we only get money back when the cause of the disease is undoubtedly found in the hotel . &quot;

&quot; on week@@ days , the return to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way , and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle valve on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Street .
&quot; from here , traffic can only be bought on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be restored in the three @-@ quarter years .
the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had given that the bridge no longer possesses the required load @-@ power to absor@@ b especially the heavy traffic @-@ pur@@ ging .
&quot; how long this Eng@@ pass , and the associated fe@@ eder may last will not say , the competent authorities can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official rest@@ u@@ ity to the year 2034 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal tender , the state @-@ operation has been aware of the v@@ eil of time in the school holidays because with disabilities is to be reck@@ oned . &quot;
the traffic is guided on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .

rain instead of ast@@ er@@ is@@ ions : hope of weather rep@@ airing
the weather has made the star@@ ters in the south @-@ west of Germany during the night to Friday - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night is due to clouds and rain bad for it , the heavenly spectac@@ le to observe , said the president of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Fri@@ day@@ tomorrow . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many star@@ ters in the sky . &quot;
&quot; at the star@@ ters , it is about pers@@ one that belong to the fastest star@@ ters per hour to the fastest star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they seem to come from the constell@@ ation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes on the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against ins@@ om@@ nia
&quot; in the evening , one gets etern@@ ally around , at night it is long night aw@@ ake , in the morning it is far ahead of the W@@ eck@@ er@@ kl@@ es no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute has approximately a quarter of adults dormitory , and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanent as not rest@@ ful . &quot;
how do sleep problems or dis@@ cord ?
&quot; there are several forms of sle@@ e@@ ons , and there can be diverse causes underlying , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aver , prefer@@ ing member of the German Society for dormitory and dormitory . &quot;
&quot; what one understands in under@@ line , but is the In@@ som@@ atic , therefore an input and a le@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; straight to sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , says Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , pre@@ mier@@ ed in the German house physician association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of ins@@ om@@ nia are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psych@@ ic or durable factors , but also medicines . &quot;
it is not sel@@ dom the sleeping @-@ disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early w@@ aking up is mainly among depression frequently , &quot; says We@@ ars . &quot;
and it can be that various factors may cause each other .
&quot; for example , who has a stre@@ amer . he can lie badly , w@@ acht every two to three hours and starts bl@@ iss@@ ful , about everyday problems and worry about p@@ onder@@ ing , there is stretched an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
&quot; when , when to sleep with ins@@ ular disorders ? &quot;
&quot; who is not as@@ le@@ ased about a period of a month at least three nights per week , and the day it should be affected , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ air@@ ment may vary completely different : one is be@@ aten , tired , un@@ circum@@ cis@@ ed , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has voting pregnant or physical discomfort such as stomach or he@@ ada@@ che . &quot;
&quot; to alle@@ vi@@ ate the dysfunction , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , such behaviour changes , a cog@@ nitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping @-@ paper only in the exceptional and most suitable for two weeks - question . &quot;
&quot; Nieder@@ gel@@ ass@@ ene Schlaf@@ practitioner is in Germany almost , st@@ resses Prof. Ingo Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary and medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore one should contact sleeping @-@ problems at first , in the house @-@ office , &quot;
&quot; this can be clari@@ fied with investigations , whether the problems have a bodi@@ ly cause . &quot;
&quot; who should in dormitory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; to study in dormitory rates of medical practitioner , for example in snor@@ ing with respir@@ atory reasons , in case of illness or if one does not find the cause of a lack of sleeping , explained Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you do not need to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the seller you go to his normal time in bed .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des at the body there is a nas@@ al glasses , a chest strap and a f@@ itter at the finger . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a camera will draw on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers have the problems in the handle wars ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws on which one can put for a better sleep .
&quot; it counts upon : regular sleeping and down@@ time , not too long in bed , not sleeping in bed , not watching TV to sleep , alcohol to avoid the and night not at the clock - then we will start to count , and that is entirely non @-@ condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medalli@@ ons in swimming has
the former German swim@@ mer Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed itself on Facebook for dis@@ appoint@@ ing the D@@ SV teams on Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time in December 2014 and presented at the same time his first world record .
now the former D@@ SV @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler on Facebook have been placed in the cri@@ tique of the ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where an Olympi@@ ast@@ eger 20,000 € award gets and a jungle king 150@@ .000 € should nobody wonder@@ ing about missing medalli@@ ons , &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming @-@ sport is bad , the d@@ op@@ ing@@ controls is very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries which do not promote a lot and do not operate as accurate and even operate on the issue of doping . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls are to be adjusted here , &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ doping agency Deutschland ( N@@ ada ) . &quot;
this is how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; who cannot be controlled a certain time before World Cup / OS by independent control structures of the W@@ ada / fin@@ a , must not take part , &quot; &quot; requested the choice of Hamburg , who has now operates a ice cream . &quot;
airport : Ban@@ de von baggage allowance
professional di@@ ebe at the airport Düsseldorf
civi@@ liz@@ ations of the dis@@ sert@@ ation of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police w@@ ang on Thursday the capture of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ab@@ ia had committed as a ban@@ de several tor@@ - and saddle stit@@ ching .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 pm , civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf is a ban@@ de back , which was known for the police most recent theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ik@@ te since the mid July of this year , were meant to be a collaborative effort and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the criminal @-@ ab@@ ari@@ ats 34 can justi@@ fy the diver@@ gence of criminal off@@ ences towards Germany , four acts of action . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had a total of over 15@@ .000 euros . &quot;
&quot; renov@@ ations , a few Lin@@ den@@ b@@ äum@@ chen , just like a rema@@ inder street in Berlin @-@ peac@@ rich@@ sha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from east to west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a refres@@ hing kinder@@ garten and a be@@ ads . &quot;
to the façade of a gray house someone has spra@@ yed ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; opposite from a Li@@ dl that will also be dem@@ ol@@ ished soon , it will be built here : until 2017 here is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; tr@@ endy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate agency fried@@ rich@@ sha@@ in , however , will be pre@@ viewed with burning cars in the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of the lease , on the ground floor are still rooms open and used for events . &quot;
&quot; especially of the Berlin cycl@@ sen@@ ator H@@ enkel , since the beginning of the year has been repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ smi@@ thy , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol , the police were three weeks long , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , bol@@ ted parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ known house owners the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on July 13 , a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance had been illegal , and one day later went to police and buil@@ ders under the jewels of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the home projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left violence is not the main care of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the p@@ ans since 1999 , and Jana * , which are mostly driven here three children , mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house@@ wife , they share the concern of rising mi@@ xes and gr@@ ac@@ ation . &quot;
it sounds not according to a p@@ ines which were mostly her@@ edit@@ ary polic@@ emen in front of the left hand .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which of the Berlin inter@@ sen@@ ator and the police have set up between households and their neighbors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; peaceful workers in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker &apos;s quarter , which today also has a lower average of the city and the high poverty of poverty . &quot;
&quot; also domestic flights , and the resulting resi@@ dences have been in a long way to the Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former G@@ DR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer street very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the main@@ akers had been vac@@ ated under a large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ aer and are partly inhabited by the people that they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and elect@@ oral liner from all over the world , with them now share wives from the G@@ DR times and former house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the mi@@ tig@@ ations , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ aer are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them on wr@@ apped discs or fresh@@ ly stri@@ pped fac@@ ades created with colour exploited .
&quot; this year , no other street was mentioned as often with the words &quot; &quot; lin@@ ks@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason that not all neighbours could see that as a problem may not necessarily be affected by crime : criminal off@@ ences such as bodi@@ ly injury are conducted in almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the off@@ ences make damage , which ten@@ ds more likely to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the contro@@ versi@@ al 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; what it goes , is they conf@@ essi@@ vely : the people in the 94 are their neighbours that are not intended . &quot;
&quot; also , the famous burning cars do not give it directly in the Rig@@ aer already longer . &quot;
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a cid burning point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other with , than wo@@ anders . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved to the Riga street - and remained intact .
&quot; that &apos;s why it was also so important that the inhabitants returned their road : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly appeared in July all the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to lead to them : by soci@@ able re@@ constructions in former buildings , which d@@ rank the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; they are ultimately con@@ dom@@ ini@@ ums who are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well covered , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not meet them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should you do , if any one never list@@ ened ? &quot;
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides fru@@ stration , even in the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for conc@@ gens that anno@@ ying themselves about colour bom@@ bs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belon@@ ged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who pul@@ led , should be aware - just like anyone who draws up into a pub that can complain too bad about noise . &quot;
all persons provided only with pre@@ names have asked to be called not named with their right names
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka De@@ us@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organization .
&quot; in addition , it is a social @-@ worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka De@@ usch@@ le the refuge@@ e commissioned for Ur@@ bach .
the social pe@@ dagog@@ ics supports the team of management at Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working circle refuge@@ e assistance , administration , authorities and who else else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that De@@ us@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ver of w@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so some - less sp@@ ott@@ ous as rather on the variety of active tasks are targeted - meant , when the administration wanted to write . &quot;
&quot; search@@ ed for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people , connected with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , even a remote @-@ heart@@ ed w@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka De@@ us@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first of all , it comes to organization , work with the local people and also behind the scenes , as well as networks . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for around six weeks .
it has a 50 percent place to free@@ ze three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka De@@ us@@ le honor@@ ary and put@@ ty actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and constitu@@ ent problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße
&quot; serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting people who have been recognized . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential spaces .
the cost of construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ a to the Commun@@ e and the Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search have been designed for some time as a very difficult one .
de fac@@ to find the administration of private apartments .
&quot; so far not , it is not working on a private apartments , so De@@ us@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , non @-@ profit apartments have to be kept as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are placed in the W@@ as@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka De@@ us@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed b@@ undle , it is train@@ e@@ eships , training courses , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pl@@ ess activities for refugees and migrants who have been fallen or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help household handling , do @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka De@@ us@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community has lead to a positive external power .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but activity does not mean work .
the day need a fixed structure , say De@@ us@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a belonging .
&quot; so , there are offers such as sport , contacts with locals and especially Spanish courses . &quot;
professional courses are r@@ ar .
&quot; so , also here administration and volunteer . &quot;
&quot; it is central that refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can change the time useful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who some@@ time the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone who will not work and be unn@@ üt@@ z , who will never incorporate them . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there is also , customer says honest , &quot; people where nothing goes . &quot; the work of De@@ us@@ le and customer is therefore always motiv@@ ate others to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; this is all already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what do na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; could call &quot; &quot; a Rest@@ or@@ iko could not close . &quot;
we have to sensi@@ ti@@ zed the hel@@ pers but already .
these inci@@ dents were also the topic among the refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely into ob@@ itu@@ ary .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would love to stay at Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and volunteer is to keep place on site and in the region according to activities . &quot;
they always have in the background that soon a new Sto@@ cks of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
need Germany a upper limit ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , it n@@ oses the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to face them on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are still not there , where we want , &quot; says Anni@@ ka De@@ mat@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees who would relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher will also already trigger to incorporate reasonable , to previous people . &quot;
&quot; these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them are both women . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : in@@ ventions with hel@@ icop@@ ters
the police @-@ Hel@@ icopter fle@@ w around one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men can be rolled in the Fri@@ day@@ morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in Lin@@ den@@ weg .

&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 15 meters tall , probably masks , tru@@ sts both Blue@@ je@@ ans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
they tails in the middle of the city .
&quot; for the ground@@ ing , the police declared several strike , as well as a police driver . &quot;
the flag ran without success .
&quot; perhaps , the unknown before the apartment or her escape . &quot;
