<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and to prevent trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policies between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state is over the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubts more small and warned against it, as the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton Wool the economy to death on death and regulate to death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively drive regulators, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax sets strong - for private craftsmen and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand says: the state has certain duties to fulfill, he has given a disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase for the rich, she says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in the mts, Trump and Clinton will be fast."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants still announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state Teapy-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump there may be so many internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">"clearly, the differences in energy and climate policies."</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-power plants and set the cohesion in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil Sources should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"on the other hand, Clinton wants to build and encourage renewable energies with its investment program:" "a country will create the clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only at the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two rivals are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazifish trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both do not want to isolate the United States from international trade, but just to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hunger chicken.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it on 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump is to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must click, then he says he might not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months should probably be likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand Trump, who wants to entail the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are holding it before and thus the budgetdeficit would only be larger.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand Clinton, the Clinton is at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and their critics are saying, more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="14">"it is the area leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offers in Bavaria, and deals among other things with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are feared.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Münchner north in one of the few decentralized accommodations for all-owned women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs had set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>

<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has done on their escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men escape because of wars, because they become politically prosecuted, because they post torture or death or because their families send them as hopelists to Europe, tells them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women overthrew other reasons for the flight:" "many steal themselves secretly, because they do not see any other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, compulsive, volunteers, slavery, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This continues its driving.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it continues.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs to demand for a bottle of water is a sexual act, is not rarity, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end once they came into Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"also here, the women involved in refugee accommodations often regarded as inferior and hardest if abuse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to about 90 percent of women, who live in the residence in the Münchner north, traumatised, appreciates it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used that they do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't get to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not help, need more accommodation only for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District rules are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"whether they feel like a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, reply some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are something about governments not."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, women are not accommodated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Spokesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Unter- and mid-franken there are in some common accommodation floors or own homes only for all women and their children. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it is said:" "it is very important that men and women are being separated."</seg>

<seg id="46">"especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as very the women feel this protection, one can read at the congestion that there is on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outside parties"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to present their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>

<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also spoke that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>

<seg id="11">Me seemed like his enthusiasm to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable coolness showed that the State-ef of Russia had nothing to be forgotten."</seg>

<seg id="16">"this even was even bigger, since it was committed by a mine friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Chewing to re-establish is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media led a fierce, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed to be the door to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious officials were the accusations of leadership officials, that Erdogan's own family has benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria that have been controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but at St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look at the front."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received from the President Erdogan to the excuse he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the benefits of a cease-fire is clearly obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan needs all the friends who can get it, after it has been enthralled almost his ministry for the last month."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repetitive terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him too.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agency and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are taken up again."</seg>

<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulate it following:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry to the West since its reaction was to tried to take power over a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued Groll come across the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pipiers to pull off the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian state-ef win in Ankara with certainty a bonus for it, that he called for the tried coup-rich support for the chosen state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, self-comprehensible, which has itself a deep-sitting fear of regime."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this splendid palace close to the sea, made it Russia and Turkey, one like it was once described an analyst," Alliance of external side ": two countries that come across from west and treat poorly."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two still."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently presented the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey left opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be punished, that after almost three hours at first talks, both Presidents at the press conference told that they had not yet attained the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey would like to answer a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in light of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO member of Turkey the Russian martial jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State was at least once again talk."</seg>

<seg id="21">"but the official allegation - that a man who was once a potential president, which would lead to once again the Russian environmental policy - came across great skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who are quoted on the website of the Kremlin, said Ivanov" it is true that I asked you to trust this very complicated post in 2012 - you could almost say - complaining about four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turned out, I have been Chairman of the Russian presiding board for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and such as Putin former member of the state-security of KGB.</seg>

<seg id="2">A british travel underwent his immune system and worgereflex by a serious test - by taking some of the most lubrication and ekelest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, his course on a Euro-Schein, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a dishwasher of a draw toilette as well as a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the check-out every object, he used a Luminous to show up and show us what he will leave."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment that was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength "," brought some surprising results in daylight. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the flushing of a draw toilette, which was already used by thousands of others, may really be repulsive, but actually are in a kitchen spinning more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to physicians and medical specialists about the support of intestine bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he pines, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known for testing the resilience of his intestine by teasing it through the world and ate, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to dishwashes of toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely under a sample</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" as a child I was relatively unworried about what my health concerns and I put all the possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was given his reputation in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he reableed was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proverabed showed a Luminometernumber of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison with this, the Luminometerisation is expected to be less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he escaped himself, after their Luminometernumber over 4000 units was, while freshly adjusted hands one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the Reisefile" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," "this comes the worst, what I had in a toilet, near."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will see nothing here, because it is here inside."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company is our Lord Wright with Valio Gefilus, which provides both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the support of intestine bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Validity Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says," "we wanted the consumer really something new to offer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that's intriguing to the sight and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we led crazy Brainstormings by that so that we said," Let us call us Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information about an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, which led the direction of the film, added:" let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, when he had made my respect for Ian that I have loved him, just like the ekelous Russian toilet, which will be shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things that it was simpler to bring Ian to bringing them, and others, where this was pretty difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we have recorded some of these dirty leweries on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of validation conducted survey from the year 2015 affiliated 84 percent of all responsive military bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they are at least occasionally products, the attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="1">"Destination records: who are actually buy record plates,?"</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of the middle age love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to the commentary, in order to betray him under the pseudonym non-aging men with rough exposure to sooths, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov is the multi-free trial of record, not on a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the realism of physical objects but on Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently bought a record are all pre-view at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through Hobbycollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older platters reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But vote the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while I keep in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble anew and wild, before I stand up, my hands and tell something like:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let us take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart Sohos is slowly moving to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings, where the once independent seller were resident - there are still a handful fantastic."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I set by Sister Ray (data: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle age, a woman, presumably for the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already cherish," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed up at home) to dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a substantial number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when they appeared and again objects that he sold as he was young and plet."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I bought, are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I probably was something young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend alone time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I drink not much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the mediaspe people who have heard about the comeback, and let's see their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the conversations that I have led, people usually have done so about 1998 or 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the Boom of trailers of a record in a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the inadequate emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica, to recognize that record shops has a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers took part in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound separators, of objects, the happy youth-innerosion."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is as a collectors so I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" kills a staff of a record-stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April unveiled that almost 50% of the people who bought a record, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player which they never use, while 7% of those who bought a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the message report I would probably look very concerned while I forgot through a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (data number: three men of the middle age) has noticed a" Trophy "of Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came just recently here and said:" I do not have a record player, but I would like to buy a radihead, so I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely going."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-laszable, less music-clasps."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people, who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older who are only slowly coming."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted the record nearly a whole floor, has a blower audience than I set."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle age."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-standing shops, - Wild Before, Synthesizer, pop, instead of experimental jazz drillers from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks lonely lonely lonely but nail psychic traumata are hard to conceivable if one stands next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes in business and considers the variation of the sale standing for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to make a manorum bumblebee as a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates cannot be a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way but the beauty of plates is... they drive with a loving seufzer.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it is really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, by which is said that a new generation of record-makers have been inspired: urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the sunshine, the jeans Hotpants to patterns, watching a group of young teenager cameras, watching a father and daughter to buy a cross-record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks like them - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to put them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is a pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury resistances such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my reforgeries agree that the results of YouGov votes, let them, at least in sheet-shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-loving who exist in reality, juices, and in Onlineforen, unconsidered."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the Bumble by turnaround of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they provoke the rigid look of an uncanny, 30-year wrong presenter, which inflraged over the shoulders of the middle age."</seg>

<seg id="8">Through regular interrelations you can weaving social contacts and maintain.</seg>
<seg id="9">"they often solve social and familiar structures at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organise themselves to the others and to learn from one another - a choir is a very special form of co-awareness."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">Because the seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Whoever calls for his lungs in everyday life not as fast as the purest.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it is about to obtain the sound of the voice in the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>

<seg id="20">While at the same time focus on their own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a big cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people who live alone, practice so, not only concentrate on yourself."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the chorus means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem is growing through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I mean long for something, I will get better and watchse through me - this experience reinforces."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to begin with the singing, there is enough."</seg>

<seg id="28">"you don't sings alone - at 50 Singing people, who hear, when a tone goes out of it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the suitable offer seniors various possibilities, says Hackler. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings somebody from the familiarity in a senior choir, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn right to the church or the Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors you can find over the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who has no access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with Internet networks."</seg>

<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partially in the shade are the sports, which are not generally recognized: aviation-shooting, Archery, Badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and let it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but when I might make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia presented to violent resistance of the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses said that venty protesters during the gathering with the police have been killed in a shift.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break up?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid foe of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government against the government and extends over the last few months."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week turbulent thousands of people on the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to the fact that policemen were shot up in zig unpaid protesters.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation to the protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men will show young people with staves, while these were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for human rights is now asking for incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and in future it will even become more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa der International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the populated country of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopia to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands at considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commute in the capital of Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet and safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have constantly led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was limited, whereby dissidents were effective at the silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison or driven into the breadth of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and do not have any other options except protruding, it breaks out," "Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopians."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth are protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover all from the floor to throws up to the throws within the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a large-ently criticised elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"simultaneously, the tensions along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this zacky, controversial line urged in June hundreds of life."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-liberating Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden which could have more or less forced into the past few years and could be reared again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the peration after years of provocate under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, a lot of Ethiopia were able to communicate with the social media, since cheap smartphones have ever been more common and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government bolts access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially with protests, many people can still communicate more about internet proxy-ies which hide themselves."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young people gave them that they were so different to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two biggest ethnics in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prosperous, the Amharas, the Amharas, which come from the Aegean Sea mainly in the politics and the economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and in flatlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen, said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests found in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have dominated the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigray, which are around 6 percent of the population and who are in the military, in the secrecy, in commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebels, was up to his death at a non-known disease in 2012 17 years of Greek prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly diversified in it, early signs of dissatisfaction and special parties to use to edit opponents and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lack this fundamental skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been selected for relatively untimely reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"other than Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region North Ethiopian, comes Lord Hailemariam from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia was a turmoil lived in 2005, after thousands of elections progressed, according to the information of analysts, apparently circulated by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praises the leaders for their visionary infrastructural planning, such as the new commits, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty alleviation."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormative government of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month of the protesters in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray guided businesses and the hatges towards the Tigray is becoming ever more evil in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests and other Western allies put into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenties on the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently refused that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West wants to support democracy clearly, he will not want his foe in an already volatial area collapses."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr. Abdi," "is a very thin grass."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarifies new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clearly and understandable with the American public. "</seg>

<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the excuses completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to weaken him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy it, the republican presidential candid nothing about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism is prasleashed to Mr. Trump, while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign on the economic situation."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton had speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday tried Mr. Trump again to return to this subject.</seg>
<seg id="12">"through Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would cause suggestions to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought its defense to its defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he moved strong criticism against himself when he said, the Russians ought to hate Mrs. Clintons of e-mail, but he later stated" "Natural Now I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the boundaries to politics and then back to the needs.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages from his fans will be recorded as they arrive, and then if appropriate," "says Ruth Sherman, a communication presentation, which the language of both candidates were observed."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of putting the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has taken an even estimated tone since its refrageable."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was published on Friday, showed a leadership with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-at-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally tried to apologize for his provocal expression, he accused his critics frequently to distorted his statements or his humor wrong."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal fellow-streetites into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocant his statements also may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent leaders, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN-interview."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "Mr. Giuliani therefore he asks for the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Mr ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them backwinder, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most Mainstream-Republicans are trying to argued that the government under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an external minister in served, it allowed ISIS to curse themselves by bringing it to the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the electoral events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before, on each of his words, and to be heard against him."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come in winter to the surface.</seg>

<seg id="8">"only when it is arrives, the five meters long animal cuts up 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robur."</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of long-efficacy lifestyle seems to be a patent to be for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science" at any rate of a Greenland, the 392 years old could be. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness, commented Alexander Scheuerans from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this period of life, which means for vertebrates a world record."</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already has long, that Greenland-haie."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only faults the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie are difficult to observe, finally, they mainly live in the ice sea in front of the thin-settled coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface usually only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"about the lifestyle of Greenland-haie, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-out-rebates they, when they are facing the Spitsbergen six animals with a transmitter equipment."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Bemare make these hay nevertheless: in the stomach of a beast, researchers found the remnants of a Robots, another had the maxbones of a young iceberg."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly jars they sleeping animals or patrol illiers at the bottom of the Eismeeres and look for Kadaver that torn from higher water stories after the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland haie, the fisherman between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen and catching from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long while the largest 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, analysing them with the carbon-14-method the ruler of the Haie."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eyelash arises already before the birth of sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had striking much carbon-14 in the linkers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"hence, your birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as nuclear-weapon try larger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimeters length of third animal contained the lens against carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland hay had a normal carbon-14 volumes that arises from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 Zentimeters even 392 years old might be expected."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark will only get offspring, when they are longer than four metres, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers got to subordinate an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably at the threshold of the sexually mature, and his age was appointed with 156 years, the Greenland-hay can obviously at least one-half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be used for vertebrates at the world.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record-holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose speck at the neck a 120 years old Harpoet tip, was captured from Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, often the organism of the animals live there live on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature later - and satin slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to warm up in cold water, the animals are also often especially large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal is heating."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with an gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on how much as possible as many offspring as possible, explains the evolutionary biologist scrublein."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers from grounding-malware is currently targeted companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the Malware-Abwehr specialist Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, the UK and Germany were 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, partly several victims of an attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany just 20 percent of companies have already been the target of a Ransomware extortion.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims would be willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to use the systems and data over again.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their aroused software according to the observations of malwarebytes on attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful in it, the potentially gripping solder falls considerably higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying quick evolution of damage software," explains Malwarebytes chief of Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most MalwarePrograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then you discovered the perpetrator software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was frightening rapidly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works in a simple pattern: once on the computer of an Opfile, she is looking forward to imlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encoded the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the prespresser.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to get the files, the victims need money - usually in the form of Cryptock Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where with private users the personal photo-database on the game stands, it goes to companies about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is breastfeeding."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off if a reansomware fails."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies increased sales growth by Ransomware, 13 percent even had to fully interrupt the business operations, in a case of people were living in life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by loss of trauma."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays off, it only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult, in view of breastfeeding the demand of the perpetrators of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hacker again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study the safety researchers from F-Secure the user surfaces and contact with the results are examined, and come to the result: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you declare their sacrifices by chat, as they can pay by bitcoin, freely accessible Support websites, or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will not redeemed private persons after payments of a few hundredt Euro, companies must have partly hard to negotiate and five-digit sums have to be returned to their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"considering the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware extortion, the hackers are becoming more professional and share the work, explains safety experts Chester Wisniewski of the Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a Ransomware about within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working circle refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the circle indicates that the volunteer is more than thankful that Deusle is now there, the eiver of wmilchsau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so some - less spottous as rather on the variety of active tasks are targeted - meant, when the administration wanted to write."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative force with a talent for languages and people, connected with a long-term experience in the field of social work, even a remote-hearted wmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deusle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, it comes to organization, work with the local people and also behind the scenes, as well as networks."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent place to freeze three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deusle honorary and putty actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and constituent problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting people who have been recognized."</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">The cost of construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities itself. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from Landrata to the Commune and the Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search have been designed for some time as a very difficult one.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto find the administration of private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far not, it is not working on a private apartments, so Deusle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, non-profit apartments have to be kept as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine customer and Annika Deusle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed bundle, it is traineeships, training courses, training courses, one-euro jobs and helpless activities for refugees and migrants who have been fallen or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the Bauhof or help household handling, do-profit work - and the motivates and very neat, like Annika Deusle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community has lead to a positive external power.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day need a fixed structure, say Deusle and customer. "</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so, there are offers such as sport, contacts with locals and especially Spanish courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, also here administration and volunteer."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can change the time useful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who sometime the feeling that he could not help in Urbach anyone who will not work and be unnütz, who will never incorporate them."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there is also, customer says honest," people where nothing goes. "the work of Deusle and customer is therefore always motivate others to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"this is all already a" mammoth task. ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what do naïve" "could call" "a Restoriko could not close."</seg>
<seg id="50">We have to sensitized the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also the topic among the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks they bring them completely into obituary.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay at Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and volunteer is to keep place on site and in the region according to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new Stocks of refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Need Germany a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, it noses the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to face them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are still not there, where we want," says Annika Dematle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees who would relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher will also already trigger to incorporate reasonable, to previous people."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them are both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
