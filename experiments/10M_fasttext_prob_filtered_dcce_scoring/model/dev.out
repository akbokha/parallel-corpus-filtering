Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not straight @-@ friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and to opp@@ ose Teheran &apos;s dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , it is intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ States solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the long @-@ term settlement of Israel and raises the Net@@ any@@ ahu uns@@ atis@@ ing will with the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama to wor@@ sen the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues . &quot;
&quot; in March Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a contro@@ versi@@ al address at the invitation of the Republi@@ can in front of the US Congress , which was used partly as an u@@ pf@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech had not been ref@@ used with Obama , a meeting had been dism@@ issed with a reference to the elections of the election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor , his girlfriend were shot . &quot;
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on &apos;s telling about a somewhat z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , having shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is still lived and probably excited , and he said that family contacts the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials killed the corp@@ se of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , and a hand@@ written note that I didn &apos;t want , I &apos;m sorry I &apos;d love it back , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . this was according to the authority of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he has traveled in two online courses for the Delta State University in C@@ level@@ and , Mississippi , already 300 miles to the school grounds , where he has gone on to the police to have a popular history Professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office and has been killed . &quot;
Delta State University Pol@@ n Bu@@ ford said that Univers@@ es Staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he has made the fat@@ al p@@ opp@@ y at some time after that .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lam@@ b took life , when the police took him into bo@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the University , the students and lec@@ turers that forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped him to record a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers . &quot;
students told that they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , he said , he did not have a history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
he had previously mentioned the book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both set in the department of social sciences and history , whose faculty are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some incl@@ inations to be problematic .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who pra@@ ised , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something with it is wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
I had previously asked the Delta State University to ur@@ ged for health reasons and told that he have some health problem .
this year he was set up only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the employment policy of the university meant that the promotion , for whom &apos;s worked so hard for whom I would not represent a guarantee for an automatic route to an introduction as Assistant @-@ professor . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing of a conflict between husband and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; these are questions , which can no longer be answered . &quot;
&quot; after escape from the campus , the police took place Lam@@ bs Spur , when he returned to Mississippi from Ark@@ ansas . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , killed themselves with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber pi@@ stol in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of its parent home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still going on in the driv@@ eway .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
I grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 he started his work at the university , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and he has managed Ge@@ ography and pe@@ dagog@@ y . &quot;
he gradu@@ ated in the spring of pe@@ dagog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friend@@ bs Lam@@ bs awarded him as intelligent , char@@ is@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lam@@ b was 20 , when they met by joint friends . &quot;
&quot; they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to contribute to the guitar game . &quot;
he was black and black at that time .
&quot; all girls then mel@@ ted when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
he &apos;s and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; I said to my wife &apos;s call &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , but there was no judgment at a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house , which is at a ba@@ you in Gau@@ pet . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; former former husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , she was 15 years ago divor@@ ced , but friends were stayed and a daughter had been 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the floor , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he was interested in music and blues playing . &quot;
he met Pr@@ enti@@ ss as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail three years ago both on a summer fair .
later they played together the one or another gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and s@@ ings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .

there were no signs for anything that was not coinci@@ ded .
&quot; just a Happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the meeting and j@@ et@@ ched together .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of con@@ ry . &quot;

8 rpm values indicate that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to see him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the upper ranks at Poll@@ s , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the two @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mog@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
none asser@@ ted that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the re@@ publi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts empha@@ size that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the ascending the rising Herman C@@ ain , one of whom only one state won in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but outside groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conserv@@ ative economic group Club for Growth now recogni@@ zing Tru@@ mp@@ s stamina and begin to leave their dollar to pl@@ unge it .
here are some recent revers@@ ed values that suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp@@ s Pop@@ ular values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ da@@ cy center June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
to mid July it were 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
now six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
a qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa has noticed that 60 percent of re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; two of them say they would be &quot; angry , &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm like Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; v@@ s. 40 percent , which tell the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm .
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters that they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if everyone was Bush , the favorite of the E@@ stab@@ lish@@ ment , the Candi@@ date . &quot;
a majority of re@@ public@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp@@ s temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for its bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters that the real estate of Mo@@ gu@@ l has had the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is true in the first pre @-@ elect@@ oral state of the nation , the federal state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a comm@@ ander . according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; still 44 percent , that he did not have the personality to perform effectively his ministry , and almost six out of 10 articles that its temper@@ ament is not at the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; if they susp@@ ect their money , re@@ publi@@ can voters d@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when they are asked , who wins at the most est the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say after a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four of ten that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten end of July you put money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past had not the most clear cryst@@ all@@ ine deficiency .
&quot; at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans , that Rick Perry would win the nom@@ ination with only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , shows that a large number of GO@@ P @-@ weighing Tru@@ mp@@ s campaign can be seen as pl@@ au@@ si@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; even if the re@@ public@@ ans meet other candidates , Tru@@ mp still strikes almost everybody . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the sh@@ ake field probably contribute to Tru@@ mp@@ s leadership , while the anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is spread more than a dozen other candidate diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tru@@ mp and most other re@@ publi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp har@@ v@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; he did before Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , especially Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ themselves and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ at @-@ head with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who pro@@ poses it ?
Ben Car@@ son would exceed the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
Donald &apos;s majority of Donald @-@ Tru@@ mp fans says that they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of CB@@ S / NY@@ SE on Tuesday shows that only somewhat more than half of the voters to support Tru@@ mp , say that they have awarded their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , it can happen much to change that , and no one can really say , never change my mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp@@ s is strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ der , the neuro@@ surge@@ on Ben Car@@ son , but voters that they have formed their opinion are twice as frequent for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp in his election campaign ago was released from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and fishing point of public dis@@ course . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of Tru@@ mp is crucial h@@ isp@@ ano Americans from the Republi@@ can party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post @-@ survey from Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans that they agree with Tru@@ mp on matters of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long , the immigration in the spotlight is hidden , it will seem to do Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government clim@@ bed to new peak .
&quot; at Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , by half the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by its out@@ si@@ der status . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ ags survey of ABC / Post , they rather want a political out@@ si@@ der as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloom@@ berg in I@@ owa shows two weeks ago that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent .

Müller was awarded his 28th matches in the Champions League for Bavaria leadership of Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which made one as the f@@ lange covered shot of the cosmos .
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate it , he had promised Germany @-@ captain Philipp l@@ ah@@ m in front of the game in Kar@@ ay k@@ ak@@ is Stadium in front of 31.@@ 688 of hot @-@ blo@@ o@@ ded fans - and the mou@@ ths held . &quot;

&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europe @-@ up du@@ els were un@@ defe@@ ated with Greek teams , nor did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they cour@@ ageous it ran out with their off@@ ensi@@ vely effort but often to einf@@ all@@ ess to works .
the attacks have often been led by play@@ shi@@ fting to Link@@ sau@@ ces Douglas Costa surrounded by the former Braun@@ er Om@@ ar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had to turn right again from the right as its flan@@ ges from the right semi @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 67@@ th minute there was the champion of the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .

then by direct acceptance the go@@ alie Roberto with the kne@@ es par@@ ked ( 35@@ . ) .
&quot; although Bavaria bears the usual dominant game , he could reti@@ re in the con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
on the door@@ way Manuel Neu@@ er was there .
&quot; so , as he had a shot of ide@@ ye on the la@@ ths ( 56@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of he , Guardi@@ ola caused a four @-@ floor with David Al@@ aba in the center beside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;

in front of the game it was at the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly made Bavaria fans in their audience @-@ blo@@ ody , the followers of hosts went out of Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures , took up the security forces and went up with pot@@ ash against the Mün@@ ch@@ ner follow@@ er . &quot;

&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smo@@ ked , therefore not only the l@@ ungs , but also the teeth - this places a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in case of ren@@ unci@@ ation it reduces the risk of fast .
smokers have a significantly increased risk to lose their teeth early .
this goes out of the long @-@ term study of an international research teams , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with non @-@ smoking areas under smoking , the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mature@@ ly to lose weight - up to 3,@@ 6 @-@ fold higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; major ach@@ wear for dental ar@@ rho@@ ea , car@@ ies and infl@@ amm@@ ation of the g@@ ums , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , empha@@ size the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of loss therefore go back to common g@@ ums with smoking .
&quot; not to be clari@@ fied , do smoking also increase the risk of dental car@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; individuals who heard with smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it can last more than ten years until the compan@@ tion re@@ jects its level of non @-@ smoking , former former author Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; you have to per@@ su@@ ade people from it , non @-@ smokers to be non @-@ smoking , the conductor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking is shorten@@ ed the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for l@@ ungs and vessels and lead to our findings also to a good dental health through to the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 per cent of the population affected by the age of 65 to 74 years of br@@ ess@@ ness divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous investigations have already pointed out that smoking raised the risk to early dental loss .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to establish a system that distr@@ ust citizens , &quot; &quot; said the Commissioner @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ strö@@ m to Malm@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Sweden has to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position into the free trade relations with the US . &quot;
the German government announced support .
&quot; by TTIP , the largest trade @-@ trade area of the world is to be created with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings referring to the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new type of investment . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to come to equal parts of the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
it is intended for the first time also a second instance .
&quot; it would allow it to rise up against the judg@@ ments of obj@@ ection . &quot;
&quot; so far , the procedures involved have been acquired with each other at arbit@@ r@@ ator , a contradiction to their judg@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; during the past months past months it became clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice does not trust , commented Malm@@ strö@@ m . &quot;
in the long term she wants to work according to an International Investment Office .
&quot; in this way , disputes between Chinese companies and the EU could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state of the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) are regarded as one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration @-@ dishes are cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed of opponents as a kind of parallel @-@ tuning , on the organization of damage to tax@@ pay@@ ers , national laws and en@@ force a lowering of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in initial positions , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act are the proposals of the European Commission as in@@ adequate . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it has been especially cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed that they should not apply for the free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ ET@@ A ) . &quot;
the German economic Minister Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) describes the plans on the other hand as a great step forward .
&quot; the Commission considered to be essential points at the reform of essential points , the Federal Ministry of Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ strö@@ m .
the European corporate association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE war@@ ned against that the clari@@ fications of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; particularly small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , it was meant to be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
when the talks about the free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday .
the negotiations run since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of Invest@@ or@@ en@@ schutz has not been discussed with the US until now . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as no longer durable .
Del@@ ic@@ ater Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on the stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( now : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; beside him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ effective res@@ or@@ ting of the picturesque US @-@ State of Michigan have recorded with fil@@ tr@@ ap@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 persons , is nearly taken of St@@ ev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he tells about different places , which he is always drawn on the map , wher@@ ein his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate songs report . &quot;
where they came up and how it looks there in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has been proven to be wonderful Cre@@ ole errors .

&quot; to be directed to the public without a word about the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the wide enriched album . &quot;

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ü@@ t with the question of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Deb@@ ü@@ t is awaiting the questionn@@ aires of the Prime Minister with voltage
the new Labour chair Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n shall give his debut on the prime minister of the Prime Minister and set it for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise shortly after lunch the first of its six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon , taking advantage of the media probably and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot;
he called &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p some meetings to leave her colleagues .
&quot; this meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s leadership , as it is after his appointment as a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ et and his speech on the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Decision of Labour Party , on Tuesday during the Sing@@ ing of the National h@@ ym@@ ne held in silence at the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , cri@@ tically prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs , and stands at the centre of several titles on Stories in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s decision whether to sing the national h@@ ym@@ n has drawn attention to itself
&quot; a spokes@@ man said by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said , he had &quot; &quot; respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he has recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the air of England &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour Party to sing , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the mon@@ archy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have consecr@@ ated to serve in Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s of peak , and they refer to differences in the economy , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a six @-@ sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked up within Labour , namely by Mr Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s pronoun@@ cements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour will make it possible to remove the whole idea of a limit total .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of labour and pensions ministers said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is said only against the government plans , to reduce the limit of 26@@ .000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair that David Cameron has since then moved to the D@@ isp@@ atch Box during the last decade .
&quot; the Labour chair that promised to be another policy set , says he &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP did have said that the question of the Prime Minister &apos;s Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ational , and that he will be under@@ lined both &quot; &quot; perc@@ eptions &quot; &quot; and the dispute with resist@@ ors and is instead made to focus on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , which is represented by Angela Eagle , who will not participate in his shadow , if he is not participating abroad - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also has brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ co@@ w , the spokes@@ man of the home , addressed to the problem . &quot;
&quot; he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he said that he is linked to the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; &quot; he often linked with the questionn@@ aire of the Prime Minister . but some years later he thinks that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent to television first in 1990 , the questionn@@ aire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the place of a leader and his stand under his parliament , despite critics , it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and deliber@@ ate far@@ ther reform . &quot;

between May and July the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.8 % compared to the same previous year .
this percentage has been the fastest and estimates of the time of a interest rate .
the pound rose by more than 1 % compared to $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was clim@@ bed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the F@@ TSE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 30 % on 6.@@ 229@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
the SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over @-@ offering of the Riv@@ alen AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands like Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
bur@@ berry shares were after encouraging news from the competition Group for luxury estates in Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; in Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest outlets , all expectations and showed that the sales in China - a key market for bur@@ berry - returns to growth . &quot;
&quot; shares of Glen@@ core came around 5 % after the mountain build@@ ese said that he has taken 2.5 billion US $ by a share of stock , as part of its strategy of debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper reel MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , namely with a decrease to 4,@@ 3 % after gold should sell their estimate for the rating &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;

the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages is threat@@ ening the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more purchase force in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is un@@ likely that this buying comes with the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that might mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; since then , in its store it is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;

met@@ ry starts ground@@ breaking campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - waste
met@@ to is trying to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branches in front of a Al@@ di @-@ mar@@ sch in South Australia and Western Australia .
food Wholes@@ alers Met@@ ry has launched a ground @-@ continuous campaign to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , met@@ ry and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets can strengthen relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through ma@@ instream @-@ marketing and marketing through the social media , just about events like Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ L@@ ens samples and shop@@ owners , who sell tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ ry to further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , if the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment is performing his annual investors problem . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot at stake , since South Australia and Western Australia nearly 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ shops , and higher profits as a Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; An@@ k@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts in South Australia and Western Australia are essential , provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers , have much greater market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in the east @-@ states . &quot;
&quot; however , an@@ alysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening its first markets turn away about five percent of the food market in these two states and will see all the existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; a report published this week , estimated the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ ry 250 million will lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the progn@@ osis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens in SA and 30 in WA in the next year , and a turnover of 500 million US $ and 600 million will be achieved in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery store and in the amounts on Met@@ cas@@ hs , high fixed costs could cost savings of around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time met@@ ry market shares in the east@@ states , mainly at Al@@ di and CO@@ LES , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ An@@ k@@ An@@ ders are the most common . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley particip@@ ates that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.3 percent in 2017 and 2.8 percent in 2016 will be reduced to 10,@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week he told the leading Fon@@ d@@ sman@@ ager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eating in Melbourne that met@@ ry probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ to put it to public on the comments made by Mr Dou@@ glass .
yet it is understood that a prec@@ ursor of Met@@ als with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact .
&quot; IG@@ As Market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and savings from Met@@ cas@@ hs Nutri@@ tional and Food trading , which has been around 43 percent since 2012 , which reflect the operating debt recovery at simultaneous pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler camp , however , and is investing more than 150 million dollars to reduce prices with CO@@ LES and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week at the same and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by fast growing fresh food and to deliver a better choice of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ cas@@ hs &apos;s main business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price custom@@ izations and loading @-@ refurb@@ ishment of vig@@ or are to be set up and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to a profit @-@ growth momentum for the first time in 2017 . &quot;
Than@@ i Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Heal@@ y
Than@@ i Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise as a cri@@ tique of its behavior .
Th@@ ā@@ si Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damage &quot; in the shorter storm all around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve Heal@@ y rather praise as criticism for their own behavior .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger the talented Du@@ os , which is called once again as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; &quot; by the in@@ famous confrontation of K@@ yr@@ in@@ os with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka with the Montreal Masters in the spotlight . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y Quali@@ fication game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent called Ryan Har@@ rison twice through the arbit@@ rat@@ ors and called Har@@ rison . &quot; Li@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat k@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was recently viewed as he was sm@@ ashed a tennis r@@ ack@@ et after a cr@@ amp@@ ant was destroyed by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended from Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth in order to win the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I get pretty addi@@ ctive , is the fact that after my view is Th@@ asi a little in the dispute was crossed , &quot; stated Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a r@@ ack@@ et , when he lost a r@@ ack@@ et in the US Open , but he is not the first player , which has broken out of fru@@ stration with itself , and I know Th@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but really , he really beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around them , he has a great family around us , and I believe he was a little too nar@@ row@@ ly treated . &quot;
&quot; he is a very te@@ ar 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he does not work in the team and so on , he has never practi@@ sed a problem with other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe it deserves to judge according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; Heal@@ y also supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on the important award , which starts on Friday and he describes the &apos; common decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he ensures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term solid component into the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the contro@@ versi@@ es around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said Heal@@ y . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick has done very quickly to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ends in the eyes of the public , and he has got some obli@@ vi@@ me bug , but we try to think him the consequences of his actions . some time outside of the spotlight , I think it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refuge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , holds refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the not@@ ary and ri@@ dden the south @-@ border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all firm , who tried to come illeg@@ ally across the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulated in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and ser@@ bian officials with rebel@@ lion . &quot;
&quot; the people who were cap@@ tiv@@ ated against violence , were stuck for a rough time in a stre@@ amer on the road between the two contro@@ versi@@ es of the countries and built up tents , and sat down there . &quot;
but Fru@@ ct@@ ment came to .
&quot; as a police force on them sh@@ opp@@ ed , sk@@ ate the migrants &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ rie@@ ve ins@@ ults against the Hungarian feeding police . &quot;
some ref@@ used from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returned from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ pillar .
&quot; in the coming days there will be conversations with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence in the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border arrived one day after the 28 @-@ Nations block at a str@@ ati@@ ful meeting in Brussels .
&quot; the Ministers agreed , however , to share responsibility for 40@@ ,000 people who would c@@ ursed Italy and Greece . they oppressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include some more 120@@ .000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary did not put his hopes for a bal@@ ancing action from Brussels or from its neighbors .
&quot; the not@@ ched on Tuesday was in two southern regions , there were greater powers to cope with the crisis , so they could un@@ lock streets and asylum techniques . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is also planning the construction of a bar@@ bed wir@@ l along its border to Romania , in order to stop the migrants of migrants through the country after it ended up a fence on the Ser@@ b border . &quot;
&quot; CB@@ S News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prisoners have been employed in the race , the bar@@ bed @-@ wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; over the past few months , Hungary has turned out for many war@@ ners from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , and has become a substantial investment in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban , however , passed on that most of the coming economic migrants are to be looking for a better life , and not war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that stands strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws created around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) High Za@@ us to construct the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws put even higher liability for condem@@ ned human rights . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian Government explains the condition , &quot; President Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs Re@@ por@@ ters in the Southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the efforts of the military , which is expected to be expected for next week , but re@@ porter of Associ@@ ated Press have already been employed at the border hard to armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ org@@ y Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities know 45 people at an attempt to cross the border , 15 others were even deeper into the land . &quot;
&quot; they come her@@ ded by sh@@ ame@@ ful by the fence , they are now acc@@ used in polishing and shall be acc@@ used for the acc@@ used of criminal off@@ ences after the new laws . &quot;
authorities are going to fix the fence fast .
&quot; Hungarian officials open on Tuesday morning two of the seven border out@@ going with Serbia , after a draw@@ wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed rods to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos changed the most important thres@@ hold sur@@ pass near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in an metal container to process the data of people and supp@@ ress a crowd . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come back , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
&quot; another group of migrants are blo@@ cking the most important highway connection between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would like to spend food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons Vor@@ sprung ist prior to Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of Hill@@ ary Clinton remains a two @-@ digit stage in the democratic race for nom@@ ination on a national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her opposite the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton is now the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the elections ( 58 percent before ) , while being second is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ der , vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ der , who has not yet proclaimed if he held for the presidential office , receive support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it &apos;s too early to say that their opinion are determined to what candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons supporters are in their choice compared to the other candidates .
&quot; since the CB@@ S @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost in a series of dem@@ ographic groups , while others had achieved some prizes . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great head in women and vegetables , but these lead @-@ ins have decreased . &quot;
&quot; your support in the males is significantly dropped , and S@@ anders will just be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage with democratic weighing under 50 years has dou@@ bled , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton had a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit stage with the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point jump in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the elections that they would say with enthusiasm to support Clinton if it was nominated by the Party .
&quot; a quarter would support them with some precau@@ tions and further 15 percent would only support it , because it is the candidate . &quot;
six percent would not support it .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ tons current supports most of all of you are thrilled .
the views are more mixed with those who currently do not support Clinton - only about a quarter would it enth@@ use it .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections they say they Clinton with enthusiasm , say less re@@ publi@@ can voters regarding their sh@@ utt@@ enk@@ an@@ di@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons supporters in an open question are asked , so it is the most common response that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman president is being President ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
by Clin@@ tons supporters will also be mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement for dealing with problems and the voters will also be c@@ ited .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office in the washing machine , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections see him - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters of the elections are asked , who would be their second choice for the party is bi@@ ds at the head . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ tons followers , more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before proceeding . &quot;
&quot; decides not decide for nom@@ ination of the democr@@ ats to Fran@@ cis@@ ed , Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons Vor@@ sprung up against S@@ anders , increased from 20 points with bi@@ den on the race at 30 points without holding it in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a nomin@@ ee with the best chances to win the choice ; however , this number of 78 percent declined in the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage of that looks him as the &quot; Cal@@ d@@ est &quot; , has risen . &quot;
&quot; however , on the question of what is more important when a candidate is more important , democrati@@ s@@ ation call for questions about the elect@@ or@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; just like the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates contribute excellent results in some important marks for voters of the elections of their party .
&quot; we are looking at Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ds as honest@@ ly and trust@@ worthy and with strong leaders . &quot;
bi@@ ds cuts in three candidates at best in honest@@ y while Clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the leadership .
&quot; thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ob@@ ide@@ ological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , some quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; there are questions about Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons usage of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the majority of the Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not influence its opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans now is dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was light , was split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail does not have any effects on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 per cent said that their opinion of her still deteri@@ or@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of ten who say their views from Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as sincere and trust@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the elect@@ or@@ ate do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
at the same time 55 percent of the elect@@ oral comm@@ its are also mir@@ ro@@ mp than not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , get good notes on leadership . &quot;
&quot; by the six tested candidates , cut Bi@@ son , Car@@ son and Bush on best for honest@@ y . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards rather than frank@@ ly , but like with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the failure rate for the sample @-@ sample of 351 @-@ voters in the elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son returned to land@@ lady near Donald Tru@@ mp
Ben Car@@ son is based on CB@@ S News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tru@@ mp
&quot; in the meantime , half of the aid of voters in the new pol@@ l had declined dramatically , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters support land@@ es@@ far further tru@@ mp in great numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last CB@@ S survey conducted prior to Fox news debate last month to 27 % in survey from Tuesday .
but car@@ son lay in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey revealed that Car@@ son arrives at dem@@ ographic groups well and sur@@ g@@ mp under re@@ publi@@ can voters with university education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Govern@@ or John Ka@@ himself , who has fallen deep@@ en with Wis@@ cons@@ ulate Govern@@ or Scott Walker , who has deep@@ est 10 % of the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
the former Florida @-@ Govern@@ or Je@@ b Bush , the former govern@@ or of Ark@@ ansas Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are situated at 6 % in third place . &quot;
the dys@@ functions at the sampling of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support at the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed also Tru@@ mp considerably from Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ eves for former neuro@@ surge@@ ons , even after Car@@ son re@@ ap@@ ologi@@ ze , Tru@@ mp@@ s faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp on last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the east@@ erly Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even though peak values are measured only at distance , enough for swim@@ suit already for a trip to the Mediterranean to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in Nord@@ land or Baltic Sea might be a very short pleasure in a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; Mak@@ ing is no longer entering the sea : maximum 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the German Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , bath temperatures still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Br@@ other@@ hood with the death of a bar@@ ker College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ing deb@@ ited
&quot; almost two years after a student during a c@@ ic@@ an@@ ous ritu@@ als of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , ver@@ died , M@@ ord@@ an@@ kl@@ es are filed against five people . &quot;
members of New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI Hon@@ ors &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introductory visit to the hospital in September 2013 and consumed his transportation to the hospital in which he has contributed to his death divided the police .
&quot; officials spoke , he had been loaded with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack filled with sand , and repe@@ ats repeatedly , while he tried to go over a frozen field on a goal . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally worked through he@@ ada@@ ches , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta Mixing Br@@ other@@ hood does not called the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent and wa@@ ited sup@@ pose@@ dly an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to switch D@@ eng@@ s clothes to contact his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Br@@ other@@ hood to get advice , report@@ e@@ ef Chris Wagner on a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members were hi@@ ding to hide and put the welfare of the Br@@ other@@ hood of fundamentally about that by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Pol@@ ari@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning to his wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; after an Autop@@ o@@ gue , Den@@ g repeatedly has been per@@ ished with st@@ um@@ ed strength injuries of head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the chic@@ ans of the Br@@ other@@ hood . at least a student dies since 1970 , Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family represents , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held accountable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe received an indi@@ ct@@ ment for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Br@@ other@@ hood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged by fat@@ al attack and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organisation that - officially or in@@ official - that &apos;s why we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College is forbidden to withdraw from the Br@@ other@@ hood , and the national Br@@ other@@ hood joined its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; literally comes , and the house@@ se will come into w@@ ank@@ ar , ra@@ int@@ ites for bonds and the economy will lead into a recession . &quot;
this is what we know .
what we don &apos;t know is how long that take everything and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers little instructions on the process . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first rate of interest rates and lasted 2 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at the lifting of interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in doing such as the economy and financial installations . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed that investors do not focus on how it begins to increase interest rates , but rather for the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; at the end , market participants could find that the whole excitement because of a adver@@ t could possibly be exag@@ ger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis becomes in@@ vari@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; &quot; cheap &quot; &quot; said , Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ f@@ om with Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to be too afraid . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , taking advantage of adver@@ t things can make things for a while vol@@ ati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase is , the influence is not as dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that tax@@ onom@@ ies have decreased from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank Analy@@ ses in a newer study . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in advance - about 14 percent - on the way to cement capital , rather low in the last six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 per cent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief system strategy for Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
&quot; the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur later in the enh@@ age cycle , and the end@@ ends begins to decrease . &quot;
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but also adver@@ tise it often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some circumstances which were not previously released and could ha@@ sten the recession . &quot;
extremely worthy in this context is that the gross domestic product is placed near its lowest point in the survey of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank in the 118 cen@@ aries , since 1950 only the nominal b@@ IP address grew by 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.8 percent , only a few percent expect this to last and expect the third quarter after receipt of Atlanta F@@ ed only 1,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; adver@@ tise here with such frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop might be ris@@ ky and throw the question whether it &apos;s different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year on a hybrid structure of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee during this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many str@@ at@@ ees and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could cause an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures deal is just a lik@@ eli@@ hood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all the increases cycles of 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing momentum during the GDP had taken place and on @-@ rec@@ essions very quickly after the start of recovery in the shade , &quot; so the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest which fet@@ ched the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the firm income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market has presented a form of adver@@ t , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect at bonds faster is when compared with shares in their strategic direction .
&quot; at bonds , the rit@@ es appear to switch the direction as soon as the first increase / lowering in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increases cycle , the ab@@ dom@@ inion fall off immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the Str@@ at@@ egen of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in interest rates will result in the rise , that rar@@ ity between longer and shorter bonds can bring closer together and lead to a fl@@ ashes of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ rate bonds often bring improved yiel@@ ds in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yiel@@ ds &quot; , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ st upon Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decrease in inflation , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest have risen , the income gap is fl@@ atter , credit @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing have risen and the vol@@ ati@@ lity has risen - all characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has exac@@ erb@@ ated their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and throughout the company , companies that settle bigger part of their operations in the U.S. , benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multination@@ als with high debts are worse there since an increasing dollar spent their products on the global market and just as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; &quot; is tend to react fully positive , three months after an initial publication exce@@ ed@@ ingly positive , &quot; said Gold@@ man &apos;s analy@@ st in one report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet in Europe have exce@@ eded the balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital re@@ ada@@ bility as well as low volumes even exceed their shares also met their counter@@ parts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a big problem .
&quot; businesses with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely , said gold . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers are also able to benefit from the rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; as@@ par@@ agus could see profits by higher yiel@@ ds even though experts in different opinion , how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Par@@ ent@@ re@@ member Andrew B@@ ingham . &quot;
the conserv@@ atives member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the radio because of its &quot; destruction &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is becoming increasingly distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted on the BBC Music Awards and said that she was only The Br@@ its im@@ i@@ ded
parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins laid the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament member and ex@@ iting new pressure on the radio , to prove that he does not do anything that does not do the personal sender . &quot;
&quot; the conserv@@ ative de@@ pu@@ ties Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal Radi@@ os@@ esi@@ ze &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and increasingly could no longer be distinguished from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards which started on the last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , The Br@@ its seem to be only under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something else - these are two spontaneous called examples , where you actually only im@@ itate what is already in the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General , he pointed , and ar@@ gu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and the general public . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , this I &apos;ll learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new works to order , I am also really important for them , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to work hard to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports to it under fire , to get the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory @-@ De@@ co &apos;s Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins added The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producers min@@ pa media for estimated costs of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall consi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; produced in a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added , he also wish that the company &quot; hit a hit from our house @-@ house @-@ house , &quot; if there is the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ used to ex@@ clude the order from other rows of The Voice in the Future or to spend money of the en@@ act@@ ment for other signat@@ ories . &quot;
Internet turnover in August on the slow@@ est and black Friday may be responsible for this .
seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
last month we had the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by the use of mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday has stopped in November 2010
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping centre has been bre@@ ached , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into ha@@ ster@@ ling cities . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there is now signs of stagn@@ ating the online revenues , after new numbers only had seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs of stagn@@ ation that an agreement had only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go to 2000 , then she has always been developing in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , Editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales in the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the online sales of three years ago increased , as buyer began to make use of their mobile purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , this is one , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which imported from America is as a reason for subsequent turnover . &quot;
experts believe buyers have their obj@@ ection before this event which takes place on the last Friday in November .
&quot; last year five times the average number of buyers to make their computer , to make their bar@@ gain , and some traders dropped . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer car@@ ved because of bar@@ gain , buyers of which could ab@@ stain from purchases . &quot;
a study of the British Retail Con@@ sortium was awarded a little bit more than 1 £ online .
&quot; with some products such as TV and wash@@ es , more than one third of the purchases can now be done via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people clothing and shoes online instead of in the bo@@ oth@@ s in the capit@@ als . &quot;

B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European arti@@ sans is over
&quot; British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has rise behind them
&quot; this leads to that 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix scripts , which are aimed at craftsmen , &quot;
at the same time King@@ fisher 60 B &amp; Q sales addresses land@@ ed far
&quot; von Ru@@ per@@ t St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that British conduct their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified European arti@@ sans who perform the works in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sent with a hammer or a brush to to@@ wing W@@ walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; for British employ increasingly arti@@ sans , to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the leader of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , a new business leader of King@@ fisher , who owns the hom@@ ec@@ ate chain , said that a great increase in the number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe , providing services for low @-@ growth is now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , king@@ fisher , 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops open , which can be directed at craftsmen and 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said that they want to employ more women in B &amp; Q Shops because eight out of 10 buying decisions in the shop will be made by women .
at the moment we weigh the men .
&quot; she said , it was necessary to face the growing dem@@ ographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our stores .
we need to move this stronger to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients made up of women with 80 percent of the decisions made by the purchase of items by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry that is one of only five women at the head of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed as well , her top team has been synthe@@ ti@@ led to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ fisher is almost the only company that occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women including its management and financial performance .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity here is an important issue here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our super@@ visory board .
King@@ fisher wast@@ ed a decrease in the half @-@ year profit and the attempts to blame the group the cost of the closing of the shops .
&quot; because of the trends King@@ fisher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q has to open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ I / dam because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , Kl@@ agen@@ furt took place on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ vice @-@ president A@@ I / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
the def@@ endants ref@@ used not guilty .
one of them had been charged because of Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ure .
from this pro@@ clam@@ ation he has been acqu@@ itted in May in May .
the current process was inver@@ ted .
&quot; according to the country @-@ state Robert Ri@@ ffel had appeared out in the pre @-@ investigations that acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from agreement concerts , via which they may be disp@@ ers@@ ed in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
the damage he has covered with around 400@@ .000 Euro .
the sport @-@ function@@ aries are also charged because of financial per@@ sec@@ ti@@ fication .
&quot; this fact was the Chairman of the opening of the opening , the judge of Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the pro@@ clam@@ ation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defense , that the association has created an asset to no point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports functions would only afford elev@@ ations and the sports club , who had been working for it from 1982 to 2011 , and have invested a lot of time and money , from the debts - the Passi@@ va decreased in 2001 around 600@@ .000 I@@ illing ( around 44@@ .000 ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we keep the club or lock us ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the acc@@ used , in a large @-@ session bed in the financial officer . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take this task . &quot;
with all risks .
&quot; we have so pre@@ dest@@ ined for money , our li@@ vel@@ ations as safety in the bank did , &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; with the association have been agreed , you can manage the money freely , no debt should be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it was decided in case of proportion@@ ate financial - success the payment of the allowance for damages to 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one portion of the allowance for instance has become years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was paid in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also packages - and not detail@@ ing details , explained by the former Ob@@ mann the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and deposits have designated the two acc@@ used together , the second acc@@ used said . &quot;
&quot; why the pay@@ outs of the association had not been detailed , he asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial system , which is important for the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functioning of intern@@ ships due to Am@@ t@@ sm@@ iss@@ ure began , an amount of 120@@ .000 Euro was transferred to the office account . &quot;
&quot; they have been in@@ let , the def@@ endants ref@@ used . &quot;
&quot; this securities , had the name of the second acc@@ used , and according to its statement by the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; I wanted to know the ke@@ eper . &quot;
I did not leave the answer for a long time .
&quot; after all , he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have wa@@ ited some of this money , the prosec@@ ut@@ or put into the room . &quot;
the co @-@ def@@ endant have been informed that justi@@ fies the functioning of the functions .
this assignment was formulated as &quot; thread @-@ judg@@ ement . &quot;
why harm to claims ? , they wanted to judge and prosec@@ ut@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the first acc@@ used , he did not agree with this wor@@ ding , because the association has never created a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the working class , he never did a p@@ enny sal@@ ary , he only charged o@@ eter@@ tip and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets , he made the association 1,000 euros per month in the bill , the actual effort was much higher , but he added . &quot;
precise documents for the early years could not advance the acc@@ used .
&quot; these are after a auditing , in which everything was judged as correctly , no longer kept , av@@ owed them . &quot;
Kilom@@ et@@ geld had also covered the second acc@@ used .
&quot; all remedies can be done in cash , for this , he has to pass from his own position in geno@@ cide to the bank to B@@ lei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings will continue on September 23 with the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation of witnesses .

time of decision on interest rates of US not@@ aries
&quot; the world observed if the U.S. not@@ ebook has been observed in two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to meet the important decision whether for the first time since almost one decade of interest are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey under 80 econom@@ ists who were asked by Re@@ u@@ ters found that the F@@ ed is doing so , now think that the F@@ ed will do some longer , and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 2.5 percent will keep . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest is increased to NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank might be the zero @-@ area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Martin U@@ bi@@ de , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance , Bil@@ li@@ onen &apos;s assets are added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less per@@ missible outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it has war@@ ned the markets to turn on an increase , but the indication indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;

&quot; the police asked the calls for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he has no explanation for its shots .

&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; returned to the writing of the notification , 300 miles to Delta State University , where he spent E@@ than Schmidt , an Professor of History , spot@@ ted before he eventually took his own life on Monday night , when polic@@ emen took him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ For@@ ge said , he know nothing of a conflict between husband and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the ob@@ sup@@ pose@@ dly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ce also had a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who told they were about seven years married as a &quot; good human being . &quot; &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can not play annually because of double str@@ ac@@ upuncture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Eindhoven a double str@@ ac@@ upuncture of his right leg .
&quot; while this took the left outside ministry to we@@ eping and join him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w could play back in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack on Hé@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 years old Sha@@ w was in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was brought to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg , and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will leave tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operate in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has been very difficult and then doesn &apos;t happen . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen @-@ mask on .
he cri@@ es .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double str@@ ac@@ upuncture , then it will last six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , a red card and the suspension of a El@@ f@@ et . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Riz@@ z@@ oli , the arbit@@ r@@ ator , has not pun@@ ished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ r@@ ator had mist@@ aken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself when I say that a El@@ f@@ meter , and a red card was due . &quot;
it was a very worse attack with both legs .
&quot; a Twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account kept : &quot; &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how much I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
herein referred to : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w with the defeat of the PS@@ V
England def@@ enders has an additional incentive to recover up to the coming June in France .
&quot; Philli@@ p C@@ oc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very dirty injury . &quot;
if a player leaves this kind of injury the place are all very sad .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg tion in Mexico against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very con@@ lim@@ b injury is that is not good , &quot; said C@@ oc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , who in another direction was , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; down him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with SB@@ S@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels like I know how hard to be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ Player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dia was also brought into hospital - following a F@@ oul@@ lu@@ de by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not take long before you know it almost completely . &quot;
&quot; it is , because you are perhaps David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the 1971 were created by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to give my children , because there &apos;s always a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , described in the Cameron presented the plot of the book , instead again introducing a content of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details added to the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the Moor@@ ish city Th@@ ought @-@ Ville where all nature has gone , and even the air is a commodity to win a boy named Au@@ dre@@ y the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to meet her desire to make a real tree , whose real name Theod@@ or Se@@ uss ho@@ el lau@@ gh and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that is not yet dec@@ ayed enough , the text presented by Cameron presented as partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where all artificial , and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is giving out a prag@@ matic father , it seems un@@ likely that Cameron is said so little familiar . here is an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the gl@@ aci@@ fied Lor@@ ax , a band@@ man , sn@@ ur@@ ve essence , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a volunteer , which did not read a child 20 times in a child . &quot;
&quot; a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ speaker said , that the text probably came from Camer@@ ons choice . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was supplied by Camer@@ ons employees , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emir@@ ates , is a difficult task , but if one has chosen the Ka@@ der , the England for the tour , is a re@@ petition of the 3 @-@ 0 test @-@ series defeat not on my map . &quot;
I would not ex@@ clude a warming .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the battles level , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a y@@ outh@@ ful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali is designed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown dimensions on test level , is an option for attack . &quot;
here related news : Adam Ly@@ th schei@@ d from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex Hal@@ es .
&quot; to allow Adam Ly@@ th to allow for me to be as a Che@@ f@@ ab in Yor@@ k@@ shire , very difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are targeted toward results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ ination , since - and I told this - players their own best ones . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one could have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny . &quot;
if he hopefully rise further rounds of Yor@@ k@@ shire it comes another chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss pra@@ ised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get as good performances , and that surprised me ; he is especially a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test @-@ stroke gets to get its mark is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son got before him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine got .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance for do @-@ and @-@ war@@ dly play .
&quot; the only proposal one can rise , was that England was first put Jonathan my ott in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex Hal@@ es comes in , and he is a h@@ man , which I rank high . &quot;
he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player that we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season as he sco@@ op@@ ted to us on a Tr@@ ent bridge square which met us very much .
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team creation in the United Arab Emir@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ een turn next to C@@ ook , which would get an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four qu@@ icks , I emerged , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I do not see why a h@@ man can not beat there , and that left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ er@@ l by cri@@ cket @-@ players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een may not settled his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my early team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined in 2001 as a Open@@ er .
he has made three hundred ro@@ us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari is in the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner and in my limited handling of him he has impressed me as a young man .
&quot; people might see their statistics - average of 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a sh@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup @-@ sp@@ inners before their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team England has made a few wis@@ u@@ ge supplements while exercising .
&quot; the appointment of Ma@@ hel@@ a Jay@@ awar@@ es , the Bat@@ sman from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for test games could be a master@@ cou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , as it played amongst all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and like Ma@@ hel@@ a he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the envelop@@ e can bring a fresh wind , even if the news stand in line with the previous mess@@ ag@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys team coll@@ ar at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem for my part . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team @-@ creators are not defined the schedule . &quot;
and they must remember that as players depend on their jobs from the results .
such decisions are not made easy to the heart .

&quot; a European diplomacy and said that some member states , so deeply ent@@ angl@@ ed in various crises , just as the EU is now and not always out of own fault , Britain himself created agenda with ten@@ se conc@@ essions and dis@@ rup@@ tive policies that they are mostly not want . &quot;
&quot; in Bright@@ on , TU@@ C decided on their annual meeting that it does not like to end@@ anger social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers on the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , make a photo of themselves from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they will gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to be an out looking at the inside of the EU Zel@@ tes - &quot; let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and continues to see that more and more short @-@ sight@@ ed ministers and officials come up to the point where we don &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany careful chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a heart@@ ed but she has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for them , as it was during exag@@ ger@@ ated long term as Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a le@@ ague of power .
&quot; Poland will soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a le@@ f@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that they will be a bit@@ ing to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to have , because most similar differences will have tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , maybe some such ministers may even seem un@@ inten@@ tionally un@@ helpful remarks , entirely in SN@@ P @-@ style , while Britain &apos;s referendum @-@ sil@@ vers@@ i 2017 , in order to accelerate the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how rough the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and which EU sc@@ ep@@ tic is the oligar@@ chy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , as it did not support it during the Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum in 1975 and did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember this weak in Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro Opport@@ unity who has made a name as an &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s years . &quot;

&quot; actually thought Tony Bl@@ air similarly to her , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a c@@ age , you &apos;re better ban@@ anas to distr@@ act him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air itself , when he sat down the Camer@@ ons refer@@ en@@ du@@ ms@@ wir@@ ls , because Bl@@ air was rejected the principle of the not passed by the EU , which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that open him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never wast@@ ed him .
&quot; but the cute Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly boy on the back - I told him that he no longer time for me to waste my room - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ ray strategy of the 80 @-@ s years , an error at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s &apos;s official position for Europe - I press it friendly out - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional blood @-@ bear tendency and the wild ge@@ fil@@ ming of tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say any to you yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n &quot; &quot; is said , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on Radio and on television this week said , not to ad@@ mit that Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s appointment of the pro@@ vo@@ da@@ ddy John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as a sh@@ ad@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it re@@ minded me of the 70 @-@ s years , when his old father had distinguished himself in television to be interested in his labor force , without losing far too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; in all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s term - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C said to his fellow @-@ h@@ ites and MEPs in all reports on their pre@@ judi@@ ce at night &apos;s Eve . &quot;
whatever the tou@@ ching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline will be important in the age of TV all around the clock and above all in the structure of social media at a ne@@ o@@ e of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe who allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ en@@ du@@ ce campaign for a matter of course , like Mc@@ Donn@@ ell it said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks of that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ b@@ yn@@ s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity for EU membership in accordance with its B@@ enn@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ er@@ se economy , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ oter@@ ic discussion under the left dis@@ cip@@ her , which is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ity to N@@ ato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ lowship convinced that J@@ C will not take a campaign for leaving - foreign diplom@@ ats will be committed to trying to find a sense of their super@@ vis@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin are w@@ asting political capital - they also mis@@ pronoun@@ ced voters - to make conf@@ essions to the British when all of this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the U.S. are already fairly disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , what I called the British Inf@@ lu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
expert critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of an state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by giving them the public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used .
he published the &quot; fundamental report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have ques@@ tioned the loading of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
one feature in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month laid the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily wind@@ y basis on which he established his most important conclusion on the p@@ he .
&quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ X and have asked if the declar@@ ations will build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tro@@ pical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ ewell , Professor of Clinical Epi@@ dem@@ i@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they told that the public expects that the argument of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estim@@ ation is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of the mod@@ elling and mod@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ degree Decision @-@ analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage caused by various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ av@@ am told that a sponsor of the meeting had a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose Managing Director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funding from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes producer , but not the funding they have received according to reports before the Tab@@ ak@@ enburg Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ y@@ um are not delivered , but include several known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a range of industrial financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the Tab@@ ak@@ control .
the tobacco be@@ headed by p@@ he also took part in the session .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; pro@@ marked &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages most of the products in most of the criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ av@@ am . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ av@@ am told that the declar@@ ations of p@@ he that there have so far no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; prof Kevin F@@ enton , Director of health and well @-@ being near p@@ he said that I have responded to the claims of BM@@ X previously . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifetime smoking dies in his addi@@ ction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all evidence is near to aid the health risk of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes compared to it , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has given the unique obligation to inform the public about what the evidence has been proven and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative danger to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ .000 people annually die on an illness with respect to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion € per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear proposition of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes cannot be without risk but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ end@@ ders , says former chief of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , told The BBC should stop programs like East@@ end@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm , &quot; for hit @-@ Shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ band should only be used to do the type of programs that cannot be sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed the BBC that they will probably saw publicly @-@ legal programs that probably have seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ str@@ anded newspaper windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and by sen@@ ders like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Manager , Tony Hall , told that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success I tried to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs is in order or sends them to un@@ conventional ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the tour cleaning fee , what I mean in the medium or long term , not for a good idea , you should at least do your production at least on programs that others do not make or put in order . &quot;
&quot; they send The voice in a first @-@ first time window , because they want to reach as broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise nobody would show this is a joke , it is ridicul@@ ous ; it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said : &quot; &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programme financed , which might even be financed without subsi@@ dies . &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ end@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; truly speaking , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I would like to see myself just how this should be publicly @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepren@@ eur for series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC educ@@ d at the hunt was &quot; &quot; due to the am@@ bitions of the people who work there , and because they believe it is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give that again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Book Show in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ end@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , but they do not measure the audience , but they can fulfil their tasks , and they can ar@@ gu@@ ed if they have created on their apparent missions to justi@@ fication of 4 billion £ Rund@@ funk@@ tions , &quot; Well , of course , we have seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broad@@ casting fee said Johnson the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all that you get a great value for 150 £ per year here , but for guys who &apos;s for 150 £ a lot of money , ask me if this is true , because they consume no much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , ur@@ ged that the BBC has to review her Rei@@ th@@ ian mission , to make up and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it will be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and it should be reflected in the public @-@ related TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of whom he said that only a hand@@ ful on TV are shown , and with the commercial transm@@ itters they address to make everything online . &quot;

further to this topic : researchers read and write hyper@@ activity with light
&quot; the researchers told , the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ genetic , in which ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und can be used to activate a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside of the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of a day into the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
they usually do not react to ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und but Chal@@ as@@ ani they did it if they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles .
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und @-@ waves , which penet@@ rate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ul@@ tran@@ oise @-@ waves work on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ izer channels and in the membran@@ es of some of the thro@@ ws .
&quot; the b@@ umps make the opening of these icons and activate the cells in which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ ire , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani gene@@ tically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ion TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ icons . &quot;
&quot; when it addresses ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und on the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro @-@ blood vessels and into the wor@@ ms where they turn on the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ gene@@ tics , a ground@@ breaking tool , which allows the scientists to use neur@@ ons with imp@@ etus to the light . &quot;
&quot; however , Bh@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ gene@@ tics might have some advantages over this technique . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to light , that must be sent to an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , low frequency @-@ ul@@ tran@@ oise tissue can happen and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the sk@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with G@@ enth@@ er@@ ap@@ ia and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporary to the ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und signal in a clinical attitude for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and ins@@ ulin producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student Residen@@ ces
&quot; eleven years ago I drew me as a self @-@ ver@@ ted 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dormitory , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile that I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ term complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be done in eight simple rules .
the ho@@ ist in student Residen@@ ces is sufficient to fright@@ ening up to absolutely fright@@ ening .
&quot; it is tem@@ pting to swe@@ pt : people tell where you come , where and where you have taken advantage of where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honest@@ ly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither dear nor hate , because in the Ernst , guys , there is only a yeast extracts ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it bows the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in opposition to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyelashes were ri@@ pped up and these fire@@ holes would be . &quot;
leave people .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages @-@ recipes , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people are moving and their under@@ garments . &quot;
here you have related : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted we get a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; their room should be a refu@@ ge , but many students form a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ off @-@ culture , which can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this may be a hell for someone who tries to rec@@ u@@ perate .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I will I go that our friendship goes on , but you must go away so that I may get the energy that I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ cl@@ as@@ ant of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted - and send it an SMS .
running pos : do you do it .
a guy in my students have had the idea that a failure door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship with b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the peak of back @-@ Man@@ ie , the l@@ oth@@ s to the doors of people , to introduce themselves with a dish full of brow@@ nies , less od@@ d than the welcome the 1950 @-@ he years &quot; Welcome to the neighbourhood , I &apos;ve learned to you something so , and now please smile as I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; homemade treats is a good way to make friends . &quot;
your ro@@ omm@@ ates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain yourself and will end up your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad ming@@ le from fl@@ our , sugar and fats lead to that people make them as@@ le@@ ep when you sang . &quot;
food for ste@@ al is a common crime in student @-@ homes .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but is it the taking of a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they cook in the inner . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is missing your stuff , the anno@@ ying , and you have my sympathy , but try to deal with it in a balanced manner than my ro@@ ommate , who added to their milk a dishwasher , in order to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
it is now in prison .
you should not make noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent human being , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the point among the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , whether there is something to stand up , Drum &amp; Bass a quiet , because it was 3 pm , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted that with even more mature music .
&quot; when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she was so lucky to sleep two hours before they left her own music , closed down its door and settled on their thir@@ sty test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would involve rand@@ om@@ ly in the same student dormitory ?
&quot; and vice versa , it would not be deep embarrass@@ ed when you place a ro@@ ommate for your future couple , who wish to separate themselves and take them every day and perhaps to experience how they all get together in common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a name is ro@@ ommate is definitely not your future spin @-@ in , try at least to talk a little reason . &quot;

&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , for@@ ging , Ger@@ ing@@ ver@@ trained &quot;
the real estate contractor Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the medi@@ um@@ ental Eck@@ ental terr@@ aced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; thus , for refugees - but also as a signal . &quot; &quot; not only refugees need shelter , but also the only char@@ ter@@ ing mother and the righteous . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to show how to get well and well located today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the competition market .
&quot; the entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes in knowing how quickly became affordable living space , it is building in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr. G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the competition market . &quot;
which solution offer you an offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or g@@ ymnas@@ tics has no sustainability .
for people stay in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refuge@@ e number , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ c , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town house needs least space .
it makes integration easier .
that is different when you put people in residential blocks .
each of the six houses that are built especially in the pilot project consists of three units for four asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say there is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily changed according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house is located on 184 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months has taken the construction .
this is appropriate .
do the construction rules have its plans to be complicated ?
g@@ ild@@ ner : buil@@ ders have not removed my project correct .
especially complicated it is always the dro@@ ld@@ ings dro@@ pping slip prof@@ ense and the positioning .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates in a town@@ house three apartments , needs at least three plots . &quot;
only in cities is missing for this place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their town@@ house @-@ project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those , who gave me front , luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
what is definitely not right .
but ti@@ gh@@ ten you not the competi@@ tor in order to affordable housing ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true is it : in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but it was built for luxury apartments which can barely afford a more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , also the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only char@@ ter@@ ing mother or the righteous . &quot;
I am showing how one can still construct and well @-@ constructed today .
that is what it works .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system if Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , in &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some are troub@@ led after the installation to problems , since it received an error message that is un@@ fail@@ ing that the &quot; software update &quot; is failed . &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem is recommended by users , either to wait until the crash goes back or trying to update on iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ etion of apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do so when you install a special tool , making apps and then install them new , once the process is completed . &quot;
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is rechar@@ ged during the updating or is located near a charge device so that the battery is loaded .
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple does not aband@@ on that the update will continue because the phone possibly can switch to hal@@ ogen@@ m paths and lead this to a break@@ age of updates . &quot;

&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - Az@@ endorf I have luck with Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 . &quot;

&quot; after a construction phase , Müller is opening up the practice on October 12th until then he is investing 3@@ 10000 euros into the premises at St.-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the rocks were met by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll , who currently completed their professional @-@ generation in the ver@@ den@@ er hospital and she wants to get into practice as well . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the gar@@ bage dump would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen and laugh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; when it was far , I was simply called . &quot;
with the couple of Müller the idea came to pursue their own practice in As@@ endorf .
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients is very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years , too . &quot;

&quot; we will offer more ultr@@ as@@ o@@ und investigations , as well as long @-@ term and loading of pay@@ ers and need a room @-@ room more . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;

&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice is continuing to continue , &quot; empha@@ sizes Sam@@ t@@ meant Germ@@ ering Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; approximately 2000 patients arrive according to Silvia Müller @-@ G@@ ong@@ oll any quarter into practice field , in the northeast German average practice , it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another multi @-@ arz@@ t@@ ein@@ dustry .
a positive out@@ effect of the practic@@ ing by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen in As@@ endorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have also gone . &quot;
&quot; who have visited gar@@ bage &apos;s lesson , by the way , continues to look primarily to familiar faces : take over seven medical specialist and the cleans@@ ing of the fields . &quot;
&quot; with their departure ends in Az@@ endorf a era , after all , the medical for 30 years have practiced there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , rec@@ alls the Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sen obli@@ que . &quot;
a bit of melan@@ chol@@ y they have already seen after the long time .

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls also passed on to our border line , &quot; said Assi@@ stance in Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remains er@@ ected in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application , this can also be &quot; &quot; of course &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the provision and safety of the people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but also , &quot; that there are distinct signals , &quot; said the mini@@ stries . &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept a bound@@ less migration flow not even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled procedure .
Croatia p@@ onder@@ s &quot; Kor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced , Slovenia wants to travel to refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances cor@@ rid@@ ors will also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; so this was the interior of Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Stav@@ anger . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled at the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; however , like the prime minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians he wants to have its limits to refugees but not convertible . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill out its commitments , otherwise the system can not work , &quot; commented Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government on we@@ dn@@ esday , the first refugees would have tried to arrive in the night hours on Tuesday to go into East Croatian on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to de@@ part the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could gra@@ b them in the nearby regions of corn .
according to local media since Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik continues to meet with new refugees ever since the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
&quot; it is primarily around Sy@@ rac@@ er and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
even rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country with around 4000 refugees , said Assi@@ stance R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also , B@@ usses from Pre@@ cious at the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ bian border , which had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , launched Croatian and Ser@@ bian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade be@@ fallen , however , that it would be to propose people to have certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , at least in the morning , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Ser@@ bian border city of Si@@ d , during the day several buses would expect . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were the whole night away from the Mal@@ t@@ onian border with Serbia on the go .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so we have said the police to go back here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany . &quot;
&quot; hence , it could actually be taken to the observation of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west @-@ located distance . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Minister of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong strain of refugees with appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances . &quot;
&quot; details c@@ ited he did not , but pointed out that Croatia made as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot;
they run strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU @-@ Partner in the country has since taken a good result of what affects the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the ser@@ ole side , behind the Hungarian border fence we continue to grow about 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report they had the past night on the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who is leading to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border sur@@ passes Hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be closed completely .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still un@@ clear .
&quot; the Ser@@ bian interior of N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm the debate at a local eye in Hor@@ g@@ os : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would currently not be a very high level of refugees .
&quot; we could not say whether they would continue to continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers rates migrants - dangerous - Alternative v@@ rou@@ tes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refuge@@ e @-@ par@@ ers have already begun to distribute the refugees cards on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border agreement between Serbia and Croatia is not approximate . however , in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croati@@ a. it is still not affected min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of minorities was sent in the border region .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with Finance @-@ prospects for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ point results for the final quarter , and the Li@@ ef@@ er Gig@@ ant captured his gain on a whole year on account of weak demand for freight service and higher costs in his soil transport . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that they are planning , roughly 55@@ ,000 trade workers for holidays . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company int@@ ends to adjust 50@@ ,000 employees for holiday periods . &quot;
the stock was more than 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market outlets 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to make a profit from 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the fiscal year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than in previous memory . &quot;
an@@ alysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view occurs despite the price increases , average of 4.8 per cent and on 4 January are effective and despite the higher sur@@ charges for soil transpor@@ ting of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it nevertheless expect the result from previous year due to cost reduction , higher earnings and due to growth in online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the &quot; &quot; solid ground@@ ing yiel@@ ds &quot; &quot; when you consider the we@@ aker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday @-@ employment have been announced one day later than those of Riv@@ alen U@@ PS , which is planning , 90@@ .000 to 95@@ .000 additional workers , including the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million has been awarded 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve by Z@@ acks Research Research illustrated an@@ alysts are predi@@ cted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked an@@ alysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has brought a decrease in the international pri@@ ori@@ ous shipping shipping that brought its sales to a stagn@@ ation in recent years .
but the boom in the online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales in soil transport by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher cost for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express @-@ unit are higher profits due to higher prices , while the result are decreased because of higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares by 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they went up to 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; at the most anticipated meeting in the years Federal Reserve Str@@ at@@ egen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ walk Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table sitting in order to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade to lift the conduc@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; th@@ rot@@ ary about them at an end of expi@@ red , two @-@ store@@ yed seat forms , is a picture of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ bel and her colleagues is to put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the central bank has a second order from Congress : maxim@@ ize the US employment and prizes here stable .
&quot; but since the major recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ ri@@ dden mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to def@@ ect by the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows strongly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il should increase in the global financial markets that already over@@ sees F@@ ed Represent@@ atives , these vol@@ ati@@ lity , by raising the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it just around one quarter percentage . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , Che@@ f@@ War in the Mak@@ ler@@ firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think when looking for a pre@@ text , the interest rate was not to increase , the increased uncertainty around the global market enough justi@@ fication , continue to wait &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing what is un@@ ass@@ uring to itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , that were recently inter@@ viewed from Bloom@@ berg , have forec@@ ast@@ ed this week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the financial markets expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key inde@@ er , which shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline of the stock market in case the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the Str@@ at@@ egen multip@@ ly the blow if they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday sp@@ rang the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage by 228@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1,@@ 4 % on 16.@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy considers the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ ski , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ con@@ gen@@ ome , Moody &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the propositions at that time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she is doing it , &quot; if she would rather go far in her explanation to re@@ assure the financial markets , so that they do not get in pan@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; other experts ar@@ gu@@ ing that a cement of financial markets would be calm , because they take the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; another month , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to raise the sentence by 0,25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first little step in a slow tight@@ ening of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , in spite of the complaints from liber@@ als that more economic advance would be necessary , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August demanded , the improvement of the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased on 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level , which sees F@@ ed as a full employment . &quot;
sub@@ missions have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was constantly intensi@@ fied under the yearly goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives were told that the main reason is the temporary effect of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy can overcome higher interest rates and need them because of the strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Che@@ f@@ ö@@ f@@ om by Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ media . &quot;
&quot; but financial markets around the world were together at the end of last month , after China had upgraded its currency . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage grew out of more than 16 % among its top , as investors were fe@@ ared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would re@@ play the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered something in this month , whereby the Dow is now nearly 10 % under the testi@@ cles from May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affect the complex calculation , when to increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news have not occurred on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former associates of the U.S. Not@@ en@@ bank . &quot;
&quot; now , he says ahead that they will wait at least one month to get the impact better on the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy should be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the global economy &apos;s health is none of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be involved in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end it has become the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere saying of the then Leit@@ ner Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be its mon@@ ary expansion &quot; cr@@ amp@@ ed Tur@@ bo@@ ots around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world , in which markets and economies are increasingly familiar with each other , it can be expected by the F@@ ed representatives , but also consult with other central banks and experts to give greater understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; its decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the company En@@ grave Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , manifest@@ ed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of survi@@ vor@@ s on financial market movements , which apparently not linked to economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , proud member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ates for a sponsor ceremony , c@@ ited decisions within the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut their leadership in three meetings &quot; &quot; despite limited recogni@@ z@@ able effects on the growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed Represent@@ atives had un@@ cat@@ chy these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should only place aspects of financial stability just during a severe crisis such as market cooperation in 2008 , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee on the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il come not to the proximity of this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to get into the situation where they are afraid of a adver@@ se , because the markets emerge , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t believe that they should be the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome does not go without the commitment of inn@@ um@@ erable volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are quite a lot of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .

Bra@@ z@@ ens pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to un@@ clear women about how important good nutrition during the lact@@ ation is . she does this with the presentation of paintings from babies , which are of br@@ ates who are painted with portr@@ ay@@ als of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies perform all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mot@@ hers get to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake around 500 cal@@ ories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ abe@@ tic adaptation is to make the mot@@ hers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ ine College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet were pregnant women really concerns the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new am@@ ber sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried Cou@@ ple@@ t the buil@@ ders for the 2.4 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be flat for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym at the Bern@@ rie@@ der sport@@ grounds come step by step : in the recent council meeting the completed building was secured without great discussions .
&quot; previously , the Panel included among other things had a request to a &quot; legislative &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; from the valid non @-@ development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; we used the permission for a special form on the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle with non @-@ heart@@ ed first and bad@@ ger has to be er@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning , the intended use of the umbrella space for solar installations : &quot; thereby we get a wonderful large south @-@ da@@ ch together &quot; , &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; at &quot; &quot; deli@@ ver@@ ance &quot; &quot; it in turn went on around the roof incl@@ ination that is made of energetic reasons - otherwise than in the building plan - under 10 degrees are supposed to be . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; deli@@ ver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because of the development plan regarding the roof tend to be &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the am@@ ber &apos;s budget is usually rather restri@@ ctive in liber@@ ating orders rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; but at the turn@@ key project , however , it is not an recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; so St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV am@@ ried .
some 2.@@ 3 million euros al@@ kal@@ ine costs are calculated .
grants are expected by the school and gr@@ ass@@ ing funding .
&quot; in the next process step , the building entry for the 18 x 36 meters large hall now will be presented to the Land @-@ rat and for the examination . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital of P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed sooner than planned - namely in 2016 .
Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) of the General Director at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of the employees are moved from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
you see the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county of the county of the land@@ lady Andrea Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White .
&quot; however , a decision about the provision of the super@@ visory boards , and the meetings on the coming Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would be in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ ini had to move with fishermen and further existing interior station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who can not be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in W@@ eil@@ heim , &quot; Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees have been informed about the plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ ate clinic since the beginning of the beginning of medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic . &quot;
&quot; in the question , who shall enter the suc@@ cession , according to Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play with the leadership of the &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , to take over the leadership and change with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au pop@@ up this in every case a &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ den@@ ing of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Inner medicine &quot; , &quot; so Jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for heart @-@ gradu@@ al and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the interior of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic diseases .
&quot; through the next two years fishermen with his team , when the Supervisory Board will allow us to agree on both houses , until then in the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ liance , which still has 35 beds to be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the parish has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the hospital W@@ eil@@ heim is completed . &quot;
&quot; land@@ ed jo@@ ch@@ ner @-@ white , which also has chairman of the super@@ visory board , entered ru@@ m@@ ors , w@@ on@@ ach the house , which is in possession of the federal property , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this close I , as with the property goes on , yo@@ ke @-@ white could not say , there are several refl@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is a short @-@ time @-@ care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychi@@ atri@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; what we could not happen to us , such an occasion will not happen again , &quot; so fishermen about the Qu@@ asi Moving into the Le@@ ch , who had been received by the staff &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have worked as a che@@ que for over 30 years . &quot;
he asked to be asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the job of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was continually threatened by closing , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate victims of violence
an Tat@@ ver@@ d@@ joy@@ ous has led the police to the corp@@ ses of the last 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate .
&quot; in the trial , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old went to killed young people and put their corp@@ ses in one channel in rock@@ enhau@@ sen . &quot;
one since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ ol@@ ds from Rhineland @-@ Palatinate is a violence @-@ break to the victim .
&quot; the boys of the young lady was found at the evening evening in Rock@@ enhau@@ sen at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as tat@@ too , one also applies to the evening @-@ evening 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who has de@@ br@@ anded the specification , and investig@@ ators to the locality of Lei@@ che . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missed in the Sunday morning after having arrived at the eve of a autumn festival in Rock@@ enhau@@ sen .
in search of the young woman the investig@@ ators look at the personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the ear .
&quot; with respon@@ dents in the Fre@@ undes@@ er@@ as and famili@@ arity of the missing ones , the mer@@ ging was made up against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the mut@@ u@@ dly perpet@@ rat@@ ors led the police to a channel in rock@@ enhau@@ sen where the corp@@ ses were found .
&quot; the cancellation gave the authorities according to the police , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the corp@@ ses are placed in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be submitted to the Wednesday at the harbour , the investig@@ ators put him shelter on the burden . &quot;

refugees need accommodations : study war@@ ned of housing
the situation on the German residential market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees look for numerous bar@@ gains .
the pressure on the living market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distri@@ bu@@ tion@@ ists in the German residential market have long since begun .
&quot; with incoming refugees and seeking from the EU , more and more people are pushing on a market that already over@@ bur@@ dened in many major cities . &quot;
they comp@@ eting with income @-@ weak citizens around the last @-@ paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for payable apartments , would have to be built up to 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 every year . &quot;
&quot; to this result , a study is on behalf of the &quot; social @-@ debate &quot; social housing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , this year in Germany is 260@@ .000 units . &quot;
&quot; with this , it lacks 140@@ .000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees have no longer obligation to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial event . &quot;
many then encounter the housing market and rows into the long sn@@ akes in front of the apartment .
&quot; according to the following year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market lies not only to the rising refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction industry of the past few years .
&quot; for Germany it is movable , that from year to year is greater . &quot;
&quot; currently missing in the metro@@ politan areas already existed approximately 7@@ 70@@ ,000 units , by Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many Profession@@ als are therefore staying in big cities and stayed in WG rooms .
young adults stayed because of the built @-@ in on the home market un@@ optional longer at &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
in the big cities the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined in the last few years .
to solve the problem pro@@ poses the alliance &quot; Social @-@ construction &quot; a rest@@ art .
&quot; in this process , new incentives to boost social housing . &quot;
this could be disp@@ ens@@ ed on the basis of the underlying VAT and the basic tax for promoted apartments are free@@ zed .
&quot; in addition , to alliance attractive tax de@@ preci@@ ation options have been necessary . &quot;
the funding programme for refuge@@ e institutions of the state bank@@ rupt@@ cy is particularly good in towns and villages .
&quot; a week after the start of € 184 million , more than half of the available about 300 million euros have been launched at the end of 184 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be rep@@ aired . &quot;
refugees have Frei@@ du@@ ed : Croatia and Slovenia are cor@@ ridor .
&quot; there is practically no more people to go to Hungary , and over more refugees vote on the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage from Slovenia to north without a hur@@ d@@ les .
but dangerous is the route nonetheless .
Croatia wants to spend the establishment of a cor@@ ridor with the neighbouring country on the establishment of a cor@@ ridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Sloven@@ ian interior , and when it is necessary we will organise a cor@@ ridor , &quot; said the Croatian Minister of R@@ anko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and belongs to the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia has not yet reached a Schengen area .
&quot; after the off @-@ off of the Ser@@ bian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports of Croatian television station RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had t@@ apped his border for refugees on the court .
&quot; new laws passed on that same day into force , super@@ vis@@ cos@@ ity As@@ ylum procedures in Hungary is practically su@@ perf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to pass the refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare ourselves for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
Croatia &apos;s Croatian police raised the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most of the media are reporting between Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both bus and Ta@@ xen to the Ser@@ bian border city of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival it would have tried to go on foot over the green border to Croatia .
the refugees had not come across border to the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border .
&quot; for that , the border strips other threats : there are still sharp minus from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
Min@@ en@@ vi@@ ers should now create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closure of the border , there are little more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday he was the police of 366 re@@ challenged people .
&quot; just before the deadline on Monday , there were still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws stages the defeat and damage of the border ship to us as criminal off@@ ense .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed therefore 35 pen@@ al proceedings were initiated .
the twi@@ sted por@@ ters up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; according to the restrictions of immigration , one agreed on Tuesday in the newly set of 94 asylum application , almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; under the applicants , 13 families with small children are as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; at the Wedn@@ es@@ days , there were over 40 refugees . &quot;
&quot; however , no one has no more views to get granted in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe country country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be depos@@ ited there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke gathered only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began workers to come together .
they gathered together the tr@@ ash to leave the tenth of thousands across the past weeks on the road@@ side .
pl@@ ywood were built and one of the stick@@ ers in the border location was rebuilt .
&quot; for the purpose of this construction , nobody wanted to ou@@ gh@@ ten . &quot;
Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; around the 20.000 inhabitants , migrants were still held in the country . &quot;
in Salzburg there are about 1400 people waiting for travel to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German authorities in the morning .
in deal@@ er@@ ing met a regular smaller groups of refugees on foot .
may@@ or was &quot; bri@@ mming &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge @-@ festival on Sunday with the open spaces , when suddenly ten people stood with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent , &quot; as Wer@@ n@@ st@@ eins may@@ or Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to go to Passau by train . &quot;
&quot; but Germany on Sunday , but because of the refuge@@ e reservoir via the railway station was surprising to it , was for them in Wer@@ n@@ stein end , &quot; said Hal@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and the bases along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the river near Passau . &quot;
&quot; before , we had the ou@@ fl@@ ected guests only once ass , with j@@ ets and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring them to Passau by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Hal@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let him to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ le .
&quot; this gave us very happy , &quot; &quot; so urban . &quot;
&quot; the Tre@@ aties concluded were increased at the Sunday evening in Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Passau , in order to set it after the short notice , that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped yet , yet over the border . &quot;
but the regional train was put off at the Inn in front of the border in Wer@@ n@@ stein .
in Wer@@ n@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high in the course .
the bridge firmly linked with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ able and days before a branch bri@@ dging sport - organized by the Union Value of Wer@@ n@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent further z@@ ens of thousands of thousands , is a logical result of a very holy policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of working in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately at erection of structures , our Chancellor outlines high @-@ eastern and publicly co @-@ ordin@@ ated the attitude of the Hungarian government into the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
ly@@ re @-@ carrying of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing in the bor@@ derland with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the refugees will also have to determine that the &quot; yellow country , &quot; which it was invited and welcome , nothing but another refuge@@ e camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a big challenge , given the sustained refuge@@ e currents and the approaching winter , with us decent states for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad on the search for 35@@ ,000 six @-@ quarters Quar@@ ry
Konrad has filled with the refuge@@ e field to do all hands .
Christian Konrad is it used that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank in order to exp@@ ose lo@@ dg@@ ers for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first tak@@ eover center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has finally got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who had come from Monday to Austria , be without a big vor@@ tex , said Konrad and blessed the organizational &quot; master@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
the State Department was speaking of a &quot; kr@@ is@@ tical situation . &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad with a demand of 85@@ .000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ age year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , we have to be found even 35@@ ,000 accommodations in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the countries , 15,000 of the Bund . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without bott@@ oms , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the govern@@ ors it has already led to discussions .
these would have promised him to create reservations for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Ferry Ma@@ ier . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , which will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations of the As@@ ylum Co@@ ordin@@ ator also sets into the OR@@ F Promotion &quot; Hel@@ per as we do . &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodations .
&quot; in addition , one hopes to meet hotels that are empty during winter time . &quot;
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in case of not@@ ary , it could not be that Quarti@@ er@@ ders have to keep at a certain height of the tow@@ el size or size of the surface . &quot;
&quot; for a perpet@@ ual time would have to &quot; &quot; emergency &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that he is more successful in opposition to the State Department in keeping with his experience , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am a äl@@ er master which one does not say without further into the face .
belief force is its most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier , the Republic does not cause any costs as they themselves pronoun@@ ced . &quot;
your employees want them to increase it on three to four .
the own lo@@ dg@@ ers was not yet successful .
Conrad wanted to open a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there is clearly problems with the permit .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; first , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings like Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for keeping refugees plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary , because the person affected can still bring to those measures , the may@@ or of Klaus Lu@@ ger says ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , for the emergency , further locations are to be checked for their fitness . &quot;
criticism against the division of refugees in the federal state .
and other areas must contribute here to this post .
sea @-@ hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer tele@@ phon@@ ec@@ ate with the Bav@@ arian prime minister Horst Maritime hofer ( C@@ SU ) has corru@@ pted the next steps in the refuge@@ e survey .
she has in@@ sured me that the German boundaries will not be sealed .
the forwar@@ ding of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there will now be the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; special trains with refugees to Germany will not be there any more . &quot;
but the seek@@ ers would however be brought to Germany with regular journeys to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU Member States , P@@ ühr@@ s called once more increased solidarity in the refuge@@ e question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads to its borders again , is a logical consequence &quot; from the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next R@@ unt@@ astic is a question of time
the General Standard of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial command is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings the newly built IT group S &amp; T moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meter ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; in the IT are the clever cook@@ ers our raw materials - and we must try that they work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T @-@ Chef Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; it would be able to invest in Start@@ up @-@ companies of Die Neue Wer@@ ft , and later on which to act . &quot;
&quot; from the beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which promises a lot from Nieder@@ haus@@ er , &quot; &quot; the next R@@ unt@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.4 million euros have been invested in the site by S &amp; T in its location , 3.@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is sponsored by the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 27@@ 00 square meters in the building are rented apartments , for another 40 percent may give requests . &quot;

larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have a long time when I want to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the he@@ ater in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own itself Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has given Bre@@ it from her mother to the cradle .
I emerged in most when something developed and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so some woman with sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in ornam@@ entation , can also not answer the professional woman with last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag of any out@@ fit is being added .
the Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place , whose inhabitants will be called in@@ die . &quot;
&quot; this property connects man@@ cher also to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the U.S. president wants . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off @-@ law .
&quot; whether he express themselves stran@@ ger to foreign , journalists , or scientists are revealed or scientists in the international crisis policy - the applic@@ ant for the US presidential office will be in@@ complete with the elect@@ oral campaign . &quot;
and cuts well down here .
&quot; this will also be registered in the snow @-@ eastern K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the property ground@@ ing markets . &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ ing is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße .
man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ resident @-@ place is related about -@@ ty corners with it related .
&quot; his grandfather came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palatinate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in the elect@@ oral mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the vill@@ agers have to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that might find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed by her al@@ al@@ stad@@ ters , says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the b@@ aked chamber has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous jumps , to which beside Tru@@ mp also includes the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , which is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also too word - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
to the king of hearts he has not brought it there .
&quot; although he respect respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ den@@ ds the opinion that Tru@@ mp &quot; is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; wai@@ ved of the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - &quot; &quot; German : the offer , says it . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is thus out of the village of the in@@ amor@@ ous .
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began to 1885 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened in the USA a restaurant for gold@@ gr@@ ä@@ ber . &quot;
corner stone of the real estate concert was first par@@ cel sales in New York .
&quot; but life of grand@@ parents was not free from trag@@ ic : her desire to return to the home country , failed in the Bav@@ arian State , at which the Palatinate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once per@@ sec@@ uted without permission , the director of the Institute for Pe@@ dagog@@ ical History and Economics , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of a &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is in contrast to the included statements of the travel .
&quot; he repeatedly has repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the United States , and called for the construction of a border wall to det@@ ach illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; as the pol@@ der , that is not so sympath@@ etic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ related Tru@@ mp@@ s ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the Opa was born . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; &quot; he is always so open . &quot;
does he believes that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
he never takes care of K@@ all@@ stadt .
the pension ac@@ y@@ vert@@ ine c@@ on@@ ika mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz with a visit to something for the ch@@ urch@@ ins sp@@ ends which is generally well ank@@ ed .
&quot; this can I be imag@@ ined by the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they f@@ ests it better if he has not emp@@ ower the choice , because &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; when those who had at the time of his grandfather in the US the chase had , had been as if he , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B@@ ühler . &quot;

&quot; my president is not , &quot; says it . &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial star of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ina Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently de@@ wit@@ ted father who ex@@ cludes with his two children in the New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 219 million spect@@ ators . &quot;

the result of yesterday evening rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strongly with 1,@@ 136 million list@@ eners and cutting easily The block ( 8@@ 38@@ .000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the last three votes survived : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ? &quot;
secret reveal ? ...
&quot; Lana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly apparently , who wins The Bachelor wins &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor was finally un@@ veil@@ ed , was wr@@ apped in the biggest sec@@ recy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining vain girl will certainly not indicate whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and Lana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three 2 , book@@ able , you possibly have noticed an indication of who the winner will be . &quot;
Sam Wood holds his lips until the finale sealed on Thursday
&quot; all three women dropped sharp@@ ly about why wood is the perfect man and knew his sense of humor , am@@ bition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for this , why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is posed &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could their answers to the game ver@@ bal who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki saw both fast - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as best partner for wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ my energies noted , knowing that they were pretty compatible and I thought it was the whole course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the correct chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that they and Sam Wood were suitable as a couple .
&quot; from their view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week of her clear that wood &quot; the One &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pl@@ ain@@ able to set him off , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked to choose wood , when not them , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and Lana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 h , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in his move to the USA - and there were many other teams , sent to your impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some co@@ aches could have Hay@@ es for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a little angel , as it did the Aus@@ sie Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave them the next opportunity to play a P@@ unt Return , and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues his w@@ ah@@ res face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team from the mill , he encouraged her . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula fortified Hay@@ ne also publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ es was also encouraged by special teams @-@ coordin@@ ator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et to forget to forget his p@@ liable catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a P@@ unt which was restored in the first play@@ room of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings .
it was certainly not the start to had Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers for his N@@ FL Deb@@ t .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field and spoke later to the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he can &apos;t imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne se@@ ated the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ ü@@ t in 2007 , as a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a tr@@ y for Queens@@ land . &quot;

&quot; of course , the subject of As@@ yl the cl@@ or@@ ship will be collected , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;

&quot; so it is not going on , we need to be the causes &quot; , &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot;

4 people are killed after polic@@ emen k@@ ern@@ es at prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year young , were killed in the southern Nepal , after the police demonstrated rub@@ bers in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on the evening , in the district Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; Bis@@ hn@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad Dh@@ ak@@ al , the District Apostle said , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters were gathered outside a police station , taking some of you stones and fire @-@ bom@@ bs . &quot;
Mr Dh@@ ak@@ al said the police have used te@@ ti@@ as and then pushed into the air before she returns on rubber @-@ fin .
20 Pol@@ es and five civilians were wo@@ unded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber feet , of which is known that they may be killing , which is traditionally used as less fat@@ al alternative , obviously such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ al@@ ese southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of M@@ adh@@ esi say that new provinces come as part of the proposed new constitution to dimin@@ ish its political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of Ret@@ arus who want to have an own state .

&quot; killed , as the four large political parties signed an agreement , divide the country in provinces - an important step in the direction of a new constitution , but a very contro@@ versi@@ al theme in Nepal , which was centrally governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ure acceler@@ ated the process after the devast@@ ating earthquake that was killed in April thousands of people . &quot;

&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to bring 11 million $ for humanitarian organisations that sur@@ pass by the European nations , as they fle@@ e from the war and fle@@ e from war . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of the donations and rebel@@ lion on his blog .
&quot; instead of leaving a manager at the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about their personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; in our journey included many dark train and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but because the refuge@@ e and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are des@@ per@@ ately after help . &quot;
&quot; donations will go to four non @-@ profit organizations which provide help for refugees and migrants , physicians without borders , International Rescue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Google said that the first global donations collected up to a value of 5,@@ 5 million to g@@ oog@@ le.com / Trans@@ mit to 11 million $ . &quot;

for slightly overweight di@@ abe@@ tics can be counter@@ f@@ ade surgery helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live than those who do not @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the mort@@ ality dates need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , which wrote a condu@@ it to the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surger@@ ies or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absor@@ b food .
&quot; about the years obesity surgery proved to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes as effective , but most of the studies were performed on people experiencing the path@@ ological @-@ obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18,@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with BM@@ I over 30 are regarded as obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ gov / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study the researchers used of Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity surgery - medical treatments for type @-@ 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who under@@ went this surgery , s@@ ank from 31 to 24,@@ 5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the BM@@ I remained with the ones , the non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were received approximately at around 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected itself to surgical procedure , sol@@ dering for 36 % diabetes the diabetes is totally and at 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , the diabetes looked fully only by one percent and partly in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ ide and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
the researchers also super@@ v@@ ise the patients &quot; blood levels of Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c who reflects the blood sugar levels in the course of time .
Hem@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c is maintained most amongst 7 percent , write the re@@ searcher . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin is A@@ 1@@ c level of about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ emic control &quot; &quot; - as you reflect in the improved her@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mort@@ ality in five years , so the leading researchers Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the researchers are also able to earn average outcomes in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ yp@@ ass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18,@@ 7 v@@ s. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved bigger transi@@ tions in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 4 % v@@ s. 2.2 % ) and are more likely a complete over@@ coming of diabetes ( 46,@@ 9 % v@@ s. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival for the surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who died in obesity surgery , approximately 29 per cent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group which tried through conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not prove to be an advantage for survival on the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone , it is so@@ othing for individuals with BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or a kid@@ ney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accum@@ ulated these genetic changes , which have linked her body with obesity and diabetes is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
lovemaking history plays in H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a subject that is currently paying attention in the fiction : a young woman , too late and un@@ sight@@ ly , meets years of the flo@@ ck of her youth and he loves himself in them . &quot;

&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ r@@ er readers , as it plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it &apos;s impossible for anyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot receive all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refuge@@ e crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Ti@@ be@@ tic Buddh@@ ist leaders called on violence to the refugees in the hom@@ etown of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama said the problem of continued refuge@@ e crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford .
he ur@@ ged that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries were ad@@ mi@@ red on the refuge@@ e crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama was pra@@ ised in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to combat the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries can be created , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must reflect on how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama said the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack on September 11 and turned out that the US &apos;s violent reaction after the USA moved from un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after 11 September I have expressed my compassion in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he realized violence , and this has un@@ wa@@ ited consequences , &quot; &quot; the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase from intake of slopes disinf@@ ect@@ ants through children in the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ins centers in the US report on an almost 400 current increase in the number of children under twelve years , which can be used strongly in disinf@@ ect@@ ants , Georgia Tr@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , clim@@ ates the cases of revenue of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years , which will report the tox@@ ins centers , from 3.@@ 266 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are becoming more common in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the note , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children can des@@ pic@@ tured disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some of them are doing to impress your friends or because of a mu@@ cus in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ants can drink only because of a budget experience .
&quot; youths have sup@@ pose@@ dly mixed the disinf@@ ect@@ ant with soft dial@@ ect mouth , in order to obtain a tough@@ er drink . &quot;
younger children can be kn@@ itted from attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ don@@ ated .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange ri@@ ft , which are very appealing to the children . &quot;
&quot; Hän@@ de disinf@@ ect@@ ant contain somewhere between 45 and 95 per cent alcohol . &quot;
especially in to@@ dd@@ lers you can already lead a few sy@@ ringe at alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; told Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medi@@ cally Director of the Po@@ ison Centre in the hospital of K@@ ansas , the sender Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let so@@ ck whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year girl , which had recently taken four sy@@ ringe from after strawberry du@@ f@@ ection@@ ery @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school was brought in a notation . &quot;
&quot; your blood pressure was 179 , twice higher than the thres@@ hold , which is applicable at an adult than by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ job@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed their words and was not able to walk when they arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors flo@@ ck them overnight in a separate child disease house at the signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had b@@ aked the head , &quot; Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very fright@@ ening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ ahu &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fat@@ al for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants from the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ ison@@ ing out were some disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario were women in the sn@@ ails of hanging @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants which reveals a tox@@ ic , non @-@ declared ingre@@ dient . &quot;

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .

Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate rose from 5.4 percent over the UK@@ s of 5.4 percent as the statistics of the Bureau for National Statistical Statis@@ tics ( ons ) .
&quot; in the meantime , the employment in Scotland fell around 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
the employment rate for Scotland fell in the course of the quarter to 7@@ 4.7 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Perman@@ ent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the corner@@ stone for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year ago that Scotland &apos;s made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scot@@ tish labour market , with increased employment and decrease in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be witnesses of an Ex@@ ek@@ ution in Okl@@ ahoma
&quot; somewhat later today , except in a late legal intervention , I will see how a man brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the Okl@@ ahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in Okl@@ ahoma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p will be ex@@ hal@@ ted by the po@@ ison . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death .
&quot; the invitation took place for the first time in January on his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I have agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see in the USA and there are often more applications as places available , there is a mac@@ ab@@ ere lot@@ tery taking place to decide who is chosen . &quot;
Okl@@ ahoma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen to get rid of it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
I will sit beside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps of my friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with tele@@ ph@@ ate and a two @-@ half hours visit .
I like the guy .
&quot; we often lau@@ gh a lot , when we speak . &quot;
&quot; the prison officials say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Okl@@ ahoma blame me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the butter@@ fly as he wants and you get access .
I lo@@ wer@@ ed me to her .
&quot; she speaks one that &quot; &quot; it could have been better form@@ ulate &quot; &quot; but they still thinks that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it , even if he would do . &quot;
&quot; in fact , I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot;
but he wants to present an international re@@ por@@ ters to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the publicity work of the movement against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ por@@ er of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I will not go down here for all details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is inno@@ cent .
his actions after the ass@@ ass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would act him to be a benefici@@ ary of the act .
yet I believe that a strong lik@@ eli@@ hood is that he is not of the murder .
I believe it is not enough evidence to justi@@ fy a death .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to be truly objective .
others will give other re@@ por@@ ters to whom you can apply for this .
&quot; what you will get from me is , what it is said , to see a man an un@@ necessary death . &quot;
man according to mo@@ ist police @-@ hunt @-@ hunt @-@ hunt @-@ hunt @-@ hunt @-@ spring from the Cann@@ ing River
&quot; the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale Pol@@ z@@ abo@@ ard remained dry , when he sp@@ ake the man of the Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
&quot; an attempt to stop a man from Per@@ th to imp@@ ose the police was un@@ successful , when he found himself in the pe@@ er and su@@ mp@@ tu@@ ous waters , tried to get him g@@ ently to speak to the se@@ ash@@ ing . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to go to a budget building inci@@ dent in Beck@@ enh@@ am .
&quot; discovered how they discovered the susp@@ ects , tried to escape it towards the Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &apos; I come not out , come and get me , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about his univers@@ ality , so he turned up a reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; A good politi@@ cian to be negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
master@@ piece Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in the year 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to go into a alcohol @-@ control and tried to swim over the Swan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
&quot; Moody maintains that st@@ ew@@ ards tried to send him and threat@@ ens the racing sport , &quot;
&quot; Peter Moody maintains that st@@ ew@@ ards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his st@@ ables , and dro@@ be re@@ bu@@ ked the race immediately . &quot;
&quot; he ro@@ uted to the st@@ ew@@ ards and the integrity @-@ section of Racing Victoria and maintained that they have a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ i because of a racing day treatment , the last stra@@ w , on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moody said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always tried to do what is best for the racing sport and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt w@@ et@@ asting at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had with@@ held himself 18 months because of the sp@@ ying pre@@ y times , and didn &apos;t want it to see it as too high the grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say nothing about it , and I have long to eat for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that all at once arrives , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
you know that it extends .
&quot; sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I have said . &quot;
I will go home ton@@ ight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go about that main thing , and I want my owners think that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a personal coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moody &apos;s bom@@ b had tried in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the integration department had tried to send his stable . &quot;
&quot; prior to eight@@ een months , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stew@@ art in a room with a man - I will say - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I do within my st@@ alls , &quot; &quot; said Moody on rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly put in their n@@ oses , because they attempt to touch me out . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ y , president of the RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of RV@@ L , were aware of this at its times and are still today . &quot;
&quot; should I bring that to the view , that it is personally ? &quot;
&quot; since the RV@@ L has used itself and makes people outside of trainers , responsible for what is going on in the branch ? &quot;
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so badly for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and desp@@ ised me , and I have no doubt that what I say she is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t worry , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on her , and push her to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ str@@ ations level of trainers have built up with the long long cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to that he said he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moody &apos;s best known for its preparation for the un@@ trained Master C@@ avi@@ ar , designated the racing @-@ treatment rule &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after a pack carrier or a sound on the rac@@ ia had been applied to what the rules were b@@ ump@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I must assume full responsibility for this , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has been mist@@ ak@@ enly called on the B@@ ein .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday the whole day as it was .
but it also had such a racing day .
Moody could be faced with a three im@@ on@@ ati@@ gen cross @-@ qualification for treatment with the package on the racing day . an analysis of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who be@@ have these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moody . &quot;
man after riding and arrested
in the weekend the police took a man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent rides in Cob@@ ram .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y strikes against ri@@ vals because of asser@@ tion
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ am@@ y has been criticism of the tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; from two Premier League Favorites of the NR@@ L .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on said that the refer@@ ee will have allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; Ring@@ fight &quot; &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Fri@@ day@@ evening . &quot;
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ cos Trainer Wayne Ben@@ nett made an barely covered note to the Storm team , after his team had winning the final victory against North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys on the Saturday evening . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two of Queens@@ land did not be &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in the rings . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are concentrated only on their &apos; contact &apos; just on their &apos; contact &apos; .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his crew will keep him confident , since it is pre@@ y that they were worried to be be@@ aten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; that emerg@@ es up and again - I did not heard that Tr@@ ent Robins@@ on over ring @-@ fights , as she passed us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y am Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have changed nothing at our defensive system or the techniques , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es , and this has provided for us the te@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not really acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to lose , so it was a bit a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny as this is always blow@@ ing again in the season .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y was attacked Ben@@ net@@ ts idea from &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and re@@ minded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett was St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra , the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he &apos;s compared to the Saturday evening with our party on Friday evening , and how exciting her game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was when a boring team has been cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed , and Wayne said that he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team who can play and watch them as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game that you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt so they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried against us to play . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it comes to the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters had a higher result than the game Bron@@ che against Cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but this is an exciting game ? &quot;
or do you do Pau@@ sen and do not make a bit of exciting ?
for me it is the sched@@ ules .
&quot; if they mention ourselves , it means that we will meet at a stage still upon them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has free this weekend since they have the right to receive either North Queens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Sunday evening in the subur@@ b in A@@ AMI Park . ticket sales starts from next Tu@@ es@@ tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200@@ .000 $ deposit on drugs
&quot; a man , who may possibly have a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty because of his ver@@ su@@ ck , into possession of 40 kil@@ ograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were mu@@ g@@ ated by Queens@@ land , was released against a deposit of 200,000 each . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police was made 100 kg of the ch@@ ords on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America on a v@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c has been observed as he met his co @-@ def@@ endant in the marina during the early afternoon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Ro@@ adh@@ ouse where the police took 40 kil@@ ograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially necessary punishment for the attempt to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , ar@@ gu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been out of a harm@@ less reason . &quot;
&quot; judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an was worried about the flood of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , he bent the police on his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ cs mother and ste@@ pf@@ ather @-@ grandfather had offered a b@@ ail of 200,000 dollars as security in common to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the availability of the two people , it is clear that the issue of an security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; says Ju@@ dges Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from it , not appear , he war@@ ned . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was un@@ locked against deposit under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport st@@ amp@@ ed in the police daily and hold herself to a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .

St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone by girls to lo@@ red P@@ girl@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept in a online mess@@ aging service , received from which he received a number of un@@ employed pictures of children that were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl aw@@ oke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ eper ho@@ og@@ g .
&quot; it looked at it , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ arm@@ oured immediately their mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , analysed , then computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Tru@@ st@@ ating &quot; Web Search , which used concepts for searching for an ongoing work of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g maintained then opposite the officials , that he had done it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the internet &quot; &quot; and he then gave &quot; &quot; there , a polic@@ eman to sc@@ ure them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ at E@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sher@@ i@@ ff Court : &quot; he said , it would be a addi@@ ction , - that he may be addi@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the Su@@ chen were conducted on the computer of him , but said it was done because he wanted to asser@@ t a polic@@ eman to sc@@ ared to ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and the he asked to send more photos .
he said he did so to praise them .
&quot; he said he is sick in mind , when he drink , and said , he will see pictures of r@@ ape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ m@@ bling and the we@@ eping . &quot;
it then saw the un@@ decent images on the phone and con@@ front the acc@@ used .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the acc@@ used computer and Play@@ station did user to speak with girls who were much younger than he . &quot;

&quot; Defence Gregor S@@ im bat therefore , that H@@ og@@ g does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Trial , since you can ar@@ gue that &quot; no real sexual element &quot; in his understanding is to be found . &quot;
Sher@@ i@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mich@@ ael dism@@ issed the judg@@ ments until October to receive background information about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g is bor@@ row@@ ed in this case , but was kept due to hear@@ ings to other still im@@ partial cases . &quot;
he was still taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual pro@@ secution .

J@@ VA Berlin @-@ T@@ egel : five square meters cell are decent
&quot; the Bundes@@ ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht al has given a Ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling of Jus@@ tin T@@ egel right , the month of month was accommod@@ ated in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to the injury of their human dignity , prisoners would claim much claim to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitu@@ tional Court in a resolution published on Wednesday .
suffer@@ ers may even hope the judges even if they were locked into tight spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , a Ex @-@ H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in the Jus@@ tin Berlin @-@ T@@ egel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square metres ground floor ; the toilet was not separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who had already suspended access to the open cell according to the details of his wal@@ ker , into a larger cell . &quot;
his am@@ ber sh@@ aft@@ age because of the un@@ worthy liability conditions against the State of Berlin failed .
&quot; however , the ver@@ fassungs@@ gericht - lifted up the judgment of the chamber of Berlin and transferred to the case to re @-@ renewed test . &quot;
they are seeing the man would hurt of the man .
Kam@@ mer@@ dish does now decide about the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the ques@@ tion@@ able time only a few days may be rati@@ fied for compensation , be an equ@@ est@@ able claim . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a wor@@ ding of the legal protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot;
the Chamber of Kam@@ mer@@ dish must now clear the height of money damage .
the constitutional revolution has often often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; in April they spoke only in April an in@@ mate for harm , because he was bare in a cell . &quot;
&quot; moreover , human od@@ d is a decision between 2011 and also the multi@@ functional capacity of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe agreed to the Berlin Dec@@ Constitu@@ tional Court , adopted by a H@@ äf@@ t@@ ling in a Parall@@ el@@ fall in November 2009 an decent accommodation . &quot;
&quot; the dam@@ p Kl@@ äger was conducted over three months a day , between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons have come to the headlines across the past few weeks also because of missing workers .
&quot; prisoners will therefore always be included 23 hours , the aggression of aggression , even to bat , it should be on account because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; upon information on the Jus@@ tin &apos;s meeting , 21 places in T@@ egel because of supplements are not occupied , 19 should be exp@@ elled . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refuge@@ e policy : &quot; we create that &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers are coming to Germany after the forecasts of the Federal Ministry for Germany , according to the statement by vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to absor@@ b a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) expressed in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say once again and again : we can create that and we will create it .
what comes to Germany gives an overview of the following overview .
&quot; according to different forecasts between 35@@ 0000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , each year - and the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 25@@ 0000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space but above all with affordable prices : annual from 600@@ 00 to 800@@ 00 social housing from the rent connection , and around these particularly favorable apartments will also apply refugees . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister of Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the promotion , from currently 518 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is this from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing annually , and this would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in fact , scientists and the Federal Ministry is in fact that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in the housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the estimates by the Institute for labour market and occupational research , it is that long @-@ term 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not be asked even systematically after their qualification to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project management for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether it can be found in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the admission fee , but also for self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says mig@@ r@@ ation for@@ chan@@ ger Diet@@ rich Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ u@@ hardt , there has been a political turning point : from the unemployment ban on refugees to recognition of labour . &quot;
&quot; while it used to be a working ban for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the resi@@ dences of asylum seek@@ ers at a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the qualified labour force - mostly the view is set aside from the access to the labour market should be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
a big hur@@ d@@ le for access to the labour market is lack of German .
&quot; until now , there is still no failure of offer in general and calm @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also indicate that jobs are most often convey@@ ed by personal contacts .
the construction of networks therefore is therefore a view of the Thr@@ issu@@ us of the König@@ s@@ weg for the working integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only few refugees &apos; parents give up their children to the kit@@ esur@@ fers , estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the different parents &quot; , &quot; it says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sch@@ ema , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless , to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ b@@ room in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the demand for educ@@ ators greatly increase by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacity - about by giving more specialized schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared for students without any previous knowledge of welcome classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained Te@@ achers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teaching , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shor@@ tage , &quot; says Be@@ ate St@@ em offers from the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German student werk is estimated that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle not a State of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ating the studies - the only exception was previously Berlin , inter@@ sen@@ ator Frank H@@ enkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its attitude . &quot;
&quot; for studying refugees , access to the college could be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; for refugees with a basis of residence or disp@@ ens@@ ation shall receive no performances after the asylum seek@@ ers , if they start a student . &quot;
&quot; the latter is generally not an BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they fall not under the circle of inf@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; obj@@ ul@@ ant refugees had to have lived in Germany so far , to be entitled to claim BA@@ Fö@@ G @-@ eligible , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this sp@@ ying can be shorten@@ ed for 15 months . &quot;
&quot; these funds must also be closed , call Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will be playing a more important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should follow Islam suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely the same rights as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ churches can develop into a new state religions .
&quot; it would also be the foundation of a Islamic prosperity @-@ association , which takes care of the fort@@ night . &quot;
to the rights are also obligations .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on a clear contact person and be ready to work with the state in many areas and to make certain contro@@ versi@@ al . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to enter against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be registered to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to Australian such conflicts in Germany , &quot; they immediately got their right to stay here in Germany , he said , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will be in future a lot more than today an issue of society .
the majority of society will also have to change the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Germany - as a result of European decisions , has been a anti @-@ discrimination law , and a general gender equality law since a scar@@ ce decade . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns how slow , as the N@@ SU series showed , in the police and authorities , the rac@@ ist motive systematically ignored . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migration organisations and interest groups are non @-@ called for long and weigh@@ ed to international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention , must be effective in the coming years if the country will remain peaceful and its new people should be able to benefit from it - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally , Germany has been able to supply refugees to so far , Doc@@ tor@@ ate President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , there must also be extra money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , every com@@ ers can equ@@ alize in the registration of health @-@ types . &quot;
services could be eliminated later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long run it is highly ques@@ tion@@ able , so many people meet with the limited highest @-@ performance catalogue , which prevents the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors made especially creating the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far so far , the Berlin health academic The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven , immigrants get worse off their diseases as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in doctors practi@@ tioners , interpre@@ ting contact costs . &quot;
&quot; though , many refugees would also have helped with more general medical procedures in the emergency @-@ patient . &quot;
and with another diagnostic eye .
they were given a lot more un@@ tr@@ aded with refugees and for young people there is about HIV clari@@ fication .
&quot; with the partial other disease images German doctors made by their training , but clear , suppose Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite clean@@ se or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to realize &quot; . &quot; and what the doctor of adver@@ t affects , be caused by the refugees or even relief in sight . &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed education system , several refugees would be even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice it , however , they would have to im@@ itate their qualification and wom@@ ens again testing once again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany were sick after estimates of the disease psych@@ otherap@@ ic chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) mentally ill : most suffer from injury @-@ traum@@ atic exposure , or among depression . &quot;
&quot; we are particularly vulnerable to refuge@@ e refuge@@ e , explained Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of TU München demonstrates that every 5th Syrian refuge@@ e calendar is traum@@ atis@@ ed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering to an post @-@ traum@@ atic exposure of exposure , suffering from others to so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with respir@@ atory , ver@@ z@@ zin@@ del , du@@ g@@ ases and deaths . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleeping and concentr@@ ations , heavy har@@ ass@@ ness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; preventing the symptoms of chron@@ ically , whether an early treatment is necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ic cranes obtain refugees a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; in this case , psych@@ ic cran@@ ke asylum seek@@ ers can place an application for psych@@ otherapy , but this usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social offices mostly Non@@ workers or doctors who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;

&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;

for over 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family pro@@ b@@ st for more than 33 years .

abuse in the attitude of circulation are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ b@@ st also takes position : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; how they are lov@@ ingly called , will be read by the eyes of every wish of the eyes . &quot;
we want to cooperate with the animals and have fun with them .

Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe ( Mr Mu@@ en@@ er leaders ) fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ released but the video of the fall was quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; the Parliament opening was also di@@ mm@@ ed by the vote of the opposition from the opposition , that they had anonymous death threats and they had war@@ ned that they were given to accompany the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ u@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; last month she had b@@ alled him and interrupted it in the Parliament for his talk about the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech , which he was repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the speaker of the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven Op@@ tical politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they war@@ ned them , Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not indicated , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot;
&quot; they war@@ ns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in the parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;

Hewlett @-@ Packard gets up to 30.000 jobs
Hewlett @-@ Packard is expected to expand 25@@ .000 to 30.000 jobs as part of the restructuring and savings @-@ up efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will spare parts established later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its servic@@ ing operations .
&quot; the expected job quar@@ ry leads to a load of more than 2,@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures become a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive which should guide the unit according to separation . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise is smaller and stronger focused than it is HP today and we have a wide and deep portfolio of shops that help companies move to a new style of business .
&quot; as an independent company , we are better placed than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
Hewlett @-@ Packard Enterprise has more than 50 billion US annual revenue and &quot; will be focused on providing far @-@ reaching , integrated technology solutions for companies . &quot;
it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hewlett @-@ Packard and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage one has called the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley .
HP has a massive restructuring to run the conversion from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC @-@ manufacturer and one of the largest US tech company , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team p@@ ic face the front of the front against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; turning point compared to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and unless his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he could not play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still un@@ certain . &quot;
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended the last season after a separate dum@@ plings who had ended up and then returned to its old tail during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threat@@ ening the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that is not well healed . &quot;
this is no longer matter .
that was only an accident .
it was not in conjunction with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries he had previously had .
&quot; this may be true from purely medical perspective , but like stran@@ ger also recognized , there are the associated risk of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd identi@@ fies 23 different diseases of Wil@@ be@@ ers since his debut in six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als as 157 Liguria in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider image for ar@@ sen@@ al is that they have been in six out of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a devil , but ar@@ sen@@ al believes that an improvement in the infringement rate will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes if you come back from an injury , you have a sus@@ cep@@ tible period of time , a time where you will gain your body and gain strength force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome the .
&quot; I hope to stabili@@ zes his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will walk a career in the way he deserves . &quot;
ar@@ sen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on the next Wednesday , and turning a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; Hé@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , what means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and The@@ o Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players who need it , a little break @-@ up , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; even though ar@@ sen@@ al clear membership are , by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ tim@@ id@@ sive effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ be@@ aten to 41 games once the &quot; &quot; defe@@ ated &quot; &quot; campaign launched in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sh@@ aken on Tuesday evening by a earthquake , whereby at the Rich@@ ard@@ sk@@ ala 3,@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; turning point is the opinion that ar@@ sen@@ al has drawn the doctrine of the past season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains of the distant hope , with its management to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ al tri@@ umph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked with ar@@ sen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 but on the other hand , I am long enough in business to realistic too . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy @-@ show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need@@ y for men to open themselves , now even more des@@ perate than ever before , like hem@@ orrho@@ des among young men at a 15 @-@ year @-@ show . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important th@@ urs@@ ache in men at the age of 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem announced the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ en ( calm - campaign against a inher@@ ited life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of asking the culture to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart piece in the fight to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study conducted with more than 2000 high school students with de@@ press@@ ants symptoms , that when the pas@@ sions had a sufficient high percentage of friends with healthy mood . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , half a circle of mentally healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one must first have made friends , so that a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more social media , communicating with its focus on style about substance is the in@@ medi@@ ability of the answer often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , li@@ fel@@ ong and successful , doubles , even though in reality the isolation . &quot;
&quot; this super@@ ficial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psychological and psych@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health a lot more deep . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
&quot; the Beautiful at Friends was , that this shift was put on the head . &quot;
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which impres@@ ses by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler of the frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football gu@@ esses and the lon@@ ging of R@@ oss to Rachel - all this came out of knowing that men can definitely return to explore full their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phon@@ eu@@ vre it to me : ... &quot; &quot; my wil@@ der role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ mur@@ dered , has really shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel in a position to talk with friends .
&quot; the old re@@ application &quot; &quot; I come with it right &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows , which comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cre@@ m@@ ation mechanisms . &quot;
it presents quite clearly the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status over the phone to people in moments of desp@@ air also help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with the ceremony of the day completely new designed setting , why don &apos;t take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or even better , if you are sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know which difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent at Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the whole 236 episodes - for the Friend@@ ship Fest
&quot; di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to z@@ erm@@ al@@ men &quot;
angel Di Maria celeb@@ rates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ thi@@ di and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against mal@@ m@@ ö .
&quot; di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani kept course , as Paris Saint @-@ Germain its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ c@@ ater stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League G@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G players , who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before they finally achieved their lead when Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they seek not only qualification for the King &apos;s lap , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was no class@@ game of Laurent Blan@@ cs Team with Zlat@@ ko I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovi@@ cs missed chances in front of his home country and against the club , with whom he began his illustr@@ ate career already in 1999 , changed . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to gain home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win back to our opponents issues and back relaxed even if there are certain things we have yet perf@@ ected during the season , &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet sco@@ red one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend of a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on their own place at Bordeaux in the First League , but he was eliminated in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ stor@@ ms was known as the man who took over to the next level in Europe , when he went to the next tier in Europe , and he pointed out , why , when he went to the next month of Manchester United , before he finished in Johan Wil@@ and over beautiful in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if any one believed that PS@@ G would win a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off was proposed to reach this level , joined by An@@ pi@@ ff with nine nationalities on the field and was upgraded with a five @-@ man defense and two deep inside middle ground . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , the far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 34@@ th minute , they offered little over the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself had sometimes focused on , with some fail@@ ures and bad deals , not least by I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , which was not less than five sellers in the first half and then abandoned , after Cav@@ ani had set him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he pointed out much more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic , the Di Maria was raised in a fil@@ med Forces of Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd Minute most ... &quot;
the second gate fell short after the hours brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Uruguay reached its sixth stage after I@@ bra@@ him@@ ovic had flow@@ ed a left flan@@ ke of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all thoughts on that Malmö can return to the game , and just stopping an excellent input of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz , could stop the end result before the player E@@ ze@@ qui@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected by the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ eide , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish le@@ ague , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification @-@ games do not range from . &quot;
hat from before Paris !

&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; classi@@ fy Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked , with bel@@ lied in@@ believing and called &quot; ho@@ o ! Wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown concluded the Produ@@ cers of Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to call people to think about it - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it is a sp@@ line which is be@@ aten by their white refu@@ ges . &quot;

&quot; Twitter @-@ User Mr Po@@ oni expressed his wo@@ w about the clip by saying , Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that is SO BRI@@ G@@ ISS that it does hurt . &quot;
&quot; the Twe@@ et has served more than 5,000 Ret@@ ets and 4.000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ ons comments come to a time , at the precise racial reproduction in the media at the top of the social discussion . &quot;

&quot; American Nin@@ ja Warrior &apos;s first Champion
&quot; professional clim@@ bers and operator to Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first Ath@@ let , which won the American Nin@@ ja Warrior on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ with home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which ended straight their 7th season , had never experienced a contest @-@ participants who could finish all levels of his obstacle . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finale . &quot;
on the last task the climbing was belon@@ ged to a 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; passed the task within the time , making he the first Ath@@ let was completed , which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 by American Nin@@ ja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended up full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to the hard @-@ fight victory , still under shock over the profit of the Great Price of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or to life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his p@@ ile money . &quot;
so quite suddenly .. how I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the executive producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ por@@ ters to discuss the final and why B@@ ritten , although he has been first performing the par@@ cours , not any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money is transferred to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , he receives the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and the life changed ; he receives the great gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he was al@@ um@@ ph@@ ate about it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a terrific guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be be@@ aten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac could have as felt , if they had he@@ eded the roles . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers slim at Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; previously , they were one of the best teams in the Bas@@ eball , today the tiger is standing at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as sp@@ o@@ iler and played this part however on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
&quot; the tw@@ ins ended up a chance for Ascension in a season of Houston Ast@@ ros , for the second American League game . &quot;
&quot; Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F words that was so hard to grip on over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all vict@@ ories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Un@@ mus . &quot;
Tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support as the first three times in the first two inner p@@ inn@@ ed then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) chosen 6 times in the 1 / 3 inside and made three install@@ ments .
it has only been his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I will end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to throw at the Bull@@ pics of each game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game . &quot;
the designated tiger @-@ h@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hit and was in two R@@ uns off his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has sh@@ aken the stroke well , &quot; said Un@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( h@@ eck training ) , looked much better in the bull@@ dog , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three rings in the back at the end of the seventh , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der Byr@@ on Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a B@@ unt , and Simon carried his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier on Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was faced , before the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ keywords Miguel S@@ ano , who took a two @-@ run &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finish @-@ run on the second brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a Double Play .
it was this in the major le@@ ague &apos;s leading 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play
after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings added an Insurance Run , created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ do and reached the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed st@@ ach however S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for its fifth download .
Detroit prof@@ ited for the pre@@ lu@@ de of the game of an still not movable Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three aces in the first two inner against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the injury @-@ list after having been missing for more than one month ago .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I requested I said , &quot; said Mr Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt wo@@ unded when I got stuck and sens@@ ed that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ched there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hai had a single at Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ Out Walk for J@@ .D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the play Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play the middle &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z Shar@@ es its 0 @-@ 21 track series with the power@@ ing in the sc@@ oring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , what the threat ended . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers made in the second to achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
he didn &apos;t take a well be@@ aten track but he caught the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Coun@@ t . there was no points in the third In@@ ning before he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed over J.@@ S .
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits and a walk with four lines . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez schied for a violation of the root of saus@@ age .
he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws that operates the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the injury @-@ down list , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the off@@ setting list is lined to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;

the EU states have not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
the EU &apos;s ministers will want to take a new start on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees next Tuesday ( 22 September ) .
&quot; in the light of the strong refuge@@ e Gulf in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ up and distribution of men . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation led this together with the countries , she announced Merkel in the late evening after almost four @-@ hour discussion with the prime minister in the office of Berlin . &quot;

Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the inc@@ ense 1510 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as commented .
his negative impressions makes it possible to strengthen him with histor@@ ians in his later fight against Rome .
&quot; Lu@@ ther had brought the division of the comm@@ uted church with his d@@ unge@@ ons , into the division of the Russian Federation . &quot;
Hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ scr@@ one is one of the main pieces , the Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written and updated the introduction and scri@@ pting texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now has been published with gorgeous images . &quot;
at the beginning the picture was formulated for Ot@@ mar alt that formulated bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 moti@@ fs .
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - what is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , according to the respective topics , it can quite seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; around three years the Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project , for whom he met a subjective artistic choice from the many thematic areas of &quot; book of all books &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have written cycles , which devote themselves topics like cross @-@ du@@ g , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ ther@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; with this he has fascinated the same number of partners , this holds true for the Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his emphasis on artwork . &quot;
and since it is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost based on painting with the respective Bible points .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible Study of Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and is translated into today , in current contex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are like ver@@ bal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible Study of Martin Lu@@ ther , and a phr@@ ase of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts of the respective situation . &quot;
the jewelry Coll@@ ar has gold letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old equal to twice a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately born out of rede@@ emer for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar alt , 1940 in Wer@@ nig@@ ero@@ de and raised in Berlin , comes from a family , which belon@@ ged to the strict Protest@@ ant Moravian River . &quot;
&quot; then the education has happened with the tu@@ stock , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work up , so maybe to carry me again with the Lord Father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art in fast @-@ living time again to more importance : &quot; the perception of imaging is now shaped by re@@ kl@@ ame , and that is noisy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displ@@ aced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always been some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ os@@ aur . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let himself see the viewer in the pictures , &quot; let them work in themselves and feel what strength they have : &quot; the picture looks for his counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost opened on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; always been a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art : &quot; I like , as he compreh@@ end with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I never desp@@ ised the Bible entirely to compreh@@ end the Bible , but also selected for him that are important , even mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; that was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for se@@ ven@@ ience both the ( Bi@@ blical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - pap@@ er- and linen @-@ transform@@ ations - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened on the 15th of November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
construction course for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned , pe@@ aters for a round trip . one year later was almost everything finished - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway has been finished again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration for displ@@ ay@@ ings , especially with the residents who had not toler@@ ated the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hill looked up , new place were looking for - now with a formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission will go in October , I was able to announce the first community of Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children and Youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it sol@@ ves then without &quot; &quot; additional commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works in the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 - the Bundes@@ liga are regarded as a clear sign in the weekend .
the soccer re@@ acts to that of the p@@ inn@@ ate situation in Germany and assu@@ res its policies to tackle the problems addressing the related problems .
&quot; I think this is the greatest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there cannot be no one thing in principle , that &apos;s nothing about doing nothing . I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in every individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensi@@ fy the refuge@@ e situation in Germany intensive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am next Wednesday in the registr@@ ar and re@@ efs there the State Department in Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since then the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; announced itself . &quot;
the soccer can and wants to help .
but the decisive s@@ ne@@ sts must follow the policies .
the German Bundes@@ liga has therefore extended its refuge@@ e initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we have ensured that this program is up to 2019 , &quot; stated N@@ ier@@ sbach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
&quot; also , some Federal authorities help this program . &quot;
&quot; already at this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ er set a clear sign when they will take place on the left tri@@ angles instead of the otherwise usual sponsor@@ ing logos ( Herm@@ es ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We will help - # expl@@ aining &quot; &quot; welcome . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should be able to help where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ ver@@ ada Sport@@ sman Ru@@ di Fi@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; Zeitung ( Tuesday ) and awarded the project as &quot; Self @-@ compreh@@ ensi@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; the refuge@@ e feature passes everyone , none may not be able to see . &quot;
&quot; we can call soccer Bundes@@ liga , no , we need to use our strength to our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly bu@@ dding , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ airy , CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication game against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ier@@ sbach spoke the support of refugees as a &quot; &quot; a large joint work in German football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 lic@@ en@@ closures were started in their places their own projects was great .
&quot; so great is , small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
in this and next year the association represents 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government .
&quot; the clubs have already called the total amount for 2015 , &quot; commented N@@ ier@@ sbach . &quot;
reports : SAP R@@ eig@@ sch@@ ef loses an eye in an accident
&quot; the pioneer of Europe &apos;s largest software Group , Bill Mc@@ Derm@@ ott , has had lost several reports by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stair@@ way in the house of his brother in the United States he would like to flo@@ at after midnight in the left hand , he carried the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost ble@@ eding , was power@@ less , then came out of tow@@ ed on the road - that he has told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ Co @-@ founder &quot;
Mc@@ Derm@@ a could go after his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the meeting meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 year old manager will be at the meeting and &apos; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ a announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; ( Thursday diary ) , he will come back to Germany again in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP da , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I got the whole time in a regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman , Haz@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Derm@@ a of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Derm@@ a sp@@ ends commonly between Germany and the US , but since summer it was no longer in the German SAP Head@@ quarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ m@@ ish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ter@@ ned a corresponding photo and explained , he caused the injury to be thrown by wheel than he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
&quot; he therefore comes with night @-@ up in Singapore at the weekend as a reserve driver for the two St@@ am@@ mp@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button to question how one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia , all the hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of the Europa League will take final count . &quot;
the National player becomes the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga even in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 o / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ top@@ game will be back again against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open to the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; considering the high load of his pros , Tu@@ ch@@ el will change his st@@ amp@@ or not only at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ e@@ position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller continues to take place in the place of stem Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , pra@@ ised the football teacher the world master . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller continues to work in all Europe @-@ League games , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high degree of probability , it also becomes the second game . &quot;
the research statement from fellow @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ al@@ enter for BV@@ B in the Europa League will be the target that means mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for compreh@@ en@@ sible : &quot; this makes Marco not so wrong .
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot auto@@ focus : government wants to support Germany
Germany should be pione@@ ers according to the will of the Federal Government in the change of the cars .
&quot; the federal state is decided on Wednesday a strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier from the house of traffic @-@ ini@@ sts Alexander do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( C@@ SU ) , which is among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the I@@ AA from a &quot; &quot; new mobile era &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less st@@ ems , do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states , which can also meet with representatives of the industry at the I@@ AA . &quot;
the Strateg@@ i@@ ep@@ ap@@ ier of the Tourism Department , inter alia , the importance of mobile broad@@ band engineering and an additional shift to digital radio . &quot;
the testing of new technology is currently being created a test track on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; to allow the driver &quot; &quot; no additional adher@@ ence to risk &quot; , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework conditions , and where necessary to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , Germany wants to stand up internationally for ensuring that the per@@ missible extra speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is lifted from 10 to 130 km / hour / hour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government also wants to fight for a change in the Vienna convention , so far only the people had seen as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in an automated driving takes an increasing the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology mainly focuses on sensors and cameras that collect the environment and process the data in seconds .
&quot; after one of the Ministry of Economic Affairs , a highly automated driving on motor@@ ways to 2020 will be technically fe@@ a@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the vehicles on the public streets are to be expected only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the site Germany value the authors of the study for 2025 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the KW@@ P can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Transport S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
the question of liability in accidents and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clear however .
&quot; even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are skep@@ tical , but much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA specified survey of the For@@ sa @-@ Institute on behalf of the audit@@ orium DE@@ K@@ RA will come to the result , that only eight percent of the Germans are convinced that , 32 percent do not reck@@ on in 20 years therefore , 31 percent do not believe in at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es up to 2025 with autonomous cars , in the US 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; if the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely on a self @-@ vehicle vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of digital associations , Bit@@ k@@ om would only accept seven percent , control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , they could add 15 percent in flu@@ ent traffic at least 15 per cent in the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
well every fourth would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM off
the dis@@ sert@@ ation wants to present day with the title will fight only in the single market from September 25th to October 4 .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot;
the guys have experienced it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strongly enough , even without Tim@@ o the title &quot; , &quot; said Bun@@ dest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf near the EM @-@ Tutorial in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long term agreed upon sponsorship in China .
the 34 years old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Tim@@ o is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated single @-@ European Cr@@ am@@ aster Dim@@ it@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who runs the se@@ ap@@ list in J@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also remembered the EM 2013 in Sch@@ mid@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Tim@@ o has also been missing , and we are europe@@ am@@ masters . &quot;
&quot; because of this we should be guided , &quot; explained the world @-@ step @-@ fifth . &quot;
the English soccer player Luke &apos;s Sha@@ w of Manchester United has attributed a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of very big Mo@@ den@@ schau and a guard figures : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich on Wednesday .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which are due to video @-@ proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , which led among others with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the Mo@@ des@@ olo - and therefore , that he put men in red @-@ light . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the grand@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; previously it was so easy , in the meantime it is genuine , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From civil walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 to at the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , is it a luck that the fashion catch his beginning has changed his beginning to have changed his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , for &quot; &quot; for me a show was a bit &apos; of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made in the Canadian Montreal and in Paris Station before .
&quot; it is about as much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the hard work of the man , the fashion story written without ever going to have a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically is the show not built , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall kunst@@ werk , which has been operated by the lot of effort : to medium the doll@@ s , for example , a sty@@ list was engaged . &quot;
14 tonnes material have ra@@ vel@@ ed the poles according to indications of the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
just before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a leather p@@ ouch with cor@@ set .
Heidi meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are sl@@ ur@@ ning than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ti@@ ers old T@@ eddy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ous t@@ ch obe@@ dience of the design . &quot;
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his T@@ eddy Bear and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; to play with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed to him . &quot;
the dem@@ oli@@ tion of fashion he then turned into himself on a later stage .
he realized mo@@ de@@ magazines and looked at the dr@@ afts of other designers such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later , I bought this one . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he can not pay the models .
&quot; they were given nothing , they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a mode @-@ niche
it used to be@@ g the long embro@@ ider@@ y equipment in and around Pl@@ auen .
&quot; the bes@@ tial substances and tips were created in great quantity for customers , which they pass on for example to blan@@ kets and curtains . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the fashion slots . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener peak , fashion played a major role , was then pushed back through the home @-@ textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , accessories such as bags and for regional tra@@ der . &quot;
&quot; ever , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion that addresses the past p@@ le@@ po@@ et , an increasing customer potential . &quot;
&quot; who are not served in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer available on the market . &quot;
with us they already make half of all orders .
Mo@@ desp@@ ances Pl@@ auen has worked together with nine further companies in the industry association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may have the propri@@ etary label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , roughly 80 per cent of the revenues have been broken . &quot;
private stores and the wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly available to customers in this path .
today the mass ware is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
&quot; furthermore , the export of export , up to Russia and to the US . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points about environmental awareness , such as Cor@@ d@@ ula Bauer of the embro@@ ider@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein , &quot; &quot; since this year we have leading quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially responsible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt complet@@ es : &quot; this refers to the materials used .
diploma thesis Ute Schmidt teaches at the Snow @-@ eber@@ ger of the West@@ ro@@ ächs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter@@ ing the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories that have to think especially economically , &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design often is only easy to adjust to a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago animated textile design of Kat@@ i Re@@ uter the historical snow @-@ re@@ tip new .
the machine stretches along a few places small chic@@ ks .
&quot; inspired by the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schmi@@ ed@@ ance in Bianca Hall@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Kr@@ au@@ ach , &quot; &quot; I could not begin with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they use the sn@@ eb@@ all@@ point for their jewelry .
in an elaborate procedure she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to clients , whose ancestors have lived in Pl@@ auen and surroundings , and who like to take over a mem@@ ento . &quot;
I see my jewelry as a modern amb@@ assador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly &quot; however , it is not about a re@@ produ@@ ci@@ zation but a sort of continuation , the 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family Banks in times of the world economy crisis in England .

XI pushed forward to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open up broader public to foster growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should devote themselves to enhance foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve strategies for business meetings , &quot; he said in an appointment at the 16th session of the Central leadership group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new business and advance reforms , new momentum and vitality will bring new momentum and new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regul@@ ate the market process , relaxation of the border controls policies , promoting the state agencies ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ hau@@ l of the local residents of mel@@ ting system . &quot;
&quot; the statement is created a negative list , which sectors and companies are identified for investment not to come into question . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved through testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it indicates the market a major role in the allocation of resources , a legally @-@ state business environment , and the market place open , said the statement . &quot;
the government also deals inspec@@ tions about the powers transmitted by the powers and ensure that companies choose how to carry out their stores .
&quot; the statement also said that China &apos;s border regions will allow , to explore new models of cross @-@ border operation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; open sectors in the context of an offer , public controlled sectors will open further areas for private investment . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investments and will protect the right@@ ful interests of foreign companies and deliver better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for fore@@ igners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; , &quot; the requirements optimized and the application process can be facilit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a session . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as was reported in a meeting published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury in pre@@ dat@@ ory
the European Commission wants double @-@ double the thres@@ hold for mer@@ cury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory and consumers by means a significantly higher dose of the neur@@ ons .
&quot; the consumer organisation De@@ watch , which is a proper working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans &quot; &quot; risks and side @-@ effects def@@ ective industry@@ - and environmental policy are passed with full weighing on pregnant and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; &quot; declared Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt from food@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; in Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the thres@@ hold of the ner@@ ve gi@@ f@@ le for big fish at the end of the food chain like about Hai@@ - or s@@ word@@ fish made of &quot; economic reasons &quot; &quot; from one to two milli@@ gram Mer@@ cury , are raised by kil@@ ograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , big pre@@ dat@@ ory fish , however , be so strongly stra@@ ined by mer@@ cury that can not be sold on the basis of the still current limits of about 50 per cent of the F@@ aul@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling of the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be irre@@ ver@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; in return for this Lock@@ ing , the EU wants to food@@ stuff the thres@@ hold values in other fish of currently 0,5 milli@@ gram on 0.1 milli@@ gram of mer@@ cury per kil@@ ograms . &quot;
&quot; however , however , these are referred to as &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller counter @-@ fish , such as carp , are mostly viewed as low , that they have already stopped the planned maximum values . &quot;
