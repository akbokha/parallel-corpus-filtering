&quot; C ) In establishing the community , the organization is ready to consider reference data that considers the community as a particularly protective necess@@ ities in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; the organization does not need material handling , unless they remain accessible to the organisation in the community room without further accessible via the organization . &quot;
a ) i ) The organisation will take care of the association &apos;s consent as to the nam@@ ing Inspec@@ tors of Inspec@@ tors for the States .
II ) Dis@@ solves the community either against a proposed nam@@ ing or at any time against one of the pro@@ claim that the organisation of the community and the States proposes one or several alternative methods .
&quot; III ) If due to the repeated turn@@ out of the community , the designation of Inspec@@ tors of the organization is attributable to leading inspec@@ tions , the Council assumes that the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; Director General &quot; is thus entitled to meet suitable measure . &quot;
B ) The community and the affected states under@@ take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually apply to them after their Convention .
C ) The visits and activities of the organization will be established so that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspec@@ tions of peaceful nuclear activities as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organisation for knowledge of the confi@@ dential information provided .
&quot; each state is turning towards the organization , including assets , funds and funds , as well as compared their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the relevant provisions of the agreement on the privileg@@ es and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will be terminated in terms of core material , if the community and the organization has been dil@@ uted or dil@@ uted in a way that it is used for nuclear power , which is not usable or practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the implementation of this Convention , the Community announces the transfer of nuclear material from the states that the securing measures are subject to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will be terminated in terms of core material , as soon as the receiver , as stated in this Convention , on which the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization will execute documents , from which every transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ use of securing measures on the higher core material . &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , nuclear material , the securing measures according to this Convention is to be subject to non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , as agreed , the community with the organization of such an use of materials , under which circumstances can end the securing measures after this agreement in reference to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle will not be used for the process of non @-@ application measures according to this agreement for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ n body .
B ) The organisation and community meet a provision that the securing measures should not be applied only as long as the core material used in this Convention .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these securing measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures are once again applied in this Convention , as soon as the core material is taken into a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be held over the total amount and composition of this in the relevant state , or by the current states , or by the relevant countries such as such material from this state or states . &quot;
&quot; this explains how quickly as possible ; it extends to matters like amongst others , contemporary and proce@@ dur@@ ations of reporting , but does not exclu@@ de a billi@@ on@@ ment or under sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of military activity , and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;

&quot; each special note is used to finance a clear and fast @-@ pay@@ able development program or superior ( including a se@@ ct@@ al development program or not , according to the procedures and practices , which is approved for the use of the organization financed by the organization financed by the organization of the Organisation ( including letter b ) of the presi@@ ding in addition to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special shareholders may not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization , which have been approved as part of loan or loans for a program or plan , which had already been approved by direct directors of the Bank or organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special loans , the same amount of payment , which apply to the organization granted development in general , are generally non @-@ refundable in ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special items are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this blo@@ c are directly to the organization that ret@@ ains them .
&quot; each special note is characterized by a separate loan agreements between the receiving land and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is specified . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from any special note may be used for expend@@ itu@@ res in the currency of the lobby , or for goods or services , respectively . ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and according to the allocation of what the administrator can be given at the time of loan granted . &quot;
&quot; capital returns to the special shareholders in the currency of a member account , and the amount paid to this way in the currency of a member amount paid as soon as possible from the administrator to the concerned member state . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker teaches up to the complete submission of all special information on the EEC , which are currently approved by directors and programmes relating to the directors and programs . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the payout of special occasions , the administrator instructed the EEC to quarterly on the development of the special note and the required expenses . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , an exhau@@ sti@@ al statement of the organization with an opinion on the external audit@@ or of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; following a full payment of the special note , the administrator of the EEC is transmitted as soon as possible a detailed report on the accounts financed by the special shareholders &quot; project and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ akers are created and performs appropriate records and calcul@@ ates , from which the contributions on the special shareholders , which are paid out of the account and from the account paid accounts and payments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers are working close to the targets of this agreement closely together .

&quot; in the form of a letter , between the European Economic Community and the Argentin@@ ean Republic about trading with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb &quot;
&quot; I ad@@ ore me , in the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to the establishment of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goats from Argentina into the European Economic Community related to the application of the common market organisation for sheep and sheep by the community . during this negotiations the two parties have agreed as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or frozen h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goats &apos; ( 02.@@ 01 A IV ) ; &quot;
&quot; within the framework of this agreement , the distribution options for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goats from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in Battlefield weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a perfect functioning of the agreement , Argentina decided to ensure that fact , the amount of the yearly volume is not exceed , and is carried out in accordance with the conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other prior to the implementation of such a change in the number 10 above mentioned in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes responsibility for the protection of protection , it comm@@ its to concern the concern that this agreement is not affected by Argentina &apos;s agreement to the community market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports came from Argentina in one year , the community reserves the right to expos@@ e the involvement from Argentina to the rest of the year . &quot;
the community is committed to import exhau@@ st@@ ion on imports of this agreement on imports of 10 v.@@ H . AD val@@ o@@ rem to limit .
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community changes in consultation with Argentina , set under number 2 , according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with every new member state . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , the sub@@ missions are determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; the calculation is applied to the value added under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; under number 2 , the total volume of accession to the community is set to 23 000 tons of slaughter weight . &quot;
the community will under@@ take everything to avoid market development which could significantly affect the marketing of Argentin@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ers in the joint market within the agreed amount .
&quot; in particular , the commun@@ ion meets the community arrangements , thus the ship@@ ments of inter@@ vention@@ marks on frozen meat due to the implementation of the Regulation of Argentine H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ ers are not under@@ mining . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and determin@@ ations of this agreement , the community is agreed that every actual application of exhau@@ sts or other funding measures for the export of sheep and lambs , are only in accordance with the existing international obligations and the traditional share of the community at the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for Design and Application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina guarantees the adher@@ ence of this agreement in particular that the quantities may be issued within the agreement specified in this agreement on number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to meet all necessary precau@@ tions to meet all necessary precau@@ tions for the above @-@ mentioned products containing origin in Argentina , based on presentation of a compensation license which is designated by the Argentin@@ ean government . &quot;
&quot; the details for the application of this system will be defined , that on the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence may be ren@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; in implementation regulations , in addition , the competent authority of the community has been granted to the relevant community at regular intervals , which have been issued in regular intervals for the distribution license ; these details are de@@ cryp@@ ted according to determin@@ ants . &quot;
the exhaust is worried that the agreement must be applied and smoothly works .
&quot; it regularly checks the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat market of both parties and on the global market and the conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the shooting is worried that the proper use of this agreement will not be imp@@ aired , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats are not stated under the agreement under the agreement under the agreement . &quot;
the shooting took all the questions when carrying out this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be und@@ am@@ aged by the rights and comm@@ it@@ ments of the parties in the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the rate set under number 2 applies to the period from January 1 to January 31 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the amount of resulting from the entry into force to 1 January of the following year is set in proportion to the total annual volume , and carries the seasonal character of trade . &quot;

&quot; I ad@@ mits to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to the definition of provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goats from New Zealand into the community with the application of Regulation on a joint market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and pul@@ p after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand @-@ based H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ ers must not be imp@@ aired , I ad@@ ore myself to propose the following agreements : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or frozen h@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goats &apos; ( 02.@@ 01 A IV ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is provided for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat for access to the market of the community in which the treaty was established . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand receives the assurance , that the normal sales of his h@@ amm@@ el - and bra@@ i@@ dy did not be dra@@ gged by the application of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a perfect functioning of the agreement , New Zealand required to ensure that fact , the quantity of this quantity could not exceed the quantity . &quot;
the specified quantities are executed in common offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
&quot; the community assured that New Zealand should not be hin@@ dered with this agreement to use new technological developments , or its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contra@@ ctual parties will consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned out to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes refuge in the protection of protection , it comm@@ its to protect themselves from this agreement with New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports of New Zealand exceeded the agreed amount , the community reserves the right to expos@@ e the imports out of that country . &quot;
the community is committed to import exhau@@ st@@ ion on imports of these agreements on imports of 10 v.@@ H . AD val@@ o@@ rem to limit .
&quot; at the accession of new Member States , the community changes in consultation with New Zealand that set up 2 fixed quantities in accordance with the scope of New Zealand trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ fusion loads of these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession , which is applied to clause 5 in clause 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is set in clause 2 , with the day of accession to the Community to 245 500 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
the community will under@@ take everything to avoid a market development which could affect the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ b@@ atic on the common market within the agreed amount .
&quot; in particular , the commun@@ ion meets the community &apos;s anticip@@ ation , thus the ship@@ ments of inter@@ vention@@ marks on frozen meat due to the implementation of this objective does not under@@ mining this goal . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contra@@ ctors to promote the fuel consumption in the community without danger to promote market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the goals and determin@@ ations of this agreement , the community is agreed that every actual application of exhau@@ sts or other funding measures for the export of sheep and lambs , are only in accordance with the existing international obligations and the traditional share of the community at the world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures that in clause 2 , compliance with clause 2 are assured in particular that there is no exc@@ use of these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to meet all necessary precau@@ tions to meet all necessary precau@@ tions for the above @-@ mentioned products containing origin in New Zealand , which is designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
&quot; the details for the application of this system will be defined , that on the position of a security deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence may be ren@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; in implementation regulations , in addition , the competent authority of the community has been issued , the competent authority of the community has been granted to the community at regular intervals ; these data are estimated to de@@ cryp@@ t the identification country . &quot;
&quot; the shooting is worried that the agreement is applied , and will work smoothly . &quot;
&quot; the ex@@ ams regularly checks the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat market of the two contra@@ ctors and on the global market and the conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the shooting is worried that the proper application of the agreement will not be imp@@ aired , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goats are not mentioned under the agreement in the agreement after the community . &quot;
&quot; all the questions submitted to the agreement of the agreement , which will be submitted by a party party , recommends appropriate solutions to the relevant authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply to the rights and obligations of the contra@@ ctual parties under the G@@ AT@@ T contract .
&quot; the set of set in clause 2 applies to the period from January 1 to December 31 , which will come to the 1 January of this agreement to the 1 . January of the following year , the amount is set to increase in proportion to the total volume of the year . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the basis of this agreement as well as for the major New Zealand area on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; this agreement occurs on 20 October 1980 in force . it is valid until March 31 , 1984 . after that date , it remains in force , subject to any contract , with a period of one year before the 1 . April 1984 , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by two contra@@ ctual parties prior to 1 April 1984 . &quot;

&quot; container and in@@ fusion devices are provided in front of the label with one in English and French , according to the contents contained in the plants 2 to 10 this protocol . &quot;
human whole blood can only be shipped in containers in which the temperature can be kept at 4 C @-@ 6 C throughout all tran@@ sports .
&quot; the samples mentioned in Part II of this protocol and devices have to be ster@@ ile , ap@@ y@@ betra@@ yed and po@@ ison@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the broad@@ casts required to in@@ fusion units , as well as solvents for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is taken into a healthy human being and with an appropriate anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant blood .
&quot; C ) non @-@ free from blood trans@@ fu@@ sions are transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; the blood vessel takes place as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is led by a closed , ster@@ ile pi@@ ping system in a ster@@ ile bottle , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ tural solution was observed in front of Ster@@ ili@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; after finishing the bleeding , the bottle is immediately closed and cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards it may be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; Men@@ gen@@ al may not exceed 220 ml per liter of human full blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation must not be subjected to 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is previously used in hand of the blood cells and of the server ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out through the investigation of blood cells in a new sample of the don@@ or .
&quot; as far as the blood @-@ group determination in individual countries are standardized or recommended procedure , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the term R@@ h @-@ negative is only to use when specific examination will be the in@@ sist@@ ence of the non @-@ existing subjects , D , D , and E . &quot;
&quot; due to this agreement , blood is intended to use only for the recipient of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group . &quot;
&quot; the human whole blood is stored in ster@@ ile , closed bottle from micro @-@ organisms to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transportation of necessary times , which should be able to cool in 4 to 6 C once again . &quot;
&quot; a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood , from which the biggest part of the plasma is removed . &quot;
it contains all red blood cells of the unit that have been won ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of concentrate consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial solution , which was added after the pl@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , thus the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit ) is used on the label . &quot;
&quot; all required processes must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the delivery must be made under use of ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; for example , an artificial water @-@ based solution has been added , so it &apos;s also given its volume and composition . &quot;
&quot; the human dried plasma is won by de@@ hydr@@ ation of the fluid , which de@@ compos@@ es into cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or se@@ di@@ fication of human whole blood . &quot;
&quot; the human dried plasma is extracted through cold drying or any other method , which is avoided by a den@@ ying of proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a water level , which corresponds to the liquid , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the so won solution should not be less than 45 g per liter , and the solution must not have visible signs of ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh milk sample ) a dangerous content of is@@ oh@@ em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune hem@@ at@@ glut@@ in@@ ine have been determined .
&quot; if the plasma is mixed and frozen within 48 hours after blood removal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in the plasma , blood don@@ ates , the signs of a bacterial infection has not been used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to decrease the risk of the transfer of is@@ ic@@ ular she@@ pher@@ itis , to decrease the plasma welding , which do not apply more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods , the most known masses are in a similar way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid rates , which was al@@ igned with the manufacture of plasma , corresponding water quantity is necessary ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quant@@ um plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which was produced , which is produced , the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) one sets 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of th@@ rom@@ bin or calcium chloride , so it takes place ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ step drying process in presence of phosph@@ orous pent@@ oxi@@ fication under a pressure of maximum 0,@@ 02 mm mercury must not occur in the human dried plasma weight loss above 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dried plasma is in a nitrogen atmosphere , or in the air empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle under exclusion of every micro@@ organisms and to the possibility of moisture ; it is to keep light and keep at a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
&quot; human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma @-@ rot@@ ein are preparation of the protein component , which consists of about 60 % of the total protein mass of the plasma &apos;s total protein . &quot;
&quot; without regard to whether the final product flu@@ ffy or dry , the preparation for an addition to an appropriate stabili@@ zer must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C in the final container for 10 hours to activate the path@@ ogen of the is@@ ic@@ ular she@@ pher@@ itis . &quot;
in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in need to be at least 95 % of the mass of the existing proteins .
in both preparations no more than 10 mg of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present .
&quot; if the final product is dried up , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the group is produced from human plasma proteins , the group must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human Alb@@ um@@ in is made as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 g per liter . &quot;
