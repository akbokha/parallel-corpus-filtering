the present document is a summary of the European Public App@@ endi@@ ary Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the studies referred to as the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as a injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. verteb@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness , a mental illness in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal spirit ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
&quot; the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems , if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to the injec@@ tions or the processed tablets in patients , which prepar@@ es the swal@@ low of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be min@@ ed , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
this imp@@ airs the signal data between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; which means chemical substances that allow communication to the nerve cells .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l probably affects as &quot; partial ag@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in lower degree than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter seems to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; because D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder are playing a role , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which causes psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , to prevent re @-@ occur symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of injection solution was compared with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases associated with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases associated with a placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent re @-@ occur in 160 patients with whom the man@@ ian symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tion@@ solution was compared with a study in 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which l@@ itt@@ eth in increased rest@@ less@@ ness , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment . &quot;
the company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution for adjust@@ ing ) .
&quot; in the two trials , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly higher reduction in symptoms increased significantly more than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo diagnosed with previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo perceived symptoms of distur@@ b@@ ance and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy to the intake ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ ct@@ oral disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , Nau@@ sea ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , Nau@@ sea ( severe sp@@ read@@ iness ) , nausea and exhau@@ st@@ ion , imp@@ ur@@ anium , in@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and of medium @-@ to @-@ severe episodes of patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , confron@@ ted the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar disorder , if an oral therapy is not appropriate against the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission awarded the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the acquisition of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a rate of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals .
&quot; an increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are clear ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder had no increased su@@ icides risk using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ ral diseases , conditions which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ xis dy@@ nasty . &quot;
&quot; if used with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients and symptoms of a late dy@@ nasty occur , should be moved to reduce the dose , or to break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has developed signs and symptoms designed to indicate a m@@ ns , or not a clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics must be removed , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in an@@ history or with states that are related to sei@@ zu@@ res , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l increased in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ wanted frag@@ ile events at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l patients were treated . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no exact risk estim@@ ations for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events at AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , which allow the direct delay . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti @-@ psych@@ otic effects , in which weight gain is observed , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , be careful when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other central @-@ effective medicines with over@@ lay side effects such as seals ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the result rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects have to be made . &quot;
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ ites compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other high @-@ effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the potential benefit should weigh potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be increased from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; di@@ lem@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be expected with a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the in@@ adequate data base for the safety of human beings and due to the recur@@ r@@ ative concerns of the animal , this medication may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , to use until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of more than 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , were treated with a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ ony and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esis ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled test study more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled study period of more than 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; during a long @-@ time period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , was no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ Ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic patients were observed in the patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and beyond their occurr@@ ence to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , toxic events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal def@@ ici@@ aries were observed in adult patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without a death sequence . &quot;
&quot; in fact , no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , however , is unlikely to have hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose of benefit , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is medi@@ ated with sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder on d@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor , and a moderate aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4- , ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 ad@@ ren@@ ches and to the Hist@@ amin @-@ H1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day , the Pos@@ it@@ ons @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ ages reduction of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 @-@ receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on Putin &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a half of the study controlled study , 52 of the proportion of patients who maintained a response to study medicine were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ r@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvements than in Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study destination &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced by at least 7 % above the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a reduced efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dose with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no superior effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a compared to placebo in week 3 and an maintenance effect that was comparable to that of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol per week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a similar proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which do not reflect on Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ Mon@@ otherapy during therapeutic ser@@ en@@ oid , showed a superior effectiveness in reducing serious symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in various patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar recovery , predominantly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average elim@@ ination of elim@@ ination for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is for extensive metabol@@ ites over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ op@@ ic analysis of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients were no gender dependent effects . &quot;
a population @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in respect to ethnic origin or the effect of the cat@@ er@@ esis on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with a varied liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not enough to pull the shots on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeat@@ able gift , reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ opy potential , the pre@@ operative data could not recognize special haz@@ ards for humans . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dose or exposure to humans , so they only have limited or no significance for clinical use . &quot;
the effects of the dos@@ ages of dos@@ ages ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ m@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was diagnosed as a result of the precipitation of sul@@ fate @-@ metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated orange @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) during the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose for people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human G@@ alle at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of concentrations , which were found in the study over 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11@@ fold in the middle Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a reduced efficacy against placebo over 3 weeks . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ ing disorders in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be completed and the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be started . &quot;
&quot; to increase res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under circulation of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicine used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no investigations into the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al troubles which caused differently than sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if an par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ ological injection can also be considered necessary for the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , the patient should be observed in regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see paragraph 4.5 ) . &quot;
research and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not prescribed for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , cardi@@ ac disease , over@@ flow disorders ) , cereb@@ ral diseases , conditions which are used for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;

&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ ometer , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ otic effects , in which weight gain is observed and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dan was larger compared with the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) and received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the result rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not considered clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;

&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , would have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be increased from AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular received , was the intensity of se@@ dan larger compared to the sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) as under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled study term more than 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % was under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; during a long @-@ time period of more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , was no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic patients were observed in the patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that can occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and beyond their occurr@@ ence to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ ic syndrome , toxic events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al problems was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution with statistically significant improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time trial ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms regarding the ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
the observed average improvement of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS excitement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar effectiveness in relation to the total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be determined due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in a half of the study controlled study , 52 of the proportion of patients who maintained a response to study medicine were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % . &quot;
&quot; current values from Mess@@ r@@ als , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions scale , showed a significantly stronger improvements than in Hal@@ op@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the decline rate , which was 34 % in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study destination &apos; weight gain &apos; was reduced by oral patients ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patient data sets ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study , involved in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which approximately three quarters had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
&quot; a total of 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 of Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; only the patients who have been treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there were no difference in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to deteri@@ oration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs . &quot;
it must also not be applied in patients that have low neut@@ rop@@ enia numbers in the blood before the start of the treatment .
&quot; the drug for human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was diagnosed with patients in which the first treatment was no more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs , and that unlike other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs , it must not be used to reduce side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission told the company Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted a approval for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neutr@@ rop@@ enia ( neut@@ rop@@ enia , &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or heavier sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy for the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; for sens@@ ory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , the treatment is subjected to interru@@ pt@@ ing the dose to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies in patients with imp@@ aired kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a Alb@@ um@@ in @-@ linked nan@@ op@@ ax@@ el @-@ shaped like other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be placed immediately and has a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again . &quot;
&quot; in the patients there should be no more Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles , until the neut@@ rop@@ enia is increased again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and increased the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ds to be increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a unique with Abra@@ x@@ ane was not proven in connection with the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac inci@@ dents in the inde@@ xed patient community are not unusual , especially in patients with former anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or the underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarr@@ hea , these may be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not practice pregnant or pregnant women in the bent age , which do not practice effective contra@@ c@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ easy . &quot;
women in bent age should apply during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable contra@@ c@@ eption method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , will stim@@ ulate , while and up to six months after the treatment no child testify . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised prior to treatment via a sperm account , since the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible un@@ fruitful . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects as fatigue ( very common ) and dizziness ( frequent ) that can affect the traffic noise and the ability to serve machines .
listed below are the most common and most important inci@@ dents of side effects that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III clinical trial every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) , and it was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of patients . &quot;
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy appeared in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ ing hydro@@ gen@@ ase in blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood disorders : &quot;

&quot; pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ drug , which promotes the cl@@ aw of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ ces and stabili@@ zed the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of her dep@@ oly@@ mers . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organisation of the micro@@ rot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network , which is essential for the vital interest and mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is convey@@ ing the Trans@@ cy@@ t@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ st@@ as in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies it has been demonstrated that the present time of alb@@ um@@ in to transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this enhanced trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transportation is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ Alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and due to the common protein SP@@ ARC ( cream protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors .
&quot; the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two @-@ part un@@ blind trials and 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane containing Abra@@ x@@ ane containing a dose of 175 mg / m2 with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi @-@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solv@@ ent containing allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as 30 minute in@@ fusion without preced@@ ent ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; when taking into the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse effects ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ est@@ amps . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of met@@ ast@@ as@@ cation and 19 % due to met@@ ast@@ as@@ cation and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 . the results for the general response rate and time to progression free survival and progression free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy , are below . &quot;
&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , was evaluated by a degree for patients receiving a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 during the therapy . &quot;
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy for dismant@@ ling to bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated .
&quot; the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials . &quot;
the drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 According to intraven@@ ous gift , Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 took the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration on multi @-@ phase way . &quot;
the middle distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or turn@@ out connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic features of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane is compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after Abra@@ x@@ ane Gabe higher ( 43 % ) than according to a solv@@ ent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injec@@ tor , and also the distribution volume was Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; published in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ lized in the first line to 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and the 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( 3 &quot; &quot; p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer was the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ rection by less than 1 % of the given total dose associated with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which has an extensive non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , beyond patients at the age of more than 75 years only few data are available , as only 3 patients of these age group participated in the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic analysis . &quot;
&quot; the chemical and physical stability was measured at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and light @-@ light light , protected by 8 hours . &quot;

&quot; member states must ensure that the auth@@ orization of the approval for the agreement will be provided prior to the market launch of medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores , with the following information and materials : &quot;
• School brochure • summary of the characteristics of the drug ( technical information ) labelling and packing line . • With unique image representation of the product &apos;s correct cooling boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that it is similar to a biological medicine that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and it contains the same active substance ( also called &quot; reference agent &quot; ) .
&quot; in patients with normal blood flow values , in cases of blood trans@@ fusion complications may occur if the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood @-@ loss of 900 to 1 800 m@@ l. can be expected . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be led under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that is indicated for the medicine .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected in a v@@ ein . &quot;
the injection can also be made by the patient or of his car@@ et@@ akers if they have received appropriate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults and between 9,5 and 11 g / dl of children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are monitored in front of the treatment , to ensure that no iron deficiency exists , and ice @-@ energy supplements should be given during the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or thereby that the body does not affect the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in . &quot;
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reducing the effects of a blood @-@ loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was able to enable them to become the formation of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa .
se@@ at@@ amed was compared with injection as injection as injection of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients receiving an kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
&quot; all participating in this study had been in@@ jected with at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene , before they were treated either to se@@ at@@ amed or continue with E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings between the start of the study and the assessment period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company also contributed the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ ulated ab@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering from one of kidney problems caused an@@ a@@ emia , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings of patients who have been re@@ amed on degra@@ dation as in those patients who continue to maintain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continue to maintain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ats mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; se@@ at@@ amed as injection below the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; finally , the Committee on Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ at@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , the medicine was a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which her@@ b@@ amed up , will provide information for medical specialists in all Member States information , including information on the security of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission awarded the Company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG on approval for the transport of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ emia and reduction in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ign@@ an@@ lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who received chemotherapy as a result of the risk of cardiovascular status ( e.g. cardiovascular status , existing an@@ emia in the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#91; 6.2 - 8.1 m@@ mol / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient to demand a large blood @-@ volume rate ( 4 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for a reduction in foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion compensation is expected . &quot;
&quot; HB 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood @-@ loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml are applied , which can not participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ate program . &quot;
&quot; the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target lies between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with which the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration between 9,5 and 11 g / l ( 5.@@ 9 - 6,8 m@@ mol / l ) should be found . &quot;
&quot; depending on the age of age , gender and total disease may vary depending on age , gender and total disease . therefore , the assessment of individual clinical trials and disease resistance is necessary . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s to be avoided by more than 2 g / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings may occasionally be observed in patients or under the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ bin@@ ds exceeds more than 2 g / l ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings exceeds 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored tigh@@ tly , to ensure ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for control of an@@ emia , an@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low heat value ( &lt; 6 g / d@@ dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher education doses than patients , in which the initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; these clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low heat value ( &lt; 6,8 g / d@@ dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may require higher education doses than patients whose initial an@@ a@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 , 50 / kg three times a week via intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 , or kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms , depending on age , gender and total disease may vary depending on age , gender and total disease . therefore , the assessment of an individual clinical trial and disease resistance is necessary . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should be tried by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored tigh@@ tly , to ensure ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for control of an@@ tigen symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ dencies increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl of the initial value , the dose should be maintained by 150 , or kg times per week or 450 , or kg per week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds increase in &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sions of &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 , or kg times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 treatment weeks with 300 up / kg three times per week , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se was increased by ≥ 1 g / l ( ≥ 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sions by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl each week , the dose should be retained three times per week . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds value around &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ ten@@ dencies increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sions above the initial value , an address on ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken down . &quot;
&quot; patients with light an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre@@ fabri@@ cation of ≥ 4 blood con@@ serv@@ ings should be required , should be stim@@ ulated in a dose of 600 i.e. kg body weight twice a week for 3 weeks before the surgery . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution , as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood don@@ ate program will be started , so before the start of the se@@ at@@ amed therapy large iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 , or kg ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgery and on the day of the intervention ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa was supposed to be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 ( or kg ) on each of 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a F@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical cooking solution to rinse the hose and ensure an adequate injection of the drug . &quot;
patients treated under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ igmat@@ ism ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not be ill or another ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ rin@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep cl@@ amps ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ ak known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edi@@ cal intervention , the application of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine disease is con@@ tra @-@ indicated : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , vas@@ cular disease of the disease or cereb@@ ral disease ; in patients with a short @-@ true heart attack or cereb@@ ral heart attack . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in .
&quot; in patients with sudden cardi@@ ac loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings ( 1 - 2 g / l per month ) with increased requirements for non @-@ failure ( iron , fol@@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium acid or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be examined . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / Mik@@ rol@@ o , or &lt; 0.5 % ) , which are determined to be the anti @-@ ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine antibodies and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diag@@ nose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity of sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in patients with a risk of anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events have been observed when ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ating active ingredients ( ESA ) were given to a target concentration of more than 12 g / l ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ines if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration is increased to the control of an@@ tigen symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions necessary .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings should be approximately 1 g / l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically bor@@ on@@ ated cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or reservoir , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target should not be exceeded under section 4.2 recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target . &quot;
&quot; according to this knowledge , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
patients with cancer patients should be considered to assess the therapeutic efficiency of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine response ( patients who might have to be trans@@ acted ) .
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) , the dose must be adjusted to lower thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic an@@ emia between 10 g / d@@ dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the use of combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk reduction in participating patients that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , if possible , prior to the start of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and correspon@@ d@@ ingly treated . &quot;
&quot; patients who want to under@@ take an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they should have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ al and vas@@ cular disease , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ deposit value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events can pers@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve survival in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia , or decreases the risk of tumor fung@@ us . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target was rec@@ eded by 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,7 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa together with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
no evidence of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F are found in vitro @-@ investigations into tumor @-@ woven examinations or GM CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
&quot; about thro@@ mb@@ otic , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ cardi@@ ac in@@ eff@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys , also reported patients under Epo@@ et@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , so also patients under Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ovas@@ cul@@ ous events ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ inen .
the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ates to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications .

survival and tumor cells were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
there was no difference in the overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in patients and patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to various common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statistically significantly higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in patients and controls are satisfactory .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events with tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results were treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in in tumour patient who were treated with chemotherapy with the aim to transfer a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings under 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the revised data . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and an extended half @-@ life of approximately 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; according to sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they will be determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complications of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributable to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically revealed cor@@ on@@ ary her@@ ed@@ itary heart disease , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings will not exceed certain values . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings by treatment of blood pressure in adults with chronic kidney problems ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood @-@ coloured ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) and to minim@@ ize your se@@ at@@ amed dose to minim@@ ize the risk of blood drops ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ onic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. when you have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events , e.g. when you have already occurred in the past thro@@ mb@@ al vas@@ cular events ( e.g. deep Ven@@ ge@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;

&quot; if an older orthop@@ edi@@ c operation is im@@ min@@ ent , the treatment begins with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of the an@@ a@@ emia should be treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood cells are too high ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood drops after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines / apply or applied recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with se@@ at@@ amed , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests in order to measure blood levels of c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and women .
&quot; in patients with a high fra@@ c@@ tional risk ( bone break ) , including in patients who recently suffered a slightly trau@@ matic hip s@@ quar@@ ry like the bone ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changed the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by injection in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ pp@@ e@@ similar symptoms , joint pain , and headache . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors , experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ ometric , a part of the data material for Z@@ ometer is used to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the first study involved almost 8 000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of verteb@@ ra@@ e and th@@ ig@@ u@@ o@@ gens over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , which had suffered a rec@@ u@@ ation of the fra@@ cture over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) for six months . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme which de@@ compos@@ es ) in blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis products ) was reduced by 70 % compared to the patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of r@@ ft@@ fra@@ c@@ tures were reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hips , 9 % of patients suffering from A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under Placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion , and are less frequent with repeated in@@ fu@@ sions . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ or or one of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion unit and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( extinction of bone fabric ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is a recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the similar material for patients , in which the side effects of medicines will be explained and noted , when they should apply to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europ@@ harm a permit to the agreement of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The packages of contra@@ indications of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non @-@ smokers and healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms of serious adverse events • W@@ ann to medical or nour@@ ishing help . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ osis Treatment : post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • In men with an increased risk of fra@@ c@@ tures , including patients with a recently de@@ ceased low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the ke@@ epers ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors , experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long ro@@ asting period was observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient influ@@ x of calcium , according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 of the initial or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after applying A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended as limited clinical experiences for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination of older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data is missing on the imp@@ lications and efficacy . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) not only because of that patient population is limited to clinical experiences .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ critical an@@ emia is before the start of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the fast recording of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , including symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ cal@@ an@@ emia can usually develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; additionally , it is very advis@@ able to ensure a sufficient influ@@ x of calcium , according to patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; canc@@ ers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be weighed in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ onate and a dental examination with reasonable preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental handles , no data is available whether the interru@@ ption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in a pine area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treat@@ able doctor should be based on treatment of every patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced shortly after the application of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of the serious side @-@ related cases of pre @-@ hop@@ ed patients were increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , overall rigi@@ dity of pre@@ hop@@ el@@ ers between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al cell interfer@@ ing Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which express itself as a decrease in kidney function ( i.e. , an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured in front of the administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function was comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase of the serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values recorded below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , with 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient quantities of vitamin D and calcium in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a recently ad@@ mitt@@ ing hill fra@@ cture , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area , especially with cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the pine area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid , were treated . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of the reports rel@@ ates to patients with tooth extraction or other dental inclu@@ sions . &quot;
7 study enrolled 7@@ 7@@ 36 patients with oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in a pine area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with placebo treated with placebo .
&quot; in the event of an overdose , leading to a clinical @-@ relevant Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ an@@ emia can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was observed in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( BM@@ D ) for 3 consecutive years , or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ als ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing flu@@ o@@ deficiency . &quot;
effects on morph@@ omet@@ ric flu@@ o@@ gens A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly improved over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ rates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on the hips of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a lasting effects over three years , which resulted in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for boun@@ cing fra@@ c@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the bone density of bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rates , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 Incre@@ asing the bone density of lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the entire r@@ ump of 6.0 % , and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology For 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic line after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed a placebo in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo and preser@@ vation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone mar@@ gins ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) serum samples were determined in serum and beta @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and serum @-@ C Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum intervals during study period .
&quot; the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months , significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
&quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months , and was kept at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months . &quot;
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror was not measured by rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 by oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall trem@@ or was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on total hardness and sc@@ ents than any time points .
&quot; the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Treatment took over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , an increase of the BM@@ D by 5.4 % on the total distance and 4.3 % on the shr@@ ubs . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study were randomised , and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures were 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared with placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a related to the percentage change from Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once to the percentage change of lum@@ bar @-@ BM@@ D to 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was investigated in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone phosph@@ at@@ ase ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , according to 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper standard in the study ) . &quot;
11 . efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in comparison to taking 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparison studies .
&quot; after 6 months of combined results , a similar decrease of the pain strength and pain reli@@ eving was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified by the end of the six @-@ month main study as respon@@ ding to the therapy were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic announ@@ cements in 141 of patients with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients could be maintained with a mean duration of the follow up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level decreased quickly to &lt; 10 % of the highest value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; the fast @-@ phase elim@@ ination of the large circulation system with half @-@ value of ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a season of elim@@ ination of the elim@@ ination period of ½ g of 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) represent probably the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the injured dose can be found in urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h dose and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid concentration of 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration vs Time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced cle@@ aring by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme met@@ abo@@ lized - metabolic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not met@@ abo@@ lized by humans , and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related cle@@ aring of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and amounted to 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; from this results , a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function to down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance to up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the c@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid . &quot;
&quot; for heavy kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ene Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ ter@@ able intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C ) were administered by 6 times the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without an ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous use the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in rats introduced in 3 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 6@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure , which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human therapeutic exposure ( corresponding to AU@@ C , corresponding to AU@@ C , corresponding to AU@@ C , corresponding to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated use in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects on other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was a prolifer@@ ation of primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , a result which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ inflammatory effect of the substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , we observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity in doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) de@@ formations and such skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity was measured at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium mirror . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions prior to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid is a representative of a sub@@ strate class that is called Bis@@ phosph@@ osis , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in males and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood level of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen which are formed from Andro@@ s , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass that is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material will be ordered separately , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a seems to norm@@ alize the bone structure , thereby re@@ loc@@ ates a normal bone formation and gives strength to its bones . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or to under@@ take care of dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care personnel if you have taken other medicines / apply or applied recently / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicine , of which it is unknown to the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and beverages , you worry about that you should take enough liquid to apply in accordance with the treatment of your doctor and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that will be given to you by your doctor or nur@@ ses as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating profit of the ridge . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administered by your doctor or nur@@ ses as in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has been working for a long time , you may need a further dose for a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions , so that the calcium mirror in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can operate longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you require a new treatment . &quot;
when the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a missed S@@ ing to agree with your doctor or hospital in order to make a new appointment .
&quot; prior to termination of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you should consider the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a if you come true to your doctor &apos;s doctor and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and shi@@ vers , muscle , or joint pain , and headache , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently it is un@@ clear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; allergic reactions , including more rarely cases of respiratory problems , an@@ ode rash and angi@@ o@@ dies ( such as swelling in the face , tongue , or mou@@ ths ) was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nur@@ ses , if one of the side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not listed in this user information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a short @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to increase the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the operating supply of the ke@@ epers . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be adequ@@ ately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ u@@ ret@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of the fast recording of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic process can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; additionally it is very advis@@ able , in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient influ@@ x of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a short period of low @-@ trau@@ matic hat@@ s , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the packages ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is additionally applied to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients suffering from obesity ( body mass index - BMI ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or which are overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in over 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used as compared to a placebo as a supp@@ or@@ tive tool to setting the smoke . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the studies of the noise , however , no uniform results showed that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was hard to estimate on this field . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . ng The complete listing of the connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects may take side effects .
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who suffer from an existing depression or suffering from anti@@ depress@@ ants , as it can cause the risk of depression , and among other things , in a small minority of patients su@@ icides . &quot;
caution is offered with simultaneous use of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for use in H@@ IV@@ - infection ) , tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or cl@@ aw rom@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA in regard to weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight .
&quot; patients are applied to patients who require health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( provision of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance treatment for patients and doctors ) , and around the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and movement of obesity ( BMI of 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which are beyond one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years due to the lack of data to efficacy and certainty .
&quot; La depres@@ sive diseases or mood changes with de@@ pressed symptoms were reported in up to 10 % , su@@ icides are given up to 1 % of patients who received the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; GE and for depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be applied unless the benefit of the treatment in individual case weights the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients , which - beside the adi@@ pos@@ itas , have no noticeable risks , can occur depres@@ sive reactions . &quot;
&quot; members , or other nearby people , are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occur in such symptoms and get medical advice immediately when these symptoms arise . &quot;
• El@@ derly patients The efficacy and un@@ question@@ able of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been shown enough .
&quot; patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , etc . ) in less than 6 months were completed by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , is believed to have the simultaneous gift of pot@@ ent CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors made the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant &quot;
&quot; SS@@ E were overweight patients and patients with an obesity , and in addition to 3800 patients in other indications . &quot;
&quot; the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse adverse effects in placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients , which were treated for weight reduction and due to accompanying metabolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence of statistically significant was statistically significant ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for undes@@ irable effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng With the evaluation of side effects , the following Frequ@@ encies are basically laid : &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ant study , in which a limited number of persons taken up to 300 mg were given , only slight symptoms were observed . &quot;
patients had a BMI ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and one of the same hyper@@ tension and / or Dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % , was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR to the public the present document is a summary of the European Public App@@ endi@@ ary Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which is explained in the study by the Committee on Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) to obtain recommendations regarding the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( especially important patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) can be applied in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabe@@ tic medicine ) can be applied together with another drug medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; it can also be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which can not be satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or insulin can be retained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos Treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced to the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or insulin . &quot;
this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better toler@@ ated and the blood sugar level can be adjusted better by means of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy , in addition the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , concentration of a substance in blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) measured how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted to a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which leaves that blood glucose levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ ate to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study enrolled in the combination of acet@@ tos and insulin in 289 patients , patients who were in addition to insulin induced decreased reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used either in patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ l ( high ket@@ on@@ - acid - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission awarded the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited as a permit for the acquisition of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , ar@@ ched and bear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin @-@ type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient , and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ adequate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compati@@ bilities ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ me , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ me , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and a advanced of advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with elevated output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the norm range ) , or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range are increased , the liver enzyme is as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate to a rec@@ ir@@ onic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , upper arms , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dar@@ ker har@@ n , are the liver enzymes . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether the treatment of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued , should be conducted by the laboratory parameters of clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ing weight gain was detected , which can be extracted from fat deposits , and in some cases with a fluid re@@ ten@@ tion . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ ov@@ el@@ ution in therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ its by 3.6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and at a lower degree in patients under Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff and insulin ( relative reduction in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ um by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of elevated insulin sensitivity , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consists of an oral twin or triple combination therapy with a sulph@@ u@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or as a twin combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hypo@@ glyc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the launch of the introduction of Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , above an appearance or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ mm@@ ing mac@@ ular de@@ co@@ de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ de@@ ms a direct connection , but mis@@ appropri@@ ated doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular de@@ ma ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic statement should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages im@@ plac@@ able events regarding bone mar@@ riages of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient desires a pregnancy or occurs the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers can not be expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in order to increase the 3 times .
simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of breast reduction reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the f@@ iller growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( not alu@@ able ) . &quot;
they lead to a temporary change in the plane and the lens of lens products such as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ stie@@ ge joined the tri@@ ples of the standard range in addition to placebo , but more rarely than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease , incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under Placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w respectively . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , rarely over heart failure below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been reported , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ history . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of announ@@ cements from randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation groups . &quot;
&quot; in the more than a period of 3.5 years , questionna@@ ires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act on an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) , resulting in the animal model to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton cells . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases peripher@@ al Glu@@ cos@@ mos in the event of insulin resistance . &quot;
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy became more than two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the onset of therapy , blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) could be calculated by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared with 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate despite three @-@ month optim@@ isation phase with insulin delivery , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value increased by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to continue insulin ; a reduction in the insulin treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on showed a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ations compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small scale based on 18 weeks to type 2 diabe@@ tic .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , and a slight increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ d the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to Plac@@ ebo , there was no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the vig@@ il tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ ural tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , as well as the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption , as well as to the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption of the tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease were random@@ ized to groups over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy , either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral use , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ ily absorbed , with the top concentration of un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on plasma generally reaches 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
according to the oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the barrel ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the middle plasma @-@ elim@@ ination @-@ life of un@@ changed pist@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active metabolism is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of the oral cle@@ aring of the breast is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agree to repeat Plas@@ ma@@ volume enlargement with hem@@ at@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric cardi@@ ac trop@@ hy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , which reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent or increased the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the f@@ iller growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) was induced by hyper@@ ten@@ dencies of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) of ure@@ tic epi@@ thel@@ ial .
&quot; in a animal model of the family @-@ specific poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ Indi@@ ons led to an elevated frequency of col@@ ont@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , circular , flat and wear on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
the calculated Fra@@ ktur incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in another study on two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were studied . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves showed a statistically significant decrease in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the vig@@ il tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ ural tri@@ glyceri@@ de level , as well as on a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ glyceri@@ de absorption as well as to the bi@@ ograph@@ ical Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing in terms of their primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the whole trem@@ or , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial , stro@@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , place the results suggest that taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , circular , flat and wear on one side the markings &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages im@@ plac@@ able events regarding bone mar@@ riages of randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 400 patients who received compar@@ ative medi@@ ation showed a increased incidence of bone mar@@ riages in women . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1,0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the vig@@ il tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but improved in addition to tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , as well as to the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption , as well as to the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption of the tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; acet@@ ph@@ ane was found in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pan@@ cre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin is effective . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured after 12 weeks of concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror which suggests that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human@@ oid .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who require possibly sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may have to be adapted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can take effect on blood sugar ( the complete list is the packages to take part ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane affects the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of acet@@ one in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily , if a fast @-@ initi@@ ational effect would be desired with a longer persistent effect . &quot;
&quot; the injec@@ tions must be loaded under the skin for at least 6 seconds , to ensure that the entire dose has been in@@ jected . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood sugar is improved considerably by an intensive insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long @-@ phase insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in animal origin ) can do that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in patients , a dose adjustment is necessary , this can be necessary during the first dose or during the first weeks or months after conversion necessary . &quot;
&quot; some patients in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions were observed after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or less than in their previous insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; prior to travel that go beyond several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , since such travels , insulin and meals should be applied or taken to other times . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in the therapy , and his patients always requests to en@@ quiries about other drugs . &quot;

&quot; however , a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be progres@@ sively developing : • S@@ low hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugar @-@ containing foods . &quot;
diabe@@ tics should therefore always be treated with glucose , cookies , cookies or sugar @-@ containing fruit juice . • Heavy Hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia is treated with a in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose , which will be given intraven@@ ously through the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect will start within half an hour , the maximum amount of action is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the entire mode of action is up to 24 hours . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already shown signs of cryst@@ alline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or tox@@ icity ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary bladder can still be increased over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ites , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment of treatment , Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ cies may occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still require further medicines to prevention of gyp@@ sy . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not studied for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a different medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ stur@@ b@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ure@@ tic levels in blood was below 6 mg / dl on the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients who Aden@@ ur@@ ic posted a dose of 80 mg per day , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) patients who once daily had a level of 120 mg in the last three measurements in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and no one of the 134 patients under Placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular , in patients with heart failure in history , possibly an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary level in blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but this could also be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ stur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the nur@@ ses known or currently present , Gi@@ cht@@ no@@ ises and / or an Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum level can still be considered for 2 @-@ 4 weeks still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) , a dose increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / l can be considered a day . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney dys@@ functional disorders , the effectiveness and safety had not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ene Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents , when there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; with organ transplan@@ ts , there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease For patients with chronic heart disease or de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ aci@@ dic drugs , it may occur during the treatment in an acute Gi@@ cht@@ an@@ fall because of the lowering of the serum levels of ure@@ tic acid , can be mobi@@ lized in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. with mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ i Ny@@ han syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in rare cases are so far increasing that it comes to a deposits in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; liver disease During the Phase 3 clinical trials were observed , slight re@@ iter@@ acy of the liver function were observed with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended , before the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment and subsequently to perform a liver function test ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was not performed to Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line levels ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; subjects were associated with the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times a day , associated with a rise of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not in connection with a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without any other active ingredient is necessary .
&quot; in a study involving volunteers working 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a day , a medium 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which refers to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ enzyme to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ant@@ acids It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids , the magnesium hydro@@ xide , and aluminum hydro@@ xide , contains the absorption of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( about 1 hour ) , and caused a drop in the C@@ max by 32 % , but does not cause any significant change of AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not leave any side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at to the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful in taxes of a vehicle , operating machines , or in practice of dangerous activities , until they can be reas@@ onably evident that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the investig@@ ator reported cardiovascular events in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al Study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no significant correlation was observed with Feb@@ ost@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the nur@@ ses .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , which have been reported in the treatment groups and reported in all Feb@@ e@@ ost@@ at treatment groups , are listed below . &quot;
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies have been observed no serious skin strikes or heavy @-@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open term renewal studies In the open long @-@ term renewal studies were 906 patients up to 1 year , 322 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
during the long @-@ term renewal studies reported adverse events were similar to those reported in the phase 3 study ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following untreated events were reported in all Feb@@ os@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients who received February 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients ) , according to data . &quot;
the following untreated events were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 for these cans either or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , insom@@ nia , hyp@@ other@@ ness , consp@@ ic@@ iness , skin irrit@@ ation , rash , rash , Bur@@ gen@@ is , kidney disease , disease concentration in blood , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in number of white blood cells . &quot;
action mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of the Pur@@ in@@ metabolic rate and arises within the scope of the reaction cas@@ cade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is a real , non @-@ Pur@@ in @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ shirt , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study , as described below ) , which were performed with hyper@@ ur@@ ik@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in any study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x a day ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with an altern@@ at@@ in@@ ine value to study beginning of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority for the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg / l ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
&quot; with regard to the permanent lowering of the serum levels below 6 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority concerning the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment using the dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg . &quot;
&quot; patients with serum values ( 1.5 and ≤ 2,0 mg / d@@ dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were allocated for analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the lowering of the serum levels at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ l / l ) was observed in the physician attendance in week 2 and maintained continuously over the treatment .
&quot; 509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney dys@@ functions , the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney dys@@ functional restriction ( i.e. h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was achieved at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences in relation to the percentage response of the serum concentration of subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum @-@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study merged ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years data from the open extension study of the Phase 3 showed that the lasting lowering of the serum levels on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of gyp@@ sum cases , so that less than 3 % of patients were needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients do not require treatment against a tox@@ ic@@ ation ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction of gre@@ ed no@@ des , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of gre@@ ens up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and received patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at after administration is easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ ing proportional increase . &quot;
after taking of simple or multi@@ cou@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml .
&quot; however , no clinical significant change in the percentage decrease of the serum concentration was observed , except this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
&quot; distribution The measured ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at lies between 29 and 75 l , after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg . &quot;
&quot; the plasma cutting connection of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary bin@@ ation to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is reached over the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed mainly by CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ide is primarily produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ eters of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine as un@@ changing Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found in the chair as an un@@ changeable agenda ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at does not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7,5 g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m g / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;
12 liver canc@@ er.@@ c. after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ um @-@ classification classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication B ) liver canc@@ ers no significant compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes in regard to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger volunteers .
&quot; Kar@@ zin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , Nec@@ ess@@ ity of Fer@@ til@@ ity In male rats showed a statistically significant increase of ure@@ tic infl@@ aries ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ome and car@@ c@@ ome ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed group , found in about 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
&quot; as a result , these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ met@@ alli@@ zation and ur@@ inary composition and considered not relevant for clinical use . &quot;
it was noted that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on ferti@@ lization and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , which were about 4.@@ 3- , the therapeutic tox@@ icity , maternal tox@@ icity , entered into a lowering of the increase and a development delay in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; Ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions that were about 4.3 @-@ times and in supporting rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times of the therapeutic exposure , there was no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are frag@@ ile ) in women after men@@ opause , a risk of low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before food , drink or take other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient should not take place until after the first food intake of the day that should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also led a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to the increase of vitamin D refle@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which was reduced by AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) as for those who only accounted for Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also put data on the present , that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( digestive problems ) , ul@@ cer ( bladder disease ) , thrust abdom@@ en ( sti@@ ff@@ ing stomach ) and absor@@ bing canc@@ els . &quot;
&quot; in patients with local sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who can &apos;t stand upright or sit at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a approval for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or use of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , cal@@ ci@@ um and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day . &quot;
&quot; the following indications are exactly to follow , to reduce the risk of mal@@ ign@@ an@@ al irrit@@ ation and thus to reduce side effects ( see section 4.4 ) : &quot;
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be swallowed up after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patient should not cr@@ ush the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. p@@ ept@@ ical ul@@ cer , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , only be given to special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; eco @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ ids , were rarely reported in patients under the in@@ gest@@ ion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partly these severe and required hospitals ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore att@@ enti@@ vely to all the signs and symptoms , which should be pointed to possible reactions , and the patients are to be pointed out to prevent the medicine or retro@@ spec@@ ulation pain or a new or de@@ lim@@ mer pain or to prevent medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious adverse reactions seems to be increased in patients , which should not be taken correctly and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ ign@@ ant irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dose instructions will be passed to patients and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large clinical trials with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( after market launch ) Mag@@ - and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw , usually related to a tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ omyel@@ itis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therap@@ eu@@ cation contains primarily intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the termination of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ ric therapy in patients who dimin@@ ished a j@@ aw surgery , reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the j@@ aw . &quot;
the clinical assessment through the treatment doctor is crucial for the treatment of treatment in any patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the patients should be instructed , taking them when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning , after they have noticed their sec@@ tion@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; they should not take two tablets a same day , but taking taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the planned weekly day . &quot;
other diseases resulting from mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated at the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ ons if they be taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials involving a variety of ordinary drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used during the pregnancy even of l@@ act@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not allow a note on the pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw was reported in patients under Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports date from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , the serum @-@ cal@@ ci@@ um took up to &lt; 8.0 mg / l ( 2.0 m@@ mol / l ) and the serum of phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2,0 mg / l ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mol / l ) in both treatment groups . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ follow an oral overdose can occur Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ op@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract such as gast@@ ric ex@@ iting , so@@ d@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , Gast@@ ritis or Ul@@ zer@@ a . &quot;

&quot; for the gift of radio@@ active vitamin D3 to healthy volunteers , the average ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine was 4 hours 2.4 % , in the barrel after 4 days 4.9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients with pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ ons , which is not stored in the bone , is eliminated quickly over the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is above , it is nonetheless reck@@ on that the ren@@ al elim@@ ination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ ons like in animal experiments must also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is given adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver transplan@@ t , to prevent damage of transplan@@ t organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ b@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company presented the results from previously performed studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study was presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application was compared with Ad@@ gra@@ pher / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ ts was gra@@ ded after a year after treatment duration of a year ( by example , for example , a new organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies of 119 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation were performed and examined as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;
&quot; Tre@@ ating ( trem@@ or ) , headache , nausea / vomiting , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and insom@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nie ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with lots of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro eyel@@ id antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components , Ad@@ vag@@ raf must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors have to be careful if others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the drug may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed yellow @-@ orange gel@@ atine capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow cap@@ sul@@ ated surface with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule holder with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only physicians , who are familiar with the immune supp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts , should be able to arrange this medicine or make changes in the immune @-@ intensive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or to an elevated incidence of side effects , including lower or over@@ immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot;
&quot; patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ b@@ us formulation and the respective daily dose ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ ined control of an experienced physician &apos;s transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a result of change@@ over to alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dos@@ ing adjustments must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us remains maintained . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of di@@ compres@@ sive and toler@@ ability in individual and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommend@@ ations
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level should be controlled from changing and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley @-@ level , was comparable to both kidney stones and case transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation at Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate re@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ aring , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ ance dose can last several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
if the patient &apos;s condition are not allowed in the first postoperative phase no oral medication intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentrate on the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be operated with a dose of ca .
&quot; duration of the application for the supp@@ ression of transplan@@ ts , the immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum period of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; other canned adjustment can be required later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us can change the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation of patients after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
dose recommendations - liver transplan@@ t proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have a gra@@ ft dose of pro@@ gra@@ pher capsules at a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , this change@@ over has to be done at a daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change of other immun@@ os@@ it@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ anza once daily has to start the treatment with the proph@@ yla@@ xis and liver transplan@@ tation recommended oral initi@@ ation for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ fts .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation After adult patients who are switched on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ ts are not a clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung cancer patients , pan@@ cre@@ as and present transplan@@ t patients in a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ ts in a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ ts in a oral initi@@ ation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dos@@ ing custom@@ iz@@ ations in special patient groups patient with reduced liver function in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function as a lowering of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function , the kidney function is no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als by T@@ acro@@ b@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of ren@@ al inspec@@ tions , a calculation of the creation content and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vag@@ raf in the change@@ over from a c@@ ic@@ los@@ ian @-@ based therapy is offered ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full blood the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of contamination and toler@@ ability in the individual failure of solid @-@ blood @-@ ton@@ ut@@ ri@@ us @-@ level inspec@@ tions .
it is recommended frequent controls of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level during the first two weeks after implant@@ ation . perio@@ dic@@ ally followed by peri@@ odic controls during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ valley levels of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also change as conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dos@@ ing custom@@ ization , changes of immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low cle@@ aring , the adjustment of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the valley levels must not exceed 20 ng / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the valley level of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us usually lie in the whole time to liver transplan@@ t@@ ations in the first time to liver transplan@@ t@@ ations in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with col@@ ou@@ ghing patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent awakening therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including transplan@@ ts , or other side effects , which may occur in succession by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Lower or over@@ exposure . &quot;
&quot; patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ b@@ us formulation and the respective daily dose ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ ined control of an experienced medical field ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 5 For treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft reactions , which were proved to other immun@@ os@@ it@@ si@@ va as refra@@ ct@@ ory data , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ inal formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ ts in adult cardi@@ ac patients and transplan@@ ts in childhood are not yet clinical data for the ret@@ inal formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; because of possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a lowering of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us levels in blood and an increase in the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) is contained , or other plant @-@ enh@@ ancing during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of t@@ acro@@ cent@@ ric concentrations in blood is offered since the T@@ acro@@ b@@ us blood level can be subjected to significant fluctu@@ ations in these circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was described as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hy , which can therefore occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors affecting the risk of such clin@@ ical disorders , are already existing heart suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function , infections , fluid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ os@@ mos@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes through suitable clothing or use of a solar protection factor with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take T@@ acro@@ b@@ us symptoms , symptoms for pre@@ s such as headache , changes of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf hard capsules , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose is included in patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ f@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or vegetable heal@@ ers , known as a inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , and therefore lower the blood values of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us or lower . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism , and provide the t@@ acro@@ cent@@ us dose to maintain the same concentrations as correspon@@ d@@ ingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly pronounced interaction has been developed with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and pre@@ icon@@ az@@ ole and the ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tik@@ studies revealed that the increase in blood level is mainly due to the increased bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal combustion . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ quality pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as it is used for acute abor@@ tions , can increase concentration of t@@ acro@@ b@@ us in blood or lower . &quot;
&quot; the effect of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ b@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us with medicines that affect CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 have been met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ b@@ us , the cle@@ aring of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ ction can be reduced and therefore , the hormone exposure may be particularly careful in decisions on the recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us potentially reduce the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on , and its half @-@ value extend . &quot;
&quot; the results of a low number of investigations on transplan@@ t@@ ations provide no indication of evidence that under T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us compared to other immun@@ os@@ it@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of un@@ wanted events in terms of course and the outcome of the pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , there is a monitoring of new@@ bor@@ ns to event@@ ual adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us ( especially in terms of its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the risk of a premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ b@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 out of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the secondary @-@ effective profile of Immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va can often be found precisely because of the patient &apos;s heart disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below , the effects of side effects are listed below their frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( = ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( frequency on the available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecule , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and plasma proteins can be assumed that T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
action mechanism and the dynamic effects on molecular level should be convey@@ ed by the effects of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) that is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection between the cells .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um dependent inhibit@@ ory of sign@@ age due to the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular series of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; in total , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies in these published studies in the major studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f in liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were applied to primary immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression . &quot;
L@@ itu@@ res transplan@@ t in an interim analysis of a recent study was reported in an analysis of more than 110 patients who received either T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of 1 : 1 @-@ Rand@@ om@@ ization .
&quot; in the first year after gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation , bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated to observe less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) in the first year after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the acro@@ economic growth rate of 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who have been changed to C@@ ic@@ los@@ us ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;

&quot; in one study , the prevalence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis was obl@@ iter@@ ated in one study associated with T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us patients . &quot;
Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation A multi @-@ cent@@ ric study involving human pro@@ gra@@ f was subjected to 205 patients receiving a pan@@ cre@@ - and kidney transplan@@ tation following a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initi@@ ation dose ( by protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and thereafter was reached after reaching the targeted Tal@@ ents from 8 to 15 ng / ml .
&quot; intestinal transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ ative immun@@ os@@ cop@@ ic study according to intestinal transplan@@ ts showed in 155 patients ( 65 only intestinal , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under T@@ acro@@ b@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for the screening of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mark@@ er ac@@ o@@ ists , lower initial doses of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , lead to tal@@ es ranging between 10 and 15 ng / ml , and the latest transplan@@ ting radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as low hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit@@ es and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ found faction of T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us , or by treatment with K@@ orti@@ ko@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for transplan@@ tation in higher cle@@ aring rates . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible that T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us is almost completely met@@ abo@@ lized - in particular , the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly takes place . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients receiving pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) at the ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ b@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was lower than at Pro@@ gra@@ pher . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ances is used for treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a deficiency of factor VIII , con@@ genital blood cl@@ auses ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application should be applied to whether adv@@ ances in treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention is applied .
&quot; patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffers from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ash problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles , or inner organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method which is known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA &quot; technology : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was able to carry it to the formation of the human Ger@@ inner factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ances is similar in the European Union &apos;s approved drug called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is otherwise manufactured , so that the medicine contains no proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by prevention of bleeding and surgical intervention . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 % of blood cl@@ as@@ ions have been awarded with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ances ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against human tann@@ ins VIII , Maus@@ er or Ham@@ ster@@ protein , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted B@@ ax@@ ter AG a permit to Adv@@ ance Adv@@ ant@@ ment of Adv@@ ant@@ ages throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , after the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; for the following sh@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity in the corresponding period is not below the specified plasma level ( in % of the standard or in the number / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patient is over .
&quot; during treatment , it is stim@@ ulated to control the dose and frequency of injec@@ tions , a reasonable determination of factor VIII plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis for patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be used doses between 20 and 40 % of factor VIII per kilogram of body weight by 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the anticipated factor VIII @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ are not be achieved if the blood pressure is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to detect an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
the administration rate is to be set after finding the patient with maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing Anti@@ bodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complications of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A treatment .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; developing the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk is dependent on the largest and genetic and other factors within the first 20 ex@@ position days . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) , with more than 100 extru@@ st@@ ages and well @-@ known inhibit@@ ors , was observed after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the re@@ occur of ( low @-@ quality ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences yet with factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , who are all diagnosed with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data cannot be estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the patients ( 234 ) calculations ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in one patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ots was calculated during all the time and the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15 @-@ operative day .

&quot; in addition , no one of the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) was observed in previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or . &quot;
previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII .
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contam@@ inated protein has been analysed by the investigation of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend than also a persistent peak of anti @-@ Ch@@ o cell protein , otherwise , however , no signs or symptoms , which had an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;

&quot; for Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study involving a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer in the area of the sub @-@ building , in the bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP has examined the answers to the questions submitted to him , still some questions were un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP has submitted a list of questions that will be sent to the Company . &quot;
the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Tum@@ ors will bring benefits to patients .
the committee had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not been sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be made in a reliable way , and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , is harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company didn &apos;t know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials , or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered effect of effect &quot; means that the pills are so @-@ called , that one of the effective components are immediately released and the other then released over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s treatment is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever , caused by an allergy against p@@ ollen ) in patients with nose s@@ mu@@ g@@ inal swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; adults and teenagers over 12 years old the recommended dose of aer@@ op@@ aze twice a tablet twice daily , which should be taken with a glass of water or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be re@@ produced on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main effective measurements were the changes in the loc@@ ating of the loc@@ u@@ pf@@ l symptoms , which were reported in the patient &apos;s treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; on observation of all loc@@ u@@ pf@@ l symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients who came to aer@@ op@@ aze over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ aze showed a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who lost Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , phar@@ yn@@ g@@ itis , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ n@@ osis ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or lau@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for treating aller@@ gies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ aze may also be applied to patients who suffer from a bott@@ om@@ ial glaucoma ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ activity ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) or already a h@@ ul@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke ( hyper@@ tension ) or even a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to the company SP Europe a approval for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , in the whole is to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cut , break or che@@ w ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the application period is as short as possible , and should not be continued according to the symptoms of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as with long @-@ term application the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin can take time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease of swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , treatment with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be continued as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients with mon@@ o@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , respectively , within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity with combined application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ aders like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , Per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ ide , cel@@ erg@@ oline , Er@@ got@@ amine , erg@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a , phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ cured , ep@@ he@@ drin , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient collective and the data are not enough to arrange appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not enough to address appropriate recommendations to the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the patients must be informed about the treatment of hyper@@ tension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ ss , or of pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( like head@@ aches or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the following patient groups the patient is given to be careful : • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension • patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in An@@ am@@ nese , diabetes mell@@ itus , blasphem@@ es or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ els in an@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since Anti@@ hist@@ amine should otherwise reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or to reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , there were no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ory tests could not be found any significant differences between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or taken with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited nor a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ consistency of the application of aer@@ op@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to normal population . &quot;
since reproductive studies in animals are not always transmitted to humans and on the basis of vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ctor properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it can come to a ben@@ drow@@ sin@@ ess , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic , or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S @-@ depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , Tre@@ aties , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , sc@@ ams of mic@@ rot@@ ations , muscle weakness , muscle strain , wa@@ xy , nausea , nausea , severe pain , dizziness , T@@ innitus , At@@ ax@@ ie , visual dysfunction and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children , as well as atrop@@ ine typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ ness , pup@@ il rigid and di@@ lem@@ at@@ ation , skin console , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human Mast@@ oc@@ ieties / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ug@@ sion P sel@@ ective sel@@ ective end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended clinical studies , 5 m@@ g. a day has no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage may cause more sympath@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , whereby 4@@ 14 patients received a@@ in@@ aze tablets . &quot;
in both studies the hist@@ amin@@ ant efficacy of aer@@ op@@ aze tablets determined by the overall code for symptoms ( except Nas@@ en@@ cir@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ) significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ op@@ aze tablets in regard to the swelling effect , determined by the Nas@@ en@@ s@@ mu@@ g@@ inal swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin , patients showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days the flow weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of an pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tical multi @-@ dos@@ cop@@ ic study , which was performed with formulation of healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were po@@ ison@@ ous . &quot;
one component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was associated with the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity with repeat@@ able gift , for Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , however , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may recognize no special dangers for humans . &quot;
the combination had no greater tox@@ icity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredients P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
in reproductive @-@ sto@@ ic studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and at rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2,5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children ages one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which are in shape of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children ages 6 to 11 , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients , which also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body is sy@@ rup , the solution to remove and the processed tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children are un@@ question@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptoms ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
in the two trials in Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted auth@@ orization to the company SP Europe a permit for the acquisition of A@@ eri@@ us to the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; there are limited experience from clinical trials for the efficacy of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be terminated accordingly to the previous disease and may be terminated in accordance with the symptoms of symptoms and re @-@ occur at their re @-@ occur .
&quot; during persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( the appearance of symptoms on 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) the patient can be recommended . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected during clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets not detected during which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ tox@@ icity and alcohol has not been intensi@@ fied by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ drow@@ sin@@ ess , which may lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic , or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more effects in patients with as@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events , which was reported more frequently than with placebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common side effect head@@ aches , which had been treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and with 6.9 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multiple dose study , which were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human Mast@@ oc@@ ieties / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ug@@ sion P sel@@ ective sel@@ f@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multi@@ ples , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flies . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in preventing the symptoms such as ni@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness , and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent Rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week , or less than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; as using the total co@@ res of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduced the burden of allergic rhin@@ itis caused by seasonal rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was examined as representing other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is considered to be the underlying path@@ ology in different forms and chronic patients can be recruited . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may also be able to improve the symptoms of the world &apos;s chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ anium . this is also confirmed in other forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ anium , the minority of patients who did not re@@ acted to Anti@@ hist@@ amine , were excluded from the study . &quot;
improvement of the youth spread of more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with ast@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleeping and of the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which was comparable to patients @-@ dem@@ entia with the general seasonal rhin@@ itis -@@ population , a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was achieved in 4 % of the patients . &quot;
there are no symptoms for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be completely excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in@@ hib@@ its in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 isn &apos;t in@@ hib@@ ited nor a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ study using Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) did not work on the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin performed pre @-@ clinical trials , with a comparable degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences in regard to the tox@@ icity fil@@ s of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and by Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity with repeat@@ able gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for reproduction metabolic data allow the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin no special dangers for humans . &quot;
&quot; coloured film ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indig@@ go@@ l 400 ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , slightly wax . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independently of meals , to relie@@ ve symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see below Section 4.4 ) , and that no data are prescribed that support treatment of a infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical investigations and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin fully functional and experienced a higher sub@@ strate load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of as@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which is fully met@@ abo@@ lized - is identical with the children that met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ osis and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients suffering from fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ Gal@@ act@@ ose @-@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ing or a suc@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected during clinical trials with as@@ eri@@ us tablets or detected in addition to those ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , intake of an@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not intensi@@ fied the most powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ erial Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies involving adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with as@@ eri@@ us , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , who were given up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years who came to question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine disease received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged 1 to 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the child &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of a clinical trial with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied for over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended dose of clinical studies , 5 m@@ g. daily for adults and adolescents had no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; during an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , alcohol caused neither to gain the risk of alcohol @-@ induced performance , nor an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us pills were effective in the lens of symptoms such as ni@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as using the total co@@ res of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us pills are effectively eman@@ ated by seasonal aller@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ian ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic parameters were observed in an pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are restricted to met@@ abo@@ lized . &quot;
&quot; the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no symptoms for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with the recommended dos@@ ages comparable to those of adults , who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is not yet identified , so inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;

overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between the ages of 6 and 23 months the most common adverse events were reported to be more common than placebo , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution were observed in an additional study of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution for intake side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years . &quot;
&quot; at the recommended doses , plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see below section 5.2 ) were comparable to children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) to prevent A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov committee on the prevention of viol@@ inist H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used for adults and older people to protect influenza , which is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of influenza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a tribe of influenza , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out if a new tribe of the Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus appears , which can easily spread themselves from man because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the immune system contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is able to form a fast antibody in contact with an influenza virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus , with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , det@@ ects the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for the evaluation of the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA to the pre@@ side vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; for more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which are infected with the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , as@@ par@@ ase is available as a solution for adjust@@ ing , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not included . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic therapy should then be classified only if the doctor has studied , which has taken an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient previously , and the probability is assessed to talk to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken twice daily with 100 mg k@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ ap@@ ase is aimed at the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , A@@ generic reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in blood and holds it at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS cannot cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system , and therefore also hesitate to support the development of AIDS associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic was studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , studied in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; it was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors at low do@@ si@@ r Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicines in particular , compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
main indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ proven concentrations of HIV in blood ( viral load ) or change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under Placebo , but A@@ generic was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ generic A@@ re@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ us@@ last , but of the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ism , were only very few of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults who had been treated previously with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug increased the vir@@ us@@ load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , there came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of vir@@ us@@ load after four weeks than in the patients who continued their previous release inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events of A@@ generic ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , em@@ esis , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic may not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ el@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generic may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ vy ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are equally used as as@@ phy@@ ase , and are harmful to high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who are taking care of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) or a immune response ( symptoms of an infection which are caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; finally , the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ generic for use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for treating HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years were silent compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is generally taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefit of A@@ generic in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or did not have been detected . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic was originally approved for under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval for scientific reasons , only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited for approval of the transport of A@@ generic in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , Prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ pr@@ ase capsules are to be administered at low doses of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of k@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r should take place in taking into consideration the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic Cap@@ sules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ itate capsules amounts to 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ itate capsules amounts to 20 mg of amp@@ ons / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ ons which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ap@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; u@@ pro@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ generic liver function should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use in patients with mild or moderate liver function should be treated with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; at@@ ase must not be used simultaneously with medicines that possess a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements containing the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ generic therapy does not prevent the risk of a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usually , as@@ par@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C suffer from anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy have an increased risk of severe liver disease with potentially fatal accidents .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specifications of this medicine . &quot;
patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic hepatitis cells show an increased frequency of liver function in a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; con@@ gest@@ ational application of as@@ ap@@ ase and c@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ist or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ tical co@@ ids , which is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment of systemic co@@ ster@@ oid leuk@@ o@@ i@@ der effects , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the epi@@ thel@@ ial function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the material change@@ over of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ine and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of increased risk of my@@ op@@ oly@@ sis , including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Organization ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , as@@ ap@@ ase may be less effective for reduced plasma ratio ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic inter@@ actions with amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive can be altered , however , the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given to amp@@ ons at the same time , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ et@@ root symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ yl@@ actic solution of the A@@ generic solution for children under an age of four years is contra@@ indicated and should be used with caution with certain patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be placed on duration 5 if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported over the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , or an ac@@ credit@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy drugs , associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B . higher ages , and with medication dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; for ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and ha@@ mar@@ thro@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; when HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immun@@ otherapy can develop a inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infections , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ factor ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immune supp@@ ression , higher Body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of A@@ generic therapy must not be used simultaneously with medicines that represent a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r must not be linked together with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe plasma levels with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , which can result in a vi@@ rolog@@ ical understanding and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in case attemp@@ ting to balance the lowest plasma levels by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , very often undes@@ irable effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of plant preparations with the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if one patient is already taking the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amp@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ onic mirror and , if possible , check the vir@@ us@@ load and continue the cur@@ b . &quot;
a dose adjustment for one of the medicine is not necessary if Nel@@ glo@@ avi@@ r is given together with amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r ( see also E@@ fav@@ ir@@ ence below ) .
&quot; in combination with amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) , it is reduced to C@@ max by 30 % ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of amp@@ ons were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove its effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % is hum@@ ili@@ ated if Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg / Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were administered at the combination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous use of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is not recommended as a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination , however , due to ant@@ acids the component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and as@@ par@@ ase is at least one hour apart . ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ ours in combination with amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would become low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin may possibly cuts the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r .
&quot; if this product should be used simultaneously , caution is offered since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtle plasma ratio . &quot;
&quot; if this medication should be applied together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be made , as an accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
simultaneous gift of amp@@ ut@@ ca@@ vi@@ r and Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in resulted in a rise in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus to an increase of Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in related side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in combined with car@@ ap@@ ase will be given at least half of the recommended dose , even though there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma ratio of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use twice daily , 700 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ max k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole on the 2.@@ 69@@ th compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ az@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; other medicines will be listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with as@@ ap@@ ase , possibly too inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; the patient should therefore be monitored in toxic reactions that are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with as@@ par@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids may not be taken at the same time as as@@ ap@@ ase , as it can come to res@@ or@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ uls@@ ants who are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a low plasma seal of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ otic pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ otic pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ otic pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ otic pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ otic pin and ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake of as@@ ap@@ ase can increase considerably by plasma concentration and rein@@ force P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ or , t@@ end@@ t problems and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , at the Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma ratio fell by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic co@@ operated with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ tical co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment of systemic co@@ ster@@ oids effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase shirts , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose material change@@ ability is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , increased sensitivity of as@@ par@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma @-@ pressure increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase shirts to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of this medicine is not recommended using amp@@ on@@ ca@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a common monitoring of therapeutic concentration up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ cent@@ us can be increased ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , as@@ ap@@ ase should not be applied together with oral in@@ sol@@ ete r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using ag@@ gregate r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al r@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors show a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given to amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r together with amp@@ ons , the patient should therefore be monitored at O@@ pi@@ at@@ et@@ root symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of its low reliability of historic sites , no recommendation can be given , such as amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; at the same administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive contra@@ cep@@ tive is not pre@@ dict@@ able , hence alternative methods to contra@@ c@@ eption recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after the benefit of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ able rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r lives in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction that was administered in the u@@ terus at the end of the drop in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during the stag@@ nation . &quot;
the further development of desc@@ endant including Fer@@ til@@ ity and reproductive ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r to the matern@@ ity .
&quot; in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications , the in@@ sist@@ ence of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; most of the effects related to A@@ generic therapy were light up to moderate , occurred early in and carried out rarely for treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are used in connection with gest@@ ion or any other at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the under@@ score of disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the below side effects were taken from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which NSC 631570 received 1200 mg of A@@ pr@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were used by the examination as in connection with the study media , and in more than 1 % of the patients were listed as well as under the treatment of re@@ active laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy was associated with HIV @-@ patients ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of strong and fa@@ xed fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ches ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated persons , which were treated with amp@@ ons in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( Sti@@ cking pack ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study at 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - treated patients under Am@@ ok@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is for a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin strikes were usually light up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ ker@@ at@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontan@@ e@@ ously within two weeks , without leaving the treatment with amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune response can develop a inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gl@@ ase twice a day together with low do@@ si@@ r Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Grade 3 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which received under the number of tri@@ glyceri@@ de treatment ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which received a@@ gener@@ ase along with low do@@ si@@ r Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very common . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if needed , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;

&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ el@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % protein concentrate ( IC@@ 50 ) from amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute cells , and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells &quot;

&quot; an gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 , showed resistance pattern which were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance testing analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used to assess the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ators .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 54@@ A / L / W / C , I@@ 54@@ A / L / C / C / F / G / F / G / C / G / G / C / G / G / C / G / G / C / G / G / G / G / G / C / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G / G /
&quot; conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations can be subject to additional data , and it is recommended to attract current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems to analyze the results of resistance tests . &quot;
based on ph@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing analysis of clinical vali@@ dated ph@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to assess the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or insul@@ ating isol@@ ates .
companies bringing diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phenom@@ enal cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV that can be applied to the interpretation of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic pattern produces a certain cru@@ iser against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ glo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ ca@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ al Resist@@ ant , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients with whom a Fos@@ amp@@ al @-@ hal@@ o@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ d ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
early depar@@ tures of failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ generic , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis set the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group compared to the time @-@ adjusted average change from the initial value ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , in a non @-@ sub gene wave of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials , with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; there was no low do@@ si@@ p@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the treated patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) , or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is . &quot;
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
19 Based on these data it should be considered to be considered to be considered to be considered an expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; axis .
&quot; after oral administration , the median duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increased , reduced to C@@ max by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered along with amp@@ ons ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r 12 hours to dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous intake increases the extent and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an und@@ eter@@ ised penetration of amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the plasma concentration in plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ led amp@@ ons , which remains the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ o@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of free active stock in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State concentrations of the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medication that are induc@@ ing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are given to be careful if they are given simultaneously with as@@ par@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice daily or 15 mg / kg times daily , leads to a similar daily ambul@@ ance exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than in capsules , therefore A@@ generic solution and A@@ pr@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ meter basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function should be low to elim@@ ination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schem@@ ata lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma tor@@ ches , comparable to those who are achieved in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ avi@@ r twice a day without con@@ current administration of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for se@@ gregation in mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne , o@@ cellular Aden@@ ome in doses of 2 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the orig@@ ination of mon@@ och@@ ial cells of Aden@@ ome and Kar@@ zin@@ ome was not resolved and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , out of the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little instructions for the assumption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes test , micro@@ core testing on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in clinical use of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase , this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected . &quot;
&quot; until now , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in clinical trials , neither during administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor by the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and amp@@ ons of patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of systemic plasma exposure that was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) as the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and slightly @-@ level skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses must be applied to as@@ par@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ itate capsules amounts to 20 mg of amp@@ ons / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of amp@@ ons which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous use in patients with weak or light liver function interference with caution , in patients with severe liver function , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause severe or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards Organization ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be placed on duration 27 , if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy has been associated with individual factors such as a higher age , and with medication dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , which can result in a vi@@ rolog@@ ical understanding and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in combination with amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) , it is reduced to C@@ max by 30 % ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min @-@ values of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were administered at the combination of Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing recommendation for simultaneous use of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is not recommended as a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and un@@ think@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fav@@ ours in combination with amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would become low .
&quot; if this medication should be applied together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring will be made , as an accurate forecast of the combination of am@@ it@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in combined with car@@ ap@@ ase will be given to a reduction of dos@@ ing of Ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ in at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , ni@@ b pin , and tox@@ icity of this drug may be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , at the Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily , together with 50 µg of Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma ratio fell by about 86 % ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ intervals 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; at the same administration of War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or rein@@ forcement of anti @-@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
con@@ current administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ ko@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may only be applied only after the benefit of the potential for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction that was administered in the u@@ terus at the end of the drop in the u@@ terus to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during the stag@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medications , the in@@ sist@@ ence of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is based on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) if needed , are necessary supporting measures . &quot;
&quot; an@@ tivir@@ al activity in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; the 50 % protein concentrate ( IC@@ 50 ) from amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µm at acute cells , and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 μ@@ g / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ mi@@ avi@@ d ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or isol@@ ates ; the receipt of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insulation . &quot;
&quot; based on this data , the therapy optim@@ isation of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered to be considered by the PI therapy . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ o@@ avi@@ r remained constant , the percentage of free active stock in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State concentrations of the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medication that are induc@@ ing CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ ing or in@@ hib@@ its or a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are given to be careful if they are given simultaneously with as@@ par@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the impact of a ren@@ al function should be low on the elim@@ ination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for se@@ gregation with amp@@ ou@@ tri@@ vi@@ on mice and rats compet@@ ed in male animals , o@@ cellular Aden@@ ome in doses of 2 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of amp@@ hor@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanism for the formation of the mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ ary aden@@ oms and Kar@@ zin@@ omes were not resolved , and the relev@@ ance of these observed effects for humans is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , out of the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials as well as from the therapeutic application , however , little instructions for the assumption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse mutation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ core testing on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al test included in human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity in young animals , which were treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and amp@@ ons of patients . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that the metabol@@ ites are not yet mature , so am@@ it@@ avi@@ r , or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic solution for inser@@ ting is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ ected inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;

&quot; the bio@@ availability of amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic Cap@@ sules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ grams per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the patient should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , taking the solution to the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ itate solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) amp@@ ons of body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of amp@@ ons which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there must be no dose recommended for simultaneous use of A@@ generic solution for adjust@@ ing and low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination of these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose adjustment for am@@ o@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for amp@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , an application of as@@ ap@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ l levels , A@@ generic solution is prescribed for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
con@@ current administration may result in a competent inhibit@@ ing of metabol@@ ised of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac arr@@ hyth@@ mia ( z .
patients should be pointed out that A@@ generic or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with A@@ re@@ ase , does not prevent risk of suffering from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Standards Organization ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic should be placed on duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy has been associated with individual factors such as higher , and with medication 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated with metabolic disorders . &quot;

based on the data of 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to significantly higher plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentration .
the potential risk of human beings is not known . A@@ generic solution for intake may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us on the contained propylene glyco@@ l ( see section 4.3 ) .

&quot; important information about certain other components of A@@ generic solution for adjust@@ ing the solution for inser@@ tion contains propylene glyco@@ l , which can result in high doses to side effects . &quot;
&quot; Prop@@ yl@@ glyco@@ l may cause a number of side effects including sei@@ z@@ ure , drow@@ sin@@ ess , heart sha@@ kes , and reduction of red blood cells ( see also A@@ generic may not be taken , special caution when taking A@@ generic is necessary precau@@ tions ) . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot the gest@@ ion of as@@ par@@ ase , if you have forgotten the gest@@ ion of as@@ par@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it , and then continue taking the intake as far . &quot;
&quot; headache , fatigue , diarr@@ hea , sickness , vomiting , t@@ aps of skin rash ( redness , bub@@ bles or it@@ ching ) - occasionally the skin rash can be heavy and you can force the in@@ gest@@ ion of this drug . &quot;
&quot; this may include grease loss on legs , arms and face , a fat increase in the stomach and in other inner organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fat burning in the neck ( &quot; Sti@@ cking pack &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other components are propylene glyco@@ l , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ( polyethylene glyco@@ l 400 ) , To@@ co@@ fer@@ sol@@ an ( TP@@ GS ) , acet@@ ine sodium , sodium chloride , artificial che@@ wing gum , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate @-@ Di@@ hydr@@ ate , gr@@ ated water . &quot;
&quot; the applic@@ ability and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the treatment of treatments : • For young bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , Al@@ dar@@ a is up to a maximum of 16 weeks . • For small bas@@ al ker@@ at@@ osis it is available for six weeks , while one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks break between the treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; in front of bed@@ time , the cream is applied to the affected skin areas , so that it remains enough for a long time ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with warm in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete elim@@ ination of treated War@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined at 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times a week .
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete elim@@ ination of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 505 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ es in all four main studies ranged from 15 % to 52 % of patients with Al@@ dar@@ a patients , but only 3 % to 80 % were treated with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % up to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ KS ) in the face or the number of les@@ ions have lim@@ esc@@ ence and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other top@@ ical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tu@@ es@@ days , Thurs@@ days and Saturdays in front of the bed and leave the skin for 6 to 10 hours . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long continued to continue until all visible strings in the genital area or peri@@ odic area disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks a treatment period . &quot;
&quot; an interru@@ ption above the treatment sequence should be weighed when intensive local inflammation will occur ( see section 4.4 ) , or if the treatment zone is observed . &quot;
&quot; if follow up to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions were only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient should use the cream as soon as he / she not@@ ices this and then proceed with the usual treatment tim@@ etable . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer , and into the st@@ oned , with gra@@ dients of infected skin , until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should be eff@@ ected between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of their auto@@ immune disease risk . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should be eff@@ ected between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and with a possible organ@@ ist or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction connected . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily basis auth@@ oriz@@ y@@ gi@@ ene has been carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is , and one case is observed with one of the circumcision . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed , which have been required for treatment and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions were seen at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulties with water , which made a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous formulation , for the treatment of extern@@ ally in@@ gen@@ esis in the genital and peri@@ odic range , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate to a increased rate of finger@@ prints at HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elim@@ ination of the incl@@ ines , however , a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma containing I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or hair removal was not studied . &quot;
local skin reactions are frequent but the intensity of these reactions take part in general during therapy or the reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream .
&quot; if due to the symptoms of the patient , or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treat of several days can be made . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be judged according to the treatment of treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
&quot; as there are currently no data about long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable therapy forms should be dra@@ gged along with super@@ fic@@ tional basic cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; patients with recur@@ rent and untreated B@@ CC@@ s are no clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has not been investigated for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ pants in the inside of the nose or the ears or at the lip@@ stick area within the lip@@ stick .
there are only very limited data about the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ic places outside the facial and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on acro@@ economic ker@@ at@@ osis on the lower arms and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take over the course of intensity or go after the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if local skin reactions to the patient may cause great un@@ eas@@ iness or very strong , the treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions have a lower complete healing rate referred to as patients with fewer than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied to treat patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not go direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , development or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither of the mal@@ icious application of the top@@ ical use of the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the feeding period . &quot;
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to adverse events in studies with three weeks of actual treatment were local reactions on the place of the treatment of gra@@ dients ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
&quot; the most commonly reported adverse events , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection @-@ related side effects include complaints at the application site with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; the Bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated in a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of phase III , are shown below . &quot;
&quot; the most common , probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context of adverse events were reaction to the application site ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) . &quot;
side effects that were given by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis are listed below .
&quot; according to the audit plan , the clinical evidence shows that in this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials containing I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream commonly found to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion / leaves ( 23 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the audit plan , the clinical evidence shows that in these trials with five times a weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very frequently to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe decrease and c@@ aller ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the treatment of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment center or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the vis@@ ually one @-@ time interval of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
the clin@@ ically severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after or@@ aler or intraven@@ ous fluid .
&quot; according to the top@@ ical use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were detected . &quot;
in 3 appro@@ pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies demonstrated that the effectiveness in relation to a complete evaluation of the incl@@ ines at an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; with 60 % of the total of 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated patients , the gra@@ dients were completely healed ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo in@@ treated patients of the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; a complete press release could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine male patients , compared with 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm . &quot;
&quot; the data from an open , controlled @-@ long @-@ term study shows that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically out@@ going , and it remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s effectiveness in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , invisible , discre@@ et@@ ly , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic acro@@ - les@@ ions in a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment area on the un@@ hair@@ less scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the recorded data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical trials after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of explanation , nu@@ ine ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fic@@ elles cell carcin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not on and were therefore not studied . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream was examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind studies of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
minimal systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentration in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0,2 and 1.6 ng / ml during use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 1 single bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ life period was about 10 times higher than the 2 hour half @-@ time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this has extended to an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the medicine in the skin .
&quot; the data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application of patients at the age of 6 - 12 was low , and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super @-@ target bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG was significantly reduced body weight and elevated sp@@ leen weight ; a study carried out four months , resulted in the mouse no similar effects . &quot;
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice was induced in mice by three days a week .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin , and is not mut@@ ated , a risk of people because of the systematic exposure is very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice , which was treated with the active free cream , previously and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms are as you . − When one of the side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( Cond@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itals of gen@@ itali@@ a ( sexual organs ) and An@@ us ( after ) have been a frequently found , slow growing form of skin cancer with very low probability of spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains un@@ treated , it can lead to dep@@ loy@@ ments , especially in the face - therefore it is essential and - treatment is important . &quot;
&quot; Akt@@ ì ker@@ at@@ pants are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people who were exposed to human exposure during their previous life . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only in the face and scal@@ p of patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment for you . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a cream supports your body &apos;s immune system with the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superf@@ icial basis of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , ac@@ tin@@ tic ker@@ at@@ osis or the responsible virus . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness ( by its effect in terms of reducing the G@@ ag concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver was investigated ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ ag concentration in the urine by about 60 % and half of the treated children were a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients at the age of over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , stomach pain , rash , arth@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , cal@@ ming pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion station . &quot;
&quot; frequent adverse events in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , dimin@@ ished oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ ar ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be applied to patients who may seem highly sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not to be applied . &quot;

&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients who receive alt@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in respect of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a approval for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ 4 , egg @-@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a mu@@ g@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ id@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) , to treat the non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient we@@ ars this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme may be recommended . &quot;
&quot; patients with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any additional side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of in@@ fusion ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should also continue to be eng@@ ined , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment , to re @-@ launch equipment for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies are formed against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , generally within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution in use of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , risk provisions must be c@@ auti@@ ous because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a interru@@ ption of treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the in@@ fusion of the in@@ fusion of medication ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) , to minim@@ ize the potential of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of light or medium @-@ to @-@ severe reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on half of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;

&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Pro@@ c@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data to new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ated over the breast milk on the breast milk , is recommended to do not breast@@ feeding while treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the adverse events in clinical trials were classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study were observed in 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) . &quot;
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the period of 5 years or older in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older at age of 5 ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs in history , severe reactions were also increased , including bron@@ chi@@ asmus , respiratory problems and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe exp@@ iry and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it came within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version , whereby it usually came to a ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version during the age of 5 ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early departure from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients were det@@ ectable with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ itors ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , including 3 patients , with whom it never came to ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with a lack of low @-@ body levels have a robust reduction in the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in Har@@ n during patients with high @-@ quality tit@@ ers a variable reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally to low neutral density effects on the enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions even when the occurr@@ ence of adverse events typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of accumulated sub@@ str@@ ates and preventing further accumulation of enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from the circulation and taken into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
although patients were recruited for the study which had been recruited for the entire disease spectrum was the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only a patient proved the severe phen@@ otype .
&quot; patients were recruited if they had been recruited exp@@ ir@@ atory volumes ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recruited for an open label extension study where they received additional 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients compared to placebo group improvement in lung function and the ability to be shown in the following table . &quot;
an open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as follows from the following table .
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage is not significantly higher than this period of clin@@ ically and absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased in proportional to body size growing .
&quot; of the 26 patients with an hepat@@ ocy@@ be of treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) had reached a normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear tr@@ ash of the g@@ ag @-@ mirror was found in Har@@ n ( µg / mg of Kre@@ at@@ inin ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients receiving a combination of a combined final FE@@ V , a range in 6 @-@ minute walk @-@ test , motion range of the shoulder blade ( AH@@ I and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally a improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted an open phase 2 study in which mainly the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients , which were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe decrease form and 4 ) . &quot;
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ AG@@ - Mir@@ a in Har@@ n during the last 26 weeks .
&quot; in several patients , a size of size ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean age @-@ in form , whereas in the older patients with severe degra@@ dation , only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into a dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata were carried out on the g@@ ag @-@ mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can be present in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , an adequate alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent to . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be any new information available , which are available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic profile of patients at the age of 5 was similar to those in older and less affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity in one @-@ time gift , tox@@ icity with repeat@@ able gift and reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data have no special dangers for humans . &quot;

notes for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentr@@ ates to produce an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h if the patient we@@ ars this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h is gradually increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS I@@ - Con@@ dition of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs in history , however , severe reactions have occurred , including bron@@ chi@@ asmus , respiratory problems and facial oils . &quot;
very frequent ( occurr@@ ence of more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • skin rash • joint pain , joint pain , pain in arms and legs • Incre@@ asing • High Temper@@ ature • Hyper@@ tension • Incre@@ ase oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion unit &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the packs will be updated . &quot;

preparation of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technology ) • J@@ e according to body weight of the individual patients first determine the number of dil@@ uted flow bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have no chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) , while the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant or metastatic ) non @-@ small &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not affect the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated in patients who have previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who had previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( a vitamin ) and receive injec@@ tions of vitamin B12 . &quot;
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to or after the gift of c@@ is@@ plat@@ in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines for vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
&quot; in patients whose blood was changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be applied , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of pel@@ em@@ bo@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
the conversion of pel@@ em@@ bo@@ xed in its active form is easier by static cells than in healthy cells which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer working time in cancer cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease before .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local or metastatic disease had previously been treated with chemotherapy alone , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , while both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in were over an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months at the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy had already received chemotherapy with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients whose cancer was not the record epi@@ thel@@ ial cells were diagnosed in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for the acquisition of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; each drinking bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml of 0.9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from flow @-@ bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see paragraph 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is used in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² CO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion the first day each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after preceding chemotherapy is the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as a day after the treatment , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose . &quot;
&quot; patients also have an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose , as well as every third install@@ ment cycle . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood image should be created in front of every gift , including a differentiation of leuk@@ ocy@@ tes and a thro@@ ro@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( WP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check @-@ check occurs among the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the predicted therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; according to recovery , the patient must be treated according to references in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient should get the value before treatment &quot;
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken down , if in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ reductions , a hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - on the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
clinical trials did not notice a note that in patients at the age of 65 years or higher compared to patients at the age of 65 is an increased by side @-@ risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data to infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance was required of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dos@@ ing adap@@ t@@ ations needed for all patients recommended dose adjustment . &quot;
&quot; the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( under 45 ml / min ) was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients with a liver function of more &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase levels of &gt; the 3,0 fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically investigated in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored in regard to the bone mar@@ l ression and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be administered to patients , before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ enia is reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ ten@@ ds have reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neut@@ rop@@ enia , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ sions and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as it were observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in degrees of 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , such as neutr@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutr@@ rop@@ enia was investigated if a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; as a result , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients must be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophecy for reduction of tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) , the simultaneous intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ ac@@ ic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients who are scheduled for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins must be avoided by taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients where these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage should be weighed in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ ral events have been reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed live vaccine ( except yellow fever , these vaccination is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly con@@ dens@@ ation of reproductive @-@ conduc@@ tivity caused by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins , men should be pointed out prior to treatment arms , advice regarding the sperm activation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1,3 g daily ) to a reduced pend@@ ul@@ um recur@@ ring effects . &quot;
therefore caution is offered when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after the therapy to be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data regarding the operation potential as with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the virus status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires a increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient du@@ cks with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ bo@@ xed for pregnant women , but as at an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected in an application in pregnancy severe birth@@ defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , and after careful consideration of the commercial for the mother and risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damage of reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ins , men should be pointed out before the treatment start to take advice regarding the sperm con@@ formity . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the breast milk and un@@ wanted effects during the nursing infant cannot be excluded .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity adverse effects , which were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ial i@@ om and were random@@ ized to random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 163 patients received a randomised C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as Mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ enter , randomised , simple @-@ blind phase 3 study of AL@@ IM@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a chemical and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in treated patients with a clin@@ ically significant advantage over those patients who were only used with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was undertaken in the population of all patients receiving treatment arms ( randomised and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement in clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
&quot; the differences between the two treatment arms resulted in an improvement of lung function parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm , and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in the check . &quot;
&quot; a multic@@ enter , randomised , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C were treated with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and of 7,9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

&quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BMI ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fet@@ ec@@ tom@@ ized nutrition . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i and after 12 weeks have no weight loss , should apply to their doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; if these enzymes are in@@ hib@@ ited , some fats can not shed some fats in the diet , resulting in about a quarter of the fats that are associated with the nutrition . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i , patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 could not be observed for the patient &apos;s relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movements , chair , fet@@ ish / o@@ ily chair , lowering of sparkling wine .

all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ critical or o@@ ily food diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be applied to children and young people under the age of 18 , because there is no sufficient data on the effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , or@@ list@@ at is only minimal , however , is necessary in the older and in patients with restricted liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • Equ@@ ational treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chronic Lyme disease • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Com@@ preh@@ ensive treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as ( see section 4.5 and 4.8 )
the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be imported with an improved metabolic control , patients who consult a drug against diabetes prior to the beginning of a therapy with all@@ i to consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dose of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an elevated cholesterol level , should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage must be adjusted to this medicine . &quot;
it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ation measures in order to prevent the failure of severe diarr@@ hea possible ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on inter@@ actions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma concentration .
&quot; when applying war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ as in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standar@@ dised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see paragraph 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta @-@ car@@ otene remained in the standard range . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended to take part before bed@@ time , to ensure a supplement of the Mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin@@ ant to ensure a sufficient vitality ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single @-@ one dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one was observed at a limited number of volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , a minor decrease in A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect dam@@ aging effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature , related to pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , as the absorption of single fat is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years , and were generally light and temporary . &quot;
&quot; the number of times are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of known side effects , which have been established after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at , is not known since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain size . &quot;
&quot; † It is pl@@ au@@ sible , that the treatment with all@@ i can result in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects . &quot;
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multi@@ ples of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days of normal and overweight patients without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the reported cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ trans@@ do@@ ings , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animal , the systemic effects of or@@ list@@ at can be derived from a quick re@@ formation of systemic effects , which are attributable to the li@@ pi@@ vot@@ able properties of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect is in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine co@@ sting the active serv@@ o rest of the gast@@ ric and pan@@ cre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ ers .
&quot; clinical studies were derived that 60 m@@ g. of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the food fet@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , randomised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 prove the effectiveness of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ critical , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of participants that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;

the weight reduction is used for weight reduction and is used in overweight adults aged 18 years with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
BMI helps you determine if you have a normal weight compared to your body size or overweight .
&quot; even if this disease doesn &apos;t first mean that you feel un@@ comfortable , you should still ask your doctor to ask for a inspection inspection . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight you can take advantage of a diet , you can lose an additional kilograms with the help of all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you are taking other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;

&quot; how to set up your cal@@ ori@@ ence and fet@@ ters , you can find out more helpful information on the blue sides in section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or a meal contains no fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in connection with a meal , which contains too much fat , risk @-@ related support ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , start in front of the first cap@@ s@@ ling with a cal@@ ori@@ - and fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; food items are effective , since you can always follow what you eat , how much you eat and it might probably fall easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to ensure your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • feed on gre@@ asy , to reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related support ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move out more before taking the capsules . &quot;
remember to ask your doctor in advance when you are not used to physical activity . • Stay during taking and after termination of all@@ i physically active .
&quot; • all@@ i must not be taken for longer than 6 months . • If you can find no reduction in your weight after twelve weeks of application , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ists by advice . &quot;
&quot; under circumstances , you will need to finish the intake of all@@ i . • In case of successful weight loss , it is not because in short @-@ term diet and then return to the old habits . &quot;

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not in this user information . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ side effects are combined with the mode of operation of capsules , and thus arise that the fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects occur usually within the first week after the treatment of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat content in the diet maybe not consistently reduced . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutrition @-@ related support : • Beg@@ ins a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a fet@@ ish@@ able diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite food and about the size of the portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood drops you will exceed your fat limit . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat quantity evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a low @-@ fat main court or a half @-@ rich secondary court , as you may have to appear in other programs for weight loss . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms are to be controlled by adjust@@ ing their diet . &quot;
&quot; • Medic@@ ines for children un@@ accessible . • You may not apply all@@ i to the specified exp@@ iry date . • Do not apply all@@ i to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;
do not swal@@ low this in any case . • You can lead your daily dose all@@ i to the blue transport box ( shuttle ) that the pack is attached .

overweight has influence on your health and raises the risk of the emergence of various severe diseases such as : • hyper@@ tension • diabetes • cereb@@ ral diseases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please contact your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; for instance , a permanent weight loss , for example through improving nutrition and more movement , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to feed healthy and healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in Kil@@ o@@ j@@ oule , which also provides information on the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake is to take advantage of how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
&quot; note the further below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat , which should take advantage of each meal . &quot;
&quot; which quantity is suitable for you , take the below information that gives the number of calories , which is suitable for you . • For the mode of mode of mode the capsule is crucial to comply with recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you have the same amount of fat to yourself , so far can this mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize the weight loss and reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related support . • You should try to gradually increase gradually . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually lose weight and dis@@ appointments approximately 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ strations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Straight physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn a daily 150 kcal daily , e.g. 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 minute gar@@ dening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic calcium and fat targets and keep it also . this makes sense to a food content with data to cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program for the support of weight loss combined the capsules with a food plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you can feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fet@@ ish@@ du@@ es , physically active . &quot;
&quot; in combination with an added support program for the support of weight loss , you can help to develop a heal@@ th@@ ier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used with chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are severe trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as c@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
&quot; the application for patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the substance stimul@@ ates a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , severe trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated with Alo@@ xi , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were treated with Alo@@ xi , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission granted a permit to Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indicated : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ itting chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and vomiting in severe em@@ itting chemotherapy due to a cancer disease .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vomiting , induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the colo@@ rec@@ tal cancer patients should be monitored using an@@ am@@ ne@@ ic ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection m@@ asch@@ ig .
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is offered with the same administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T intervals or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval extends or those of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; unless in connection with another chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi will not be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prehistoric studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in@@ hib@@ ited the activity of the five investigated chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( c@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady static concentration of met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ er@@ ids , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ TP D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ) and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( D@@ TP D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ in , Nit@@ r@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ ine , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ aring of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience to use Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied during pregnant women , unless it is considered necessary by the treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were observed ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi associated with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions at the appointment site ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar incidence of adverse events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups were observed ; no dose regim@@ es were observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed , due to the great distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis might not be effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - Over@@ do@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of cy@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ in and 250 mg of Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.3 hours ) received , that was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ ason intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ itting chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 mc@@ g Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were assigned to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results from studies with advanced @-@ based chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials involving chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of the clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block at the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers carried out the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of i.@@ a. in single doses of 0,@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease in the plasma concentration , a slow elim@@ ination of the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ time of about 40 hours . &quot;
&quot; the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration period curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ately in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 @-@ g / kg , with healthy and cancer patients . &quot;
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean postoperative ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; for pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ tic sim@@ ulations , the value measured at once daily intraven@@ ous gift of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron at 3 consecutive days reached overall exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) . however , the C@@ max was higher after the delay of 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys , and about another 50 % are eliminated in two primary metabol@@ ites , which are compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect at 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
in vitro studies for the metabolism have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
&quot; elim@@ ination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ changeable ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance was 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale elim@@ ination @-@ life and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction of dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered adequate over the maximum human exposure to clinical use which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
10 . investig@@ ational studies suggest that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers which may extend to the vent@@ ri@@ cular De@@ - and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose reported in about 30 times of therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which have been given daily for two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ours , p@@ itu@@ itary , pan@@ cre@@ as , side @-@ cre@@ as , epi@@ thel@@ ial cells and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but because of the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is intended for one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of this results will be low for humans . &quot;
&quot; the holder of these approval , the European Commission has to inform about the plans for the transport of this decision in the framework of this decision . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns stated that the data for the stability of the effectiveness and the marketing of medicines will not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C associated with the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A were similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on flame ret@@ ard@@ ant the disease back to more patients than at the reference rate ; furthermore , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test was applied to the investigation into the study , to what extent the drug forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not adequ@@ ately vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be applied to the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a cr@@ ust @-@ formation of skin infection ) and small in@@ jected in@@ firm@@ ities ( R@@ iss@@ - or slic@@ ing ) to be applied .
Al@@ tar@@ go shall not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven and probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ ma is not working against this type of infection .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients at the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years , patients may not exceed 2 % of body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not apply to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should re@@ examine the patient and re@@ consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works through blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial properties in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
main indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was withdrawn by the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients suffer from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under Placebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected people , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates showed : if the results of both studies have been taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ ood , about 90 % of the patients were involved in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( stolen cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or from infections , which were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation to the contractor .
&quot; the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of the following superf@@ icial skin infections pass over the risks of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ities , fail@@ ures or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the transport of al@@ tar@@ go into the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patient , in which there are no improvement in two to three days , should be taken once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a sen@@ sibility or severe local irrit@@ ation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is scheduled to be carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection has begun . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied for the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials involving secondary in@@ infected open wounds , the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin @-@ resistant forkli@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) , was insufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment there is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected place .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were obtained in humans following top@@ ical use on a soft skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically important in@@ hibition of vi@@ vo could not be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Fol@@ lowing an oral gift of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the average ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be increased from healthy adult men to 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the smaller system exposure to top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ ts are not kept for necessary , if top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction and are in@@ adequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and f@@ öt@@ ale / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; in pregnancy , Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is the gift of an systemic antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / terminated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / terminated is between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for infants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
&quot; in clinical studies , 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go applied , was the most commonly reported adverse events at the administration site that concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from fermentation of Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction between the 50s sub@@ type of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ omes that diff@@ ers from the bin@@ aries of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ ious substances .
data indicate that the bin@@ aries of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 are involved in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ Bin@@ ding Centre and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase@@ Centre .
&quot; due to binding to this binary , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line block the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl transfer , some P @-@ bin@@ aries inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active for more active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ val@@ ency of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some information forms , should be advis@@ able by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was brought up daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion and shot down for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice a day for 5 days for top@@ ical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
sampling was carried out in the days of 3 or 4 in adult patients each before medi@@ ation and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual systemic intake of people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 of o@@ wed skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng · h / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirts .
Met@@ abol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in Human liver micro@@ som@@ en was given primarily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in studies for oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , that were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes as well as in rats @-@ micro@@ core test for in @-@ vi@@ vo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither with male nor female rats signs of restricted fer@@ til@@ ity in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making up to 5 times higher exposure reached as the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development of development ( decreased body weight ) and maternal tox@@ icity . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the approval must ensure that a pharmaceutical application system is present in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application ( version 6,2 ) and works before the product is marketed as long as the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the approval for the transaction is required to perform closer detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ology plan , as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updating of the R@@ MP , which are agreed with CH@@ MP module . &quot;
&quot; as described in CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management System for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP will be submitted to the next peri@@ odic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms on the treated place , you should finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not turn any other salads , cre@@ ams or lo@@ oti@@ ations on the surface , which is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if it was not expressly stated by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the ano@@ inting from Ver@@ see on one of these surfaces , wash the job with water and ask your doctor for advice , if complaints occur . &quot;
&quot; after entering the Sal@@ be you can cover the affected area with a ster@@ ile band@@ age or Gaza , unless your doctor has given you to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in a aluminium tube with a plastic zi@@ pper , which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in a aluminum bag that contains 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix is used as part of a two doses existing vaccine , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when the immun@@ isation is a low risk of a hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses of the vaccine can be ended . &quot;
&quot; if a request for the hepatitis A or B is desired , ambient temperature can be given as an other hepatitis C or B vaccine . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act as stimul@@ ating the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) , &quot; as it can resist a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambient rix contains the same components such as the vaccine , which has been approved since 1996 , and has been approved for Twin@@ rix children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are applied to the protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix children are administered under one of three doses existing . &quot;
&quot; because ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data applied for the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ult , also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective effect for one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
ambient temperature conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of developing antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a hex@@ agon and a 12 @-@ month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain in the injection , redness , mat@@ icity ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not react sensiti@@ vely to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) must not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals , a approval for the transport of ambi@@ rix in the entire world . &quot;
&quot; the standard di@@ mm@@ ing plan for the prim@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a request for Hepatitis B is used as well as for Hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination raw material . &quot;
according to a prim@@ iti@@ gation with the combination of anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti @-@ body values are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccine .
&quot; it is not yet secured , whether immun@@ og@@ ents who have addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccination should be protected as protection as they may also be protected by immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
3 How in all injection sim@@ ulations should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the gift of the vacc@@ inated treatment options for medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately .
&quot; if a faster protection against hepatitis B is needed , the standard di@@ mm@@ ing scheme is recommended with the combination sim@@ ulations , which contains 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ able Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the immune system , a sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibody being achieved , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines may be required . &quot;
&quot; as a intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ eller , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ ots , ambient temperature can be in@@ compar@@ ably sub@@ cut@@ aneous sub@@ cut@@ aneous , as it can come to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine gift in these cases . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix was given in the form of separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tetra@@ vas@@ cular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cul@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ res@@ sive therapy or patients with immun@@ otherapy have to be assumed that possibly no adequate immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of these formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ icity , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency that was observed in the previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vaccine vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccination doses of a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines were administered at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants at the age of 12 to including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ ency of Pain and Mat@@ ern@@ ity at a calculation base per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not based on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of Ambi@@ rix was observed with 5@@ 9.1 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of patients after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; according to the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the volunteers , the Ambi@@ rix were given , over pain , over 6@@ 3.8 % were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination raw material . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Matcha was comparable high ( i.e. over the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects , the ambient temperature was compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ ulated ) . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain and mat@@ ures was low and comparable to the combination of combination @-@ sim@@ pl@@ ain@@ ees with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study of 1- up to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurr@@ ence of local actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that which was observed with the 3 @-@ cans combination sim@@ pl@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , during the 6- to 11@@ - year @-@ olds , there was a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at the injection unit ) per dose , not per pro@@ binding . &quot;
&quot; the percentage of vacc@@ inations , which reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses of vaccination , with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units format in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10 µg of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis C surface , was statistically significant . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies that were carried out in vacc@@ inations at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serv@@ ok@@ on@@ ization rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % was one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 . &quot;
&quot; the server rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 , given dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination raw material with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 289 people whose immun@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher than with the recommended dose of hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of 3 @-@ dose ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the termination of the full vaccination series ( i.e. , month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ cans vaccine with ambient temperature or a 3 @-@ cans vaccine with a combination of 360 ELISA units format in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and Anti @-@ H@@ BS @-@ antibodies were detected at least 24 months after the time of the Grun@@ ari@@ zation , and in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccination scheme , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected . &quot;
the immun@@ o@@ gene mutation observed in this study was comparable to the vaccination of 3 doses with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen used in a dose of 0.5 ml .
a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ines .
&quot; if the first dose of ambi@@ rix was administered at the same time with a combination of combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tetra@@ vas@@ cular per@@ t@@ uss@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ it@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ öt@@ t@@ ines vaccine , the immune response was sufficient . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed a similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ization rates as for the earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the reset en@@ code by eye note to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways such as by bathing in water @-@ contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly require a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix is not fully protected from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series was completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vacc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / her child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infection that may cause the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to those of a hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; if you have an allergic reaction to the Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; allergic reaction can be expressed by it@@ ching skin elev@@ ations , breath or swelling of the facial or the tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / her child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• if you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the use of the second vaccination dose ) .
&quot; in a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with ambient temperature . &quot;
&quot; instead , it will recommend you to encourage you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of active hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; the second vaccination dose of this vacc@@ inated with reduced content is generally given a month after the first dose , and should give you / your child a vaccination protection against termination of the vaccination series . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is suffering from people who were in@@ jected with severe bleeding . • If you are in@@ jected / her child due to a condition or treatment in your / its body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child is under@@ going a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis / under@@ go . &quot;
&quot; ambient temperature can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the response to the vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 Say to your doctor if you receive further medicines ( including those who can receive without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or used / her child shortly , or if you have been given or immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or did it in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if ambi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , ambient or l@@ act@@ ating women is not given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already showed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages up to 50 without need@@ les available .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which has become known since the approval of the first approval for the market , the CH@@ MP has been demonstr@@ ating that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambient temperature remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into circulation in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this product is limited because of its low patient exposure . &quot;

ammon@@ ium is administered - split by several single doses by meals - swallowed up by food or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y ( through the stomach ceiling in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) or a Nas@@ en@@ onde ( through the nose in the stomach @-@ leading tube ) .
&quot; this was no compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ium could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( an active medicine that could be compared to the active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , ammon@@ ium can also lead to loss of loss of acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; finally , the Committee on Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium is effective in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle . &quot;
ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; as a result of the condition of the disease at the time of admission only limited information to this medicine .
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , with which a completely enzyme type has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 living days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ fixed form ( in@@ complete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life ) , an indication of the use is hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , children who do not be able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ low problems , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is individually calculated in consideration of protein toler@@ ant , and for the growth and development of necessary protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate , or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution is required by Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ om@@ cin@@ ase deficiency need arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ low problems , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a exists if the tablets do not immediately arrive in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , equivalent to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; as a result , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with cont@@ ingent heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium stimul@@ us and ec@@ de@@ formation only with caution . &quot;
&quot; because metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; for sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate on young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ ons and a increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus an disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be noted whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted out of the breast milk during the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is con@@ tra @-@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these undes@@ ired events were assumed that they were not connected to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ an patient who developed an metabolic rate of du@@ bi@@ al , severe hypo@@ chlor@@ o@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a 5 @-@ month old small child with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) occurred .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate in an intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ iting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active connection with glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys .
impacts of impacts is seen in phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the separation of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ actic glut@@ amine nitrogen are produced . &quot;
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment started immediately to improve survival of survival and clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the early mani@@ fold form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ist , and the disease itself led to the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analog@@ y within the first life year . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ) , proteins derived diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids was it possible to increase survival rate in post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first life of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed with pregnancy during pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate came with many for mental disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
patients with a late mani@@ fold form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ inal en@@ cephal@@ opathy ) which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ium En@@ cephal@@ opathy and had been treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet was 98 % .
existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in treating treatment and in some patients may occur a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ dised to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ et@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in in@@ timi@@ dated healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after individual delivery as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites also was examined in cancer patients according to intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ lical disorders , or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ds ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) on the next morning , a phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate was shown in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were treated repeatedly with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentration in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
the drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine via the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ ical effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dos@@ ing an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is used either oral ( infants and children , who can swal@@ low no tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing problems ) or via a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ ite or a Nas@@ en@@ onde . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , babies and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ en@@ prot@@ eine in the plasma should be held within the standard range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early mani@@ fold lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate , or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase , sub@@ stitution is required by Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) of sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) of sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which is the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat econom@@ ists were exposed to the birth of Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic ( active met@@ abo@@ ons of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of Hirn@@ ger@@ de . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ an patient who developed an metabolic rate of du@@ bi@@ al , severe hypo@@ chlor@@ o@@ emia , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
particle chi@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea comparable ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess of excess cells .
&quot; based on research on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle , sodium phen@@ yl@@ di@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ actic glut@@ amine nitrogen are produced . &quot;
&quot; existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measur@@ able plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of no more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient must get the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so they can not exp@@ ire after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; when testing laboratory studies , you need to inform the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the breast@@ feeding you do not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the medicine could take over your breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases confusion , headache , distur@@ ban@@ ces , desc@@ end@@ ment of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ enti@@ re@@ ty , memory disorders and a deteri@@ oration of existing neurolog@@ ical states were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you determine one of these symptoms , you get immediately with your doctor or with the emergency intake of your clinic for a corresponding treatment in connection . &quot;
if you forget to forget AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the respective dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
&quot; changes of blood flow ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tes ) , dimin@@ ished appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , liquid pain , rash , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you may notice any side effects that are not in this user information . &quot;
they may not be used to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the dis@@ card and the container ship . &quot; may not be used to use the specified exp@@ iry date .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish colour and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If there are conducted laboratory studies , you need to tell the doctor that you can take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS spread on equal single doses or via a gast@@ ro@@ ist@@ el ( hose that runs through the stomach wall directly into the stomach ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( hose that is guided through the nose in the stomach ) .
&quot; 31 . remove a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate from the container , e.g. a measuring sco@@ op on the edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ules . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op from the container . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest , with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( cardi@@ ac valve ) without &quot; St@@ up@@ lift &quot; ( a abnormal measurement value at the electro@@ cardi@@ ac or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose of dose and the in@@ fusion may be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with anxiety or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in sole gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and an GP@@ I . &quot;
&quot; while the PCI was often used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a cl@@ asp ) and they received additional medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or re@@ vit@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who underwent a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding in which it was much more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox cannot be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as with people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems , or heart attack . &quot;
the Committee of Human@@ ist ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI Express substitute for Hep@@ arin .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission opened the Company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a approval for the transport of An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift trucks ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out another PCI in another result , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; directly before the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg is required , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ ability of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us @-@ gift of angi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) on under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitution should be careful and dil@@ uted before use and the bolt dose quickly be administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are treated with a PCI ( whether using bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be considered , and the ACT will be repeated 5 minutes after the second bolt . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dos@@ ing adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , and also with di@@ aly@@ sis patients is angi@@ ox ( see under section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with angi@@ ox can be led 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated hepat@@ ine or 8 hours after the termination of sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
• Con@@ duc@@ ted hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine • active bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or ir@@ reversible disease risk . • heavier kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully tested in treating symptoms and signs of blood pressure when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; when in PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most of the bleeding occurs in arter@@ ial Pun@@ ishment , patients who occur in per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , while the treatment in principle occur worldwide . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be drawn up with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be reached again before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge about the action mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ um ( hepat@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ag@@ ulation ) may be assumed that these active ingredients may increase the risk of blood . &quot;
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ ten@@ ant inhibit@@ ors or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters in any case regularly .
&quot; the animal experiments are in@@ adequate in terms of impact on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , integration or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone ; 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either in@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ ar@@ ine groups , women and patients were more than 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined after the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measure of heavy bleeding as in the foot@@ notes of chart 2 .
both light and heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or blood pressure , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 4 g / dl with unknown blood pressure , re@@ operation due to blood pressure , use of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed blood loc@@ ali@@ z@@ ations that occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; Pun@@ ishment , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gast@@ ro@@ sem@@ ary , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects are based on data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients receiving a PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ ar@@ ine groups , women and patients were more than 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages occurred significantly less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive use in practice and are arranged according to system organs in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the treatment with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ity is immediately abolished and the patient is close to super@@ st@@ aging a bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ oc@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the an@@ ide @-@ binding region of th@@ rom@@ bin , regardless of whether Th@@ rom@@ bin is bound in the liquid phase or close to Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ rom@@ bin , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ rom@@ bin conf@@ esses the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generates the function of the active centre of Th@@ rom@@ bin . &quot;
&quot; in addition , bi@@ valent induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ ology / he@@ par@@ in@@ induc@@ tive thro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) had been induced in the past to induc@@ ing Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ ical syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy volunteers and patients with patients showing biological and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect caused by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out below the patients below , an additional bolt from 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered in@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .
patients in arm A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high risk factors , which required a angi@@ ography within 72 hours , evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for treating adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , in@@ jected or in@@ jected or the upper arm or in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
&quot; diabetes is a disease , which the body does not produce enough insulin in the blood of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin is not effective . &quot;
&quot; insulin is diff@@ ers in a very low level of human insulin , and the change means that it has faster and shorter effici@@ encies than a short @-@ effective human@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was in use in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies involving a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body of insulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indic@@ ator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human standard . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin resistance , or one of the other components , or in patients who suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is either sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection to either apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin capacity , the insulin consumption of patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; every change of the power volume , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ eth , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin needs . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dosage or departure of a treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ des ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient based on another insulin type or insulin is required under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
&quot; the time of occurr@@ ence of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin , and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; the substances which can increase the blood sugar @-@ corro@@ sive activity and increase the incl@@ ine to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , oxi@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , bi@@ kin@@ c@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic acid , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ e@@ oly@@ tics such as beta @-@ block@@ ers , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ dering anti@@ pre@@ ference may be dimin@@ ished or absent . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies for reprodu@@ ci@@ icity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ly in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether the insulin is over@@ lap in human breast milk , but generally insulin is neither in breast milk over , still it is res@@ or@@ ating after oral use . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials , sorted by system organs and arranged according to the frequency of their occurr@@ ence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 ; often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; cold w@@ ess , cool and bl@@ asse skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or Tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhau@@ st@@ ion or weakness , confusion , concentration distur@@ ban@@ ces , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy is failed to change the injection unit within the area of injection , can occur in the result of a po@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy in the injection . &quot;
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness levels may be given by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropri@@ ated person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ ing injec@@ tions , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the elem@@ ental cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
&quot; insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose consumption ( especially through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) , as well as by the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver . &quot;
&quot; studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery times faster and the mode of action is shorter than in hu@@ - , normal @-@ insulin . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine showed a proportional glu@@ ing effects , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional effect of glu@@ ing effects , just like human@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; insulin sens@@ ing has a twice as fast effect unit , such as normal human@@ ist and achieves the complete glu@@ ing effects of approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; the data was evident that at an application of is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ den@@ di@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with the normal standard , 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was reached before meal , which was 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is reached in 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal - a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , like in the normal standard , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( before the beginning of the meal , before the beginning of the meal , the 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human standard , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN : later ) after the beginning of the meal , compared to human standards , the 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) was given before the beginning of the meal ( Figure c ) . &quot;
