<seg id="6">"Abilify is used for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems, if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to the injections or the processed tablets in patients, which prepares the swallow of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients receiving other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be mined, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs the signal data between brain cells through "neurotransmitters" which means chemical substances that allow communication to the nerve cells.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol probably affects as "partial agist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Aripiprazol like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in lower degree than the neurotransmitter seems to enable the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"because Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are playing a role, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which causes psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, to prevent re-occur symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injection solution was compared with schizophrenia or similar diseases associated with schizophrenia or similar diseases associated with a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent re-occur in 160 patients with whom the manian symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injectionsolution was compared with a study in 301 patients with bipolar disorder which litteth in increased restlessness, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients were examined using a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients receiving treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution for adjusting).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two trials, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly higher reduction in symptoms increased significantly more than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo diagnosed with previously untreated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses reduced also more effective than placebo perceived symptoms of disturbance and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to the intake (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extractoral disorders (drowsiness), headache, Nausea (drowsiness), headache, Nausea (severe spreadiness), nausea and exhaustion, impuranium, insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee of humanist (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium-to-severe episodes of patients who had mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, confronted the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injection solution in the fast control of increased restlessness and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar disorder, if an oral therapy is not appropriate against the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission awarded the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for the acquisition of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe episodes of the bipolar disorder and for prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a rate of 15 mg / day a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been detected.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors are clear (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from combination therapy, the Aripiprazol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treating Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that patients with bipolar disorder had no increased suicides risk using Aripiprazol compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, cardiac disease, overflow disorders), cerebral diseases, conditions which are used for hypotonia (dehydration drugs) or hypertension (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Aripipraxis dynasty."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if used with ABILIFY, patients and symptoms of a late dynasty occur, should be moved to reduce the dose, or to break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient has developed signs and symptoms designed to indicate a mns, or not a clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics must be removed, including ABILIFY."</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, Aripiprazol should be used in patients with seizures in anhistory or with states that are related to seizures, with caution."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazol increased in comparison to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, in one of these studies, a study with fixer dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to unwanted fragile events at Aripiprazol patients were treated."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoazides or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including ABILIFY."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar Manie due to comorbidities, the application of anti-psychotic effects, in which weight gain is observed, and could lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazol on the central nervous system, be careful when Aripiprazol is used in combination with alcohol or other central-effective medicines with overlay side effects such as seals (see paragraph 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the result rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is not considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripiprazol by 107% while the Cmax remains unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected to expect that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have to be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites can result in higher plasma concentration of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6 extensively metabolites compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift of ketoconazole or other high-effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, the potential benefit should weigh potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other high-effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore should be done similar dosing reductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after setting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage should be increased from ABILIFY to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"dilemazem or Escalopram or CYP2D6 are administered together with ABILIFY, can be expected with a moderate increase of Aripiprazol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol has no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextromethylan / 3-methodology morphine ratio), 2C9 (Warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to inform their doctor if they are pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the inadequate data base for the safety of human beings and due to the recurrative concerns of the animal, this medication may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk of the foetus."</seg>

<seg id="73">"in fact, no information on the effectiveness of a hematalysis treatment with Aripiprazol, however, is unlikely to have hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose of benefit, as Aripiprazol has a high plasma binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol is mediated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazol showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor, and a moderate affinity to Dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenches and to the Histamin-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for treating adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes, which require treatment with insulin delivery."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, injected or injected or the upper arm or infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"diabetes is a disease, which the body does not produce enough insulin in the blood of glucose (sugar) in the blood or process insulin is not effective."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"insulin is differs in a very low level of human insulin, and the change means that it has faster and shorter efficiencies than a short-effective humanist."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was in use in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies involving a total of 1 549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body of insulin is not effective, Apidra was examined in a study of 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin-lispro."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"in adults with type 2 diabetes, the reduction in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human standard."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Apidra must not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive (allergic) against insulin resistance, or one of the other components, or in patients who suffer from hypoglycaemia."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the doses of Apidra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines, which can affect blood glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH a approval for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra is either subcutaneous injection to either apply or subcutaneous injection as subcutaneous injection as subcutaneous injection or subcutaneous injection.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin capacity, the insulin consumption of patients with a limitation of liver function can be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"every change of the power volume, the brand (Her- Steller), the insulin (normal, NPH, zinketh, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin needs."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An inadequate dosage or departure of a treatment, especially in patients with an insulin-dependent diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoazides; these states are potentially life threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient based on another insulin type or insulin is required under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"the time of occurrence of a hypoglycaemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin, and can therefore change in conversion of the treatment scheme."</seg>

<seg id="2991">"after a gluing injections, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the elemental cause of severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose consumption (especially through skeletal musculature and fat), as well as by the inhibition of glucose production in the liver."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at subcutaneous Ga- be of insulin delivery times faster and the mode of action is shorter than in hu-, normal-insulin."</seg>
