&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part is translated to the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translation are only very ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary . Bab@@ el@@ fish produced in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore should the translations be no important decisions dependent without checking the translation before .
&quot; you can only translate websites on the Internet . other texts should be translated directly to the Bab@@ el@@ fish site , where you can insert a translated text directly . &quot;
&quot; the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its low size , they offer some additional functions and simpli@@ fy some functions of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , by sending them easier . &quot;
for further information on the use of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and in built @-@ in functions you will find in the manual to &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select settings for extensions ... Open the boxes , select the desired modules . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the K@@ DE package ; please note that any more modules are installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you compiled this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on the ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the listing , if present . &quot;

the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; provides a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local fil@@ esystem .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in it , f@@ aked folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . each object is given by a rectangle with its size . this size must possess the property that the sum of the size of the underground objects is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of entries in it . accordingly , large files can be easily recognized if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . accordingly , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the staircase to display a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation use the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful colour and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle , which is switched to color mode , can either represent depth for light detection of the screws or figure of another file association like name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature you can define whether they may be displayed at all , if enough space is present at the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . in addition , you can set the relative position of labels in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; with characteristics algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should be respected that the surface is proportional to size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target will not always be placed . if you need space , then the lower entries will be lost , if the rectangle is square , if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; according to the distribution of the area of a entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left to implement . in this case , it is possible for labelling and avoiding spaces that are possible to create space as possible . the best methods of this area are lines , columns or recur@@ sive second . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal space for one entry on the menu entry view . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn in the area of the superior entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;

&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder , the images contains as basic folder . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . if you are looking for a sub@@ folder , you &apos;ll see a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; thirsty recur@@ sively the library sp@@ ad in its whole depth . you can no sub@@ folder and you can do it in a plug@@ ged file ; you can add one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base file , you will notice that the albums in my Al@@ en@@ kl@@ ist will not take photos as symbols . you can change the album by clicking on the folder symbol . this will then be used as an album symbol . for more details , please see section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also be done . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a specific camera is supported , you will find a list of supported Roh@@ kam@@ eras to the help of Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ support . &quot;
&quot; as you set up and work with raw files , described in the phases of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h labor sequence . &quot;
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface will be available to you with your digital camera and supported your photos directly into &amp; di@@ gi@@ . -@@ albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course each medium and each card readers will be supported by your operating system ; working together with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver .
modern digital cameras are characterized by using the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is often used as record drive . older cameras can also use serial port protocol ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; the program g@@ phot@@ 2 is used for communication with digital cameras . Photo@@ 2 is a free , secondary software collection for digital cameras which supports a constant number of more than 800 cameras supported by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it allows the transmission of pictures of digital cameras to host computers and other peripher@@ als without the need additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for your communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general large files are slow and transfers over the serial port is slow ; it supports these cameras and performs the transmission of pictures featuring g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras will be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so you can read the advantages of di@@ gi@@ K@@ am reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may possibly be able to see any kind of lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to be di@@ gi@@ fted ; is how easy his functionality is enlarged by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to develop a joint module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ . , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ l and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
modules can manipul@@ ate pictures in virtually any manner as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is much easier &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to complement one function as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; itself .
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page sizes with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and remove images everywhere : you can lay a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ms , via the horizontal separation line or to another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , file list or searching . &quot;

&quot; and di@@ gi@@ fted ; characterized by a long number with a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . these allows the images to compare these Sign@@ atures . the lower the difference between two image signals , the more they meet . this technique will be applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar items : this is a range in which you can fall in any picture . by a swelling , the results can be increased or reduced to a picture of somewhere about the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : free @-@ hand colour sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and di@@ gi@@ raffe ; finds the appropriate pictures . also here a swelling can be set .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ atures . you can then move out with the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move up a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is sure that your pictures contains Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filters . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ ord@@ ner .
&quot; you got a lumin@@ aire in a separate window available with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including shell files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The table will be added to the table menu and open its window . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; main windows , you can open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L Extras . &quot;
&quot; you can compare the pictures you compare to see in the left or right area of the window and leave there . a small arrow indicates that copy in which window area is done . if you are synchron@@ ize synchron@@ ization of one of the images , then they will compare the same area of both images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to import quickly from a series of images . if you want to navigate in pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will be automatically displayed in the right area . in the right area , the left button will be displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to pass through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal soldering actions are also working directly from the table , such as F4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main panel are available for both gu@@ ardi@@ ans in the fluorescent table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can view to the visible range of the picture , you need to click and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both pictures will show the same image section . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as in other views . simply use the zoom controllers under the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum in the picture in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are looking ahead in mode .
what is a digital inventory management - away from the fashion word ? digital data management considers the picture made until the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos is sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital data management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and photos to use . we look at the procedure for digital photographs the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons . we look at the download , ren@@ aming , backup , evaluate , evaluate , authenti@@ cation , archive , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management Administration takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , trans@@ forming , transformed , conf@@ ection@@ ed and exported content made by a mon@@ et@@ ype or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data which will be administered by an application or environment .
&quot; I could not claim that if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find any specific photo . if you don &apos;t know how many photos you do , then you do not know &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; . the base met@@ ad@@ ata can be stored in a database as well as in the image files , and you can use secure archi@@ ving for you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first you need to do and know before you want to maintain something in your system . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to store them on a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . tourist images can be found quickly about your location . if you were able to organize enough photos , then you will download sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have different requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing of photos , archi@@ ving , labor processes , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files and you will then want to organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option to store the met@@ ad@@ ata in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ . this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , you can then select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what happens ; to them a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should have to point every photo , words , labelling and an evaluation . of course , you can select the same attribute and then set the value . you will start to focus on the best pictures , as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s now use key words , key words , as you will continue in other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from a different source with embedded sample word , then it is not a problem and can easily be done by removing a sub@@ tree to another place . the changing keywords will be followed by &amp; di@@ gi@@ vings ; updated during the sub@@ trees . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows like different met@@ ad@@ ata . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data have all the pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labelling or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ ate your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; most of them don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing is . Wow ! one begins to dream , associations , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence of this panorama as completely . &quot;
&quot; for others that look at your photos is the title probably more important than the picture itself . if you should show images , you should tell a story . remember , the key is the meaning of the viewer to help him understand what you are moving . &quot;
it is ok if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with a labelling for themselves .
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ck ; you can create a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can also export him for a selection of images at the same time . K@@ DE can also tell you for a choice of images in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems , so you will not have to tell the story for opening hours . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train de@@ parts of the spatial presentation now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already nar@@ r@@ able and can be seen in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can also export your journeys using ge@@ ographic information . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also in all modified versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; as information should be deposited on :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for educ@@ ators and author ) : this field should be used for your name , or the name of the photographer , i.e. , if it is not desired to protect the name of the photographers , so it should not be changed any more . this field does not support Com@@ ma nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author itel ( syn@@ onym for the author ) : linked to the author . examples of the photographer includes the work name of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a note to the author , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the an@@ bi@@ dder field to identify and identify the photo . if the photographer wants to be correct . if the photo is a photo agency like Reuters or Associated Press , you can see the picture here . if the picture is an inventory here , this picture will be given here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in the work with calcul@@ ator , can change them in the image of your photos . for individuals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important for this protection . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; will provide such a module for pil@@ ing processing .
&quot; topics : record error , plate loss , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs on the road or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section , there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll @-@ track , the world &apos;s largest database management company , has some interesting statistics that has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , they must be treated to you no longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers of gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that can claim a lifetime of 100 years for themselves . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ ks and good recording . the best DVD recording are not much more reliable than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . so it turns so to the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you were just written . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need to protect them through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it &apos;s not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that have damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , HD@@ Ds , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to save the For@@ mat@@ era against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disk can store 50 GB , and thus it &apos;s almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course everything has been said to be used for Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; slow down with a good recording to high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . please do not hesitate to copy the data to the next generation of media , before you can read the data on the next generation of media or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ car@@ ers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s production include a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study about the trouble mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ si@@ f@@ ters &quot;
&quot; soon : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The most common fault cause , SM@@ ART can not notice this error . some of the SM@@ ART can be determined . these are especially readers and re@@ vis@@ itation . the expected life period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also use data loss due to a power out@@ set before you have secured the files , but this losses may normally recover without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment doesn &apos;t make too much , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed spro@@ uts are different . these may cause severe damage , hard@@ switch @-@ age and other defects . protect themselves from the inev@@ itable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most common protection against power peaks is a over@@ voltage protection . this is a tool that is part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest is exhausted . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ panel . remember that not each plug @-@ in bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should consider that it provides the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects the protection against lighten@@ ment , and thus protects the correct devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that any peripher@@ als are connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide super@@ tension , and also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection possibilities for co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , so you are also very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . that &apos;s ideal for you . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection your system protects your system against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the current lines , it can &apos;t really help you . even a few seconds can result in loss of un@@ ce@@ asing data . it can therefore be sensible to invest in an un@@ interrupted power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically increase battery energy if a power cut down . some models allow them to continue to save up until the current . if you want to buy the same quality requirements such as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the battery life of the battery and the supplied software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the potential risk to prevent your computer system , and compare its safety against the costs of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V allows you to drink all the cables before you go into the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - easy storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as backup goal for your software . Google shared Storage is another popular offer to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to the hard drives at home , however , you are exceeding expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you must send the data on compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general securing solution . this is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available on photos . their free memory is available on 1 GB , and you &apos;ll get your pictures no longer available , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 a year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed only in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are very safe . data transfer errors will be automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the major firms are included in the offer a backup and a divi@@ der storage . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ous . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are pr@@ one for transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data impact between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one has occurred to you when a transmission error occurred . all of these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you know one day . nobody seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly safer data way than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission lu@@ sts , as they create inter@@ ferences within the data stream . in normal file systems this error remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently being affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can circum@@ vent one of two candidates and is highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it is still using the same protection mechanisms , which is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel . &quot;
do not under@@ estimate that ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of workplace systems . not@@ ebooks are already the share of rob@@ bers 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less widespread than most of them . it is limited to a lower damage , than for example theft or re@@ installation . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; it has been no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less pr@@ one for data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS for the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : false , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and a defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely stored before the problem appeared , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors from digital cameras are located 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that technology continues to develop a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and space characteristic for all kinds of lip sensors are no longer far away from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather wor@@ sen@@ ed . a sensor size of 6 Megapixel and a high @-@ quality look requires a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not get any other data loss for data loss . thus , make your data frequently affected by a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous than the new installation of your operating system , exchange plates or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; take advantage of your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash , you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ ie means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the steps up into the neighbouring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above , a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; full backup : a complete backup of all files are to be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differentiation : a backup of files have been changed since the last complete insurance , generates a complete snap@@ shot at two time points : the complete safegu@@ arding and the last differentiation . &quot;
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . generates several times . you can recover the original status at any time again . this f@@ use comes next with the exception that it only uses , and not continuously running . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files that really have been changed . this happens when you would like to increase security about ssh .
&quot; ass@@ ure important images , after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical media . &quot;
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore . at the same time , you come to backup . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for every month , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC files , original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ locate images and met@@ ad@@ ata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; thus valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time span in which you are really interested in you because you remember your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able because of your nature , you need to consider with caution and re@@ evaluate it during the time . unfortunately , there are no other option than a certain wax backward . depending on the time you have used the current system backward , the more easier is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system that is important to reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s go out what you plan to have the scal@@ ability with plans and put the area you need to have a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and lay it onto a new record :
&quot; with the command d@@ mes@@ g , check whether your new plate has been recognized by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
/ dollar ; dd if = / dev / S@@ DC # Source : / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC &amp; dollar ; size of the plate in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size by Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day doesn &apos;t find any software anymore , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier for year by year . &quot;
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format which dis@@ appears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG has been replaced as an open source standard , but it can be much more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . the dis@@ advantage , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs and you would recommend this format to save your pictures . &quot;
&quot; T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as an aspect ratio . T@@ IF@@ F can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a low @-@ loss compression surface . however , it is managed to save your pictures in this format . however , it is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The digital negative file format is a licensed and open image format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the need of met@@ ad@@ ata . it is based on the need of met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer uses D@@ NG now and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ forms ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a characteristic of XML and R@@ DF ; the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers draw it in front of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to view archi@@ ved . X@@ MP fits the link between the met@@ ad@@ at@@ ry file and the image file and as mentioned above , you should use whether you use D@@ NG as container and put everything there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization responsible for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards , supporting a wide range of purposes and modelling , discussions and community workshops , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ful efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera field , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert shell files to D@@ NG and save them in your shell archives . this feature is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine processing , you can use external programs . if you return the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut down by the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , add in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ . in the section add a photos to an album , you can already add photos that you already have on your hard disk . the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ ell bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; to use , connect these with the machine , turn the camera on display mode and turn off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , you are trying to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a Fer@@ tig indicator is displayed on the lower end and the front images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras will display no gu@@ ide@@ als on the camera . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for the file association for each file , photos , movies , music , etc . ) are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need to see the camera information on any entry . with the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of a single and its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialogue features file properties and the photo information that internally are stored in the camera . a symbol indicates that the picture has not been downloaded from your computer . note that at some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; the rider met@@ ad@@ ata displays the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remark , GPS etc . of the image . these information is the same as at the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ ad@@ ata is not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer , click on the button to download and then download the photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ . . download the photos from their camera to download if the pictures will be downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the pictures with the default optional methods of &amp; K@@ DE . once you select the photos , use the button to download and then select the button . the button is selected as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; when your camera supports this , a new option is available now . these pictures have been selected yet by &amp; di@@ gi@@ . in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in the front window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you can download the buttons All download or select selected , a dialog box , which you can select the target album , will be displayed in the photos below . the list of existing records will be displayed as normal folder . select the target album from the list , and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all on once by delete the button delete all . if you want to delete just some , you have to select this first and delete delete delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore from the camera , you will be deleted . these photos are not deleted from the camera . if you want to delete the photos successfully in a &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; they should be deleted , if you want to delete the camera , because this is considerably faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras often use as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently used as fil@@ en@@ ame . this data can be deleted after photos from the camera . this can be done to double file names , if you have taken photos from different recording criteria into the same album , if you have done photos from different recording criteria into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and sk@@ e@@ wers of the picture and for date @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ps . if you use this latter option , automatically creates a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission will open three more options , which are done before the photos are stored on the plate . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for any downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another file format as the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % S : % S . turn the default date and time you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; when you use the camera file names , you have the opportunity to change the file names in small letters . or in capital letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name , which the camera is available in the preview . your settings are stored and automatically used when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; and di@@ gi@@ fted ; can use all information on the camera &apos;s orientation for the time point of recording to perform a automatic rotation during the break . not all cameras make this information ready . in the page page bar met@@ ad@@ ata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and when your camera does not deliver this information , you can turn off the automatic turning point . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turn in the lower part of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has been made available via the date at which the photo was made , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; this sub@@ al@@ ps are based on the image data . all images with the same date will be available in the same sub @-@ album . all pictures with the same date will be available in the same sub @-@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can check that information your camera could have been embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in that case it stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to switch to the button . use the button @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ps at the bottom end of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos from their calcul@@ ator to your camera is the button Download . select the file extensions dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can select the files that are uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods .
&quot; once the picture selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ck ; you , where the images should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to get the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude . the identification of data can be displayed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability to use . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser to the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; users want to locate the place of the photos , or simply have to document the position of photos of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as the direction , traction and card refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a re@@ work of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for the geographical assignment ( manual ) and last about the manual input from known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS recipi@@ ents . either as a card module or via transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be made with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , these data must be saved in the GP@@ X format , as it is the only format that is supported by the module for ge@@ ographic mapping . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data of pictures and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; make g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script by using the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the sign @-@ based coordinates that can be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;

&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ar@@ did@@ acy and copyright Data . these data are written automatically to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the option to download from a camera interface , these data will be written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this field may be as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the car field , this should also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers . do not use this field to provide the photo . this does not have to be the author as this for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , then this organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . thereby , the met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently contained in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ . this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported to &amp; di@@ gi@@ . imported . &quot;

the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button on the right of each category .
&quot; the setting of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; can be set on the default values . every pictures , however , you can only use different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode , you should only use different sizes and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode . if you have a few pictures and the syn@@ ch@@ rone mode is then not available . if you have one , then you can get better results . &quot;
&quot; by default , the image processing is using a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can turn this here . you can use the tool@@ bar when you use image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and interru@@ pt@@ ing areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture , these colors are defined here . in the editing mode this review mode can be inserted with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , the pictures in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance can be encoded as in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia to be higher . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG needs a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means a low and 9 compression . &quot;
&quot; using the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate column for T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; with the adjustment of non @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss . even if you were posted the loss of loss , the relationship between quality loss and file size is better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported yet , but was in the planning stage . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , the image processing was only one image viewer for photos . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for mani@@ pulation of your photos . with this dialogue , you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard point is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this is a bit soft , elimin@@ ating this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option shows the picture a bit soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 gin pattern using the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white sounds like the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used if the white is not set off . standard is a fixed color balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
&quot; this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors , the effect that under@@ pin@@ ned pictures in four steps more details will be ignored . for other cameras , this option will be ignored . &quot;
&quot; the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned , because of the in@@ ability of your camera , use the pointed @-@ in white into the settings . last@@ ly , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the per@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general cannot be satisfied as fast as green and red . &amp; di@@ gi@@ w , and d@@ cra@@ w are trying to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set him a little higher than standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic . in order to maintain the time for Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should go conservative . &quot;
a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle date that have many cameras and have a Matrix coloured pixel . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour structure .
&quot; and di@@ gi@@ w came ; and D@@ cra@@ w are available to you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests , it was created as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color of your lenses , you can set the red and blue o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a different color correction , since you are being carried out during the conversion . &quot;
one profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons ; information like the color information from a color space to translate the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; behavior questions , if a picture is opened in the image processing / color management module with shell files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile folder S@@ ing here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; examine these folders during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles , you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to rear . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later . &quot;
the color of the color view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color managed not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be done to the camera manufacturers and model you are using . not all profiles are contained on the same type . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma not for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to carry the paint mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are more options like the soft Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate , as your image can be done by a device as your printer can print a smaller color area than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , rather than you can rely on the blind algorith@@ ms of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is pretty obvious what color profile is due for them . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , a table of cameras and pro@@ positions can be fit together . this answer is obviously un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension allows the style to recognize : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image viewer and imag@@ inations ; many modules are written to cooperate with each program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the list of available modules . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and additionally you will find some even in the context menu of the fore@@ see . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which are carried out by modules , can be set in the menu with short commands . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted the time between the successive outputs , usually are 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other check@@ boxes switch off the met@@ ad@@ ata a or that appears at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection , which is connected to the computer . if you want to use it , make sure that the camera is connected to the computer . currently there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass memory . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have chosen a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / O , to which you depend on your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , switch to display mode and switch off . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you out if &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the camera automatically recognis@@ es . if not , you can manually set cam@@ er@@ o@@ dell and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu . &quot;
you can select any name for your camera . these will be displayed in the menu of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for the shifting of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ can display you can adjust the conversation between &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons ; you can adjust the conversation of a photo in an album . in the sections of a photo and delete a album you will find more details .
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut @-@ down through &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; applied , if you use the changes to the right side bar without question . otherwise you have to apply the changes with the button change . &quot;
you can also bind the display of a welcome screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ vings ; in Star@@ ts . this acceler@@ ates the start of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons under conditions .
&quot; the setting of the start of new photos are sub@@ du@@ ed &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extended the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . if something from the base file , you will ask &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted it ; you , whether it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; used to adjust the main window to your taste . these settings can be found under the settings design in the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested , a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; to create , find further information about this tut@@ orial . &quot;
and di@@ gi@@ fted ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or selection of the updated advertis@@ ements / editing .
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ . so they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be set up in the section of image processing .
&quot; status bar at the bottom edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; one menu bar at the top edge , among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions . &quot;
&quot; editing functions change your photos . however , do not change the original photo before you can store or save the text save from the tool@@ bar . please note that if you don &apos;t want to restore the original photo , once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you might need to make a copy of your image , before you change it . you can save with file save . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not stored the photo , you can restore the original image by selecting from the menu file restart or restore the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; almost any action of the image processing can be re@@ formed or recovered . the last promotion , you can res@@ emble back re@@ lin@@ eup or re@@ produced using editing re@@ produce from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z for re@@ lin@@ eup and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ ber @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; you will get a moment longer , you will get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also taken in between and again . &quot;
&quot; once you started editing the image , you can use the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture down , or the entries in the menu file . if you have done changes on the current photo , you will be asked if you want to back up . &quot;
you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; Maus@@ oleum or symbols in tool@@ bar or entries in the tool@@ bar menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : the magni@@ fication factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you will be displayed in the normal view , in which you can &apos;t use the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t like this , you can call it from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ raffe . see this section to set the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image file and receive the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can download the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole pro@@ positions . all photo sites can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the default settings and you will need to follow the menu album exp@@ orting printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard , you just need your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which is important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation system , even if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear again and disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the attri@@ bution view , you can enter inscri@@ ptions with unlimited size or insert . please note that the text is UTF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields , so that you may be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data support only ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut according to 2000 characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should be aware of these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you comments on , you can either use the button , or switch to the next image , the labelling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; besides the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata out of the selected file or the database . but you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . this will always be done if you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata setting . &quot;
&quot; the Assessment section shows an evaluation scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting order . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or by the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations Str@@ g + 0 ... 5 . in order to evaluate multiple pictures simultaneously , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written into the IP@@ TC field . encoding process follows the scheme in the following table :
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering of the stit@@ ches that came in the key@@ word and a selection box with the previously mentioned in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ on@@ - session .
the key@@ word will be adapted dynam@@ ically to the appropriate search phrase . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief for the input of sample records at a series of images . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be put through marking the appropriate check@@ box in the tree . all tags of the image will be stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; select if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word , this will only be applied to the selected image and not to the entire selection , if you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . normally , the left side bar will be used with their album , - disk , key@@ word and search purposes . if in addition one or more sampling filters are displayed in the right side only . all written words are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also tags and leave . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view , you can drag it from the right side bar and put it to the selection . subsequently , a dialog appears if you want to place the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on one calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to no keywords . they were picked up with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards , a key@@ word from the right hand @-@ tree was taken on the selection and later put a dialogue to whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
these search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry , which is searched for the database . this may be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced Search via all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you just need the check@@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve mostly adapted to &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why to create a color administered workflow is the colors that have actually photographed from your camera or scanners are a pre@@ dict@@ able deviation from the fact that the colors are available on your monitor from your camera , or scanners , and the colors that you print from your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the theme comes to color management , everyone would like to know which buttons needs to press for the results . unfortunately , colour administration means that you make informed decisions at each point of image processing work@@ flows . additionally , you should make your own informed decisions to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow is fulfilled every six below criteria , you do not need to worry about color management . &quot;
&quot; they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB @-@ color space . ( further information , see below ) &quot;
&quot; their only other image issues are via e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB the de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well , and life for all so easy , why should I use another color space and make thoughts about dy@@ es ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ isen@@ ular region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color bro@@ wn@@ ings , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent page and then click Information About RGB working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to break my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB @-@ color space or not , you need to start your monitor , since s@@ RGB mode is coming to the circle . if you are working as the color space of s@@ RGB , you have to use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool represents five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . do not use it before you try a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , compare , automation and contrast from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ iting Autom@@ atically automatically try to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize this method sc@@ aled the Leu@@ st@@ icker values across the entire image , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color sha@@ kes . this feature is often a magical correction for pictures the dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; identical : this method is adjusted the lumin@@ escent factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of intensity channels is as flat as possible . this is sometimes a very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it produces only a very powerful operation , which causes either mar@@ vel at a picture or destroyed it . &quot;
&quot; automatic cut : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright level tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire history . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in between the highest and highest values in between , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the White immediately made of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white edges of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ like correction is slightly restricted to over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are working too far from the original picture , if you can perform the white edges in the raw mode , which can be done in 16 @-@ bit mode , so are your options for correction better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white ab@@ bal@@ m of the copyright , protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you will launch it over the menu entry colors white like photo editing . &quot;
&quot; the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original picture can be seen as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original protein &apos;s original size , then it is enough to click on the bottom window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the lumin@@ ance of the pist@@ ol of this mark@@ er is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; to the right above , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that dynam@@ ically changes if you have a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful because one of the three colors or your sum will be displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or download . &quot;
&quot; note with the af@@ ore@@ mentioned controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then take place somewhere on the picture to calculate the color temperature of the white tin@@ ent . this type will also be set automatically the temperature and green values . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the White immediately with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the trans@@ duc@@ er di@@ ator increases the colors , if more than a color channel of the pist@@ ol is exposed .. you will see the combined result in the white lim@@ b . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator , and has no effect on the final picture . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and shop make exactly this . every setting of the white , which you have set you can hereby store and shop later . &quot;
&quot; the kno@@ cking pre@@ ferences puts all the filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white ab@@ normal@@ ities . please note that neutral settings are a different photo than your original . when you store this , your original picture will be changed . &quot;
&quot; here you can adjust the coefficient per color channel of the working image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the far widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better for high @-@ quality images . this coding is also required for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool gives the same dialog like the editing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be carried out by the sub@@ panel for the use of color fil@@ s you can withdraw the chapter of color management .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu below colors . this tool represents an integrated way to adjust and allows you to use multiple colour channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always require the same mistakes and you can always need the same correction . in manual for audio correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool to gra@@ dation that you can find under colour gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ant ; tool color defects provides you four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect that was created when one was partially developed by a short flash and afterwards the development of the image . this result was a partial neg@@ atively image of the image . this tool was a partial negative image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase was created , that is not to create a negative image that is not on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar panel . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation by giving a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus , a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated fatty colors are also some photographs , especially those who are barely visible landscapes . &quot;
&quot; the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on light on the contra@@ diction . parameter Level controls the brightness of the results , and the sliding repeat repet@@ itions the strength of the ninth grade . in large pictures , the filter may be loaded the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to change colour control and the lumin@@ osity of photos using the tools in the menu . once you are happy with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you are used .
&quot; if you do a photo of bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be a good choice for satur@@ ation instead . if Him like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tools gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is also very complicated to improve the exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need for the use of use only the range of sli@@ ders . concrete the three shooting below the history program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , an hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph are three sli@@ ders in the click on and the left side represents the dark and the right side represents the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way of operation to learn is to move the controllers , and to consider how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be seen . the preview will be dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y @-@ axis is often portra@@ yed . in pictures of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram of a single pillar is dominated by a single pillar . in this case the logical hist@@ ogram process is useful .
&quot; three kno@@ b : the top for the dark tones , the medium for bright tones and the lowest for the medium tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin chains can be used in the preview of the original image , in order to adjust the inputs of the shade , middle and light tones automatically . furthermore , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; uti@@ lization : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used in order to evaluate the output values . for example , the compression of output values can be used as a background to create something else in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; store and load : using these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later . in addition , Gim@@ p levels will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ettes , use the input automatically for all sha@@ dows , means and solar co@@ res . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for rot@@ or , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the transfer di@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the input applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the correct image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left , half of the origin@@ als and the target image is displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically in depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to specify the channel , which is modified by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this switch , two symbols have to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . the linear mode is usually the linear mode . for images with large areas of constant colour the linear mode creates a wide beams . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cur@@ v@@ eil to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dar@@ ker stripes and the corresponding image pixel bit dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; preview the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark on the area you want to change the original value . create a point on this line , and move it up and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can make exactly that . each curve you can create , this file format is stored and later uploaded . the file format is the Gim@@ p curve format . &quot;
&quot; if you use this method and the three color buttons are automatically generated by the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and Sundays . check the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the transfer di@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that has been corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ous channel . shadow and Sundays is used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the correct ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fier ; image processing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the colour sha@@ des of the photos .
&quot; the channel mixer is a further developed tool for mixing the colour sha@@ des of images . you can edit it from the menu @-@ mixer , editing images . &quot;
you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication as you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be seen by comparison of your own rider .
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you place this in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you are able to keep the visual brightness , as the channel mixer will keep your device to generate great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to cut the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ och@@ rom@@ atic , the reduction of a colour to a visible noise , which occurs from the far@@ brau@@ schen near the same spot . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion through which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any mixer setting can store for later , and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format . &quot;
&quot; the transfer di@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel is re@@ activated . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the working image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography was always fascin@@ ated because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step because colour images can easily be converted to the calcul@@ ator . also with a set of film len@@ ders .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filters . this looks great , with all scenarios and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus , like the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange @-@ filtered : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with orange lens filters . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and air photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) orange film . &quot;
rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lenti@@ l filter . this creates dramatic A@@ scen@@ sion and can sim@@ ulate moon phases for the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ er .
&quot; yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film , with an yellow lens filters . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter . &quot;
Sep@@ i@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while he adds a little cold into the sha@@ kes . this is very similar to the process of fl@@ atter and re development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ant ; tool texture use decorative tex@@ tures to be shown on an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of it &apos;s a color picture or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stick of an old master , a pop style of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry image can be used for image processing . &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ adding of this parameter to the right increases the note of the depth or three @-@ dimensional texture of the texture on the picture .
a paper case has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and changed under ( 2 ) and changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photo is no easy task . to keep his attention to keep the picture a decorative barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under the frame you can add the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , make the desired frame type for your image . the image with a colored line , Nie@@ p@@ ce leaves it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , which is ideal for a button and decorative structure , adding a decorative frame with pattern . &quot;
&quot; width : gives the width of frame in percent . the range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; this will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of images , especially if you have used the tool for aspect ratio beforehand . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple an form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture of any spot . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use Tex@@ ts , Orientation , Color from the color space and the character set with its features like you need . you will simply take a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each attitude you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you hit the button &quot; OK &quot; . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed . &quot;
using the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; tool template uses you can insert a template on a picture .
the menu Picture Sten@@ cil use in the image processing can be used to lay templates via a picture .
&quot; for the template , there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be able to add to the file size of the template . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size . if you simply want to add an email to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ant ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ fted @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you have to set your template folder with the button base folders in the dialog . select the folder in which you select templates for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder for the sten@@ cils , a tree view , which reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder is updated to automatically the fix@@ ture of templates . &quot;
below the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button increases the picture below . it is cent@@ ered around the position of mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ inking : this button shr@@ inks the picture below . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to minim@@ ize the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move on the template under the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted , three different tools are available for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool to sharp@@ ening . it &apos;s very fast and simple , but produces especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; un@@ sharp@@ ened mask is working on the contrast of the edges look like a picture . in fact , it &apos;s not a bit more psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it is a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; focus is probably the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it &apos;s a bit more complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt . &quot;
photos without focus and most digit@@ alized pictures need an correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is why the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be printed along with a common color . this is again that the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras usually need more ar@@ able sharp@@ ening as normal cameras for private users .
&quot; at JPEG image , a camera of internal sharp@@ ening has been applied frequently . images in the raw format will always have to be pushed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can apply a sharp@@ ening filter during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this de@@ activate , you get control over your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by sharp@@ ening a photo with the sharp@@ ening case of sharp@@ ening . you can call with the menu entry to sharp@@ ening sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; you should get carefully what the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but also ampli@@ fies space . in general , the usable technique can be focused on the sharp@@ ening of a picture . in general , you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw . use the tool for the turn@@ out with the menu entry to record soft@@ ness and experim@@ enting with settings . the front page on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter in@@ sharp is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
original picture and preview help the picture edit the picture shows the issue of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values are often good results and should be tried out . an increase in the radius or contempl@@ ation increase the effect . if you create the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask to make noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius provides how many pixels are affected by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore sharp@@ est images best in its final resolution .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped picture , which is added to the original . thereby , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the well@@ being value is a split from the maximum RGB @-@ value and the default amount of the difference . you can define a minimum difference for a cann@@ ing of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the killing is excluded and hence beauti@@ full error in faces , heavens and water surface . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) and the processed image has been applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a s@@ well@@ being = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ant ; General tools Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ed a picture of improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected discharge filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool seeks a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; in which there is a better approach as only attempt to test the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . it is better to use the use of a non@@ sharp@@ est mask . Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ers can launch it from the menu by calling colors Re@@ foc@@ uss@@ ing in the image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular f@@ ission works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s f@@ ission has a very long tail , which leads far from the original qu@@ ell@@ x , which is far from the original loop pixel , which causes un@@ wanted results in most cases . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular f@@ lange . it is the most important parameters for use of this module . for most of the images , the default value should be a value of 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp but then in Heiligen@@ sch@@ an . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation is reduced to the shar@@ ehol@@ ding effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values can be reduced from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are very bad . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a suitable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is still toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you might use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of trans@@ itional size . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular balance or the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as and shop buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any reproduction parameters will be set for you , so it can be saved later and can be loaded later . &quot;
&quot; try all the conc@@ ision , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture . the reason for this is that much operations changes not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ pleasant art@@ e@@ facts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and draw pictures , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by doing a sharp m@@ asked a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically it has to be seen un@@ sharp always Ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions , it can never detect the effect of un@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can show that the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese Fil@@ ters is always at least as good as the un@@ sharp@@ est mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between the different filtering , on a small @-@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ clear colour picture has to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of sharp@@ ening correction in digital image , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the kno@@ b of the kno@@ b , the sharp@@ ness of the division of the ev@@ ap@@ orated , used to create a natural pup@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the colour tin@@ te allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want blue eyes rather than dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove any arti@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the In@@ ca Algorith@@ m was developed by the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains different default settings as starting point , to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below : &quot;
&quot; in case you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail keeping p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the conservation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass surface over the picture . a value of 0.9 should get more homogen@@ eous and more detail . please note that no sharp@@ ening is always necessary . &quot;
&quot; belt depen@@ dency alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ s evenly across all directions , while a value close to 1 is needed only in one direction . if you have a high value of similar patterns . JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts will be best found at a value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
&quot; smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum percentage factor above all . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . place this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameters affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : when often the algorithm are run through . usually it is enough 1 or 2 .
&quot; An@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : el@@ op @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is small , it should also be small for a long run@@ time . make sure to choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; step distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step distance in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel bells and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the selection of this option is only low . but he doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
&quot; the buttons save as and shop make exactly this . any setting of image errors can be stored in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
image errors is compar@@ atively very quickly at work . but it can still take a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button demol@@ ition .
&quot; below you can see how images can be corrected using small Ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analogue camera , which is caused by a poor film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the correct picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; smoke reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ lows . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
&quot; this tool provides selectable images to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ e@@ facts which come from dust or hair on the lens , it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ Effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sens@@ ing digital cameras , you can read this on English in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
the screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ft noise that can be removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you need only the sub@@ window details and the lower level settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of the filter per pixel and can be p@@ am@@ pered by the image and the color in it becomes smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front . if it is increased , noise filters will be re@@ adjusted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can &apos;t get more and noise or lubric@@ ating again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong cannot be the whole noise , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process of the details controlled by the details .
color : controls the colour tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process of the details controlled by the details .
&quot; gamma : controls the amount of the image tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark areas , which are typically stronger stronger . however , he also emb@@ ell@@ ished the shadow of shadow . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping shock . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts on variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear to appear . if it is high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . he can remove noise and is the recommended method . &quot;
&quot; store and load : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set can be stored in the file system and later . &quot;
this is an example of how to change space reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correction was used with the default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution , the image is a bit soft to draw . use the tool for the turn@@ out with the menu entry to create turn@@ out and experim@@ enting with the glass deposit . the front page on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; photo rest@@ oring is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease photographs .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s style , film grains , scrat@@ ches , compression tests and local errors that make the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and tex@@ turing . the text version is designed with a different tool , the image error correction , developed by the IM@@ AGE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ v and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss @-@ in comp@@ ul@@ sion@@ ism it produces some comp@@ ul@@ sions &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting is to correct this problem . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and shop make exactly this . every setting of photo rest@@ oring can hereby be saved , stored in a text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
photo rest@@ oring is compar@@ atively very quick at work . but it can still last long and a high CPU load after itself . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
&quot; below , you can reduce how a photo with equ@@ ating cu@@ res can be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film conditions on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct among ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures was reduced to an old color photo that was read on an old color photo that was created by scanner lighting and the photo file . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fier ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixel of photos that were to be removed with a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ stop .
&quot; light , tot@@ e or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression over a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixel .
download this file into the wi@@ z@@ ard with the kno@@ b image . the tool will recognize automatic and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; when you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark picture directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture . notice that the assistant will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result . the preview window indicates the issue of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are highlighted in all areas of sight .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filters method to inter@@ pol@@ l this pixel blocks . these are the available filters below :
Dur@@ ation : it is obtained an average of neighbouring pixel . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels represent a distance between 1 pixel block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block is pulled , to charge a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square bends ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixel in block . &quot;
&quot; Kub@@ isch : all pixels are moved with a gap of 3 or less , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in block . &quot;
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the correct picture is below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the di@@ gi@@ ance ; Vig@@ net@@ mask correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ net@@ ation , i.e. lower corners , one image . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , especially those in the medium and large photo format , can not exceed the entire sensor area not evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ or ; vig@@ or ; ( sha@@ dy ) they can reduce the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ objective also demonstrate this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it also draw@@ backs . many centre @-@ filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which should make it impossible to keep the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be used , even with Center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects arise through movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s filter and colour or grey @-@ stage transformation by digital cameras and film scanners , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a c@@ enter@@ filter , this is possible to sim@@ ulate the transformation with a c@@ enter@@ filter to an image . the tool is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction filter , and with three additional exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the level of light output absorption at the point of the biggest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is a optical filter with a bl@@ ending adjustment of 1 , or randomly a light intensity of 2 , de@@ cel@@ er@@ .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a small degree of Vig@@ net@@ um . &quot;
&quot; Leu@@ ch@@ strength , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture is reduced by the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction . you need to re@@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers represent only positive values , as you need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle re@@ adjustment of the exposure of the target image , allowing the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / gamma to zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ mask correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ orting in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct image . a leu@@ ch@@ ke@@ ke@@ - and contra@@ sting correction was also performed with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the effect of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ or@@ ations . color@@ ings can not be corrected with this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree is treating the general geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or consistent form of the image . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar circular effect , but fla@@ wed to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the rear @-@ grade degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion of second degree . with negative values , tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion may be corrected and positive values kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of dist@@ ortion fourth degree . this value appears stronger on the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameter is the inver@@ ted sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and performs a correction of first degree through negative values . negative values increase while positive the image .
light : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview of the dist@@ ortion correction . the values for your image will be saved and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
the cargo and kis@@ ses @-@ shaped correction should be carried out in front of all assignment or size changes . if you have to re @-@ cut this correction as all the first . if you are able to re @-@ form a picture and after that a tonne @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong one .
&quot; to help you make the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and a horizontal aux@@ iliary line . move it to an important place , such as the ocean wall or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in the connection , you can correct the line / kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion with the help of lines . &quot;
&quot; if you are corrected a kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion , the resulting image will be black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the menu of transformation or over the zoom controllers from this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most images , the tons @-@ shaped correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings is the perspective to correct any angle in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you are holding the camera with the hand , you always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example for the tonne @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infr@@ a @-@ infr@@ a @-@ infrared film , which is available under this URL . the filters re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters of the film grains and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . dis@@ able the option to sim@@ ulate a high sensitive film option . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film grains and the domin@@ ance of colour Green ( Chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; since filtering the filter channels to re@@ produce Infr@@ ared film , especially the green channel does not make any sense of the effect on black / white photos because the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of infr@@ a red filter image in a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated picture below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a type A@@ ura in the top condition .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Filter Film Festival is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce film grains on your images . this is known by classic high @-@ speed films like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , to increase the sensitivity of the films to enhance the manufacturer &apos;s large silver grains . &quot;
&quot; your photo effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back to the past . the treated image gets a tim@@ eless environment from daily life . in case you want to use this special , gallery file , street photography , gra@@ iny memory especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the control , the ISO sensitivity can be cali@@ br@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film @-@ set effect on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) , and that worked ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver came ; filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ons ; filter oil paintings gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . natural pictures and breast@@ feeding are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the pin size between one and five . thick brush will be better for big images . smo@@ othing , controlled by the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and that is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixel size is 1 and Gl@@ orious 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon@@ es@@ k@@ iz@@ ze . this is helpful if you imagine , which scene you would have chosen to outline what scene you might want to capture . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regulator elec@@ ts the pin size and the lower adjustment is adjusted the contrast ( glass deposit ) . &quot;
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the standard settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter engraving the picture in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; filter engraving is a fast tool to return your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , in which color does not use the most important content of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to turn the image into a grey , mon@@ stro@@ us landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth permits the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed picture ( 2 ) . the depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by dist@@ ortion effects . it is used by copyright algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; wave pattern 1 : split the image in cells , and makes it look like if it is seen by glass blocks . &quot;
wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the shaft blocks 1 the picture is dist@@ orted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects at any time with the button .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of artwork using non@@ slip effects . it is used by copyright algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom un@@ sharp@@ ness : get the image along st@@ ern@@ al lines run from a centre . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ omed camera and creates a dynamic expression of often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image by rotation of the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the sharp@@ est of a turning camera .
distances : wi@@ per the picture to create a non@@ focused camera of camera . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; motion detector : wi@@ ped the image through horizontal movements of pixel . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; turn@@ out of the soft tones : wi@@ per the picture soft in the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
archers : wi@@ ped the image by random shift of pixel and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ est of a moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : find the color in the picture and wi@@ ped them without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : split the photo in rectangular cells and then creates , by filling the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
&quot; the shelves are a nice small tool to make shelves on your image . thereby , it gives natural your images a great look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n by copyright protected algorithm . &quot;
the tropical size allows to change the size of the drops . as the stal@@ k size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease the number and density of drops . fish au@@ gen changes the optical effect of the drop in the image .
&quot; you can stop using the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; image processing a range of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter regulator , the area will remain free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the regulator . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , so you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu trans@@ forming rotating or trans@@ formers . &quot;
photo @-@ blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo at a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to minim@@ ize is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture blo@@ oming and the details can be found here ? how can you find the missing information ? how can you find the missing information ? how can one find the missing information here ? how can one find the missing information here . try him and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size , select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is below . &quot;
&quot; the tool for the size change is a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to blow up . &quot;
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation for example Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge of the image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; used a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photograph was developed by the IM@@ AGE team of G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want the size to change . these settings are available in the tab new size and are listed below :
&quot; the aspect ratio is maintained : if this setting is activated , the aspect ratio is retained at the input of the new size of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameters affects greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is needed , as it is difficult to generate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and loading are used exactly . every single @-@ setting for photo aug@@ ers can be saved as text file and re@@ charged later .
&quot; photo v@@ ases is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load after itself . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below the example of picture bub@@ bles by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard magni@@ fication comparison .
&quot; the cutting of a photo isn &apos;t just a frequently performed surgery , but also an often under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . simply type the rectangle with the mouse , through press the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you &apos;ll see this rectangle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you release the mouse button again , the field of the photos will be cut out . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo after the cutting edge . you can create the size of the way to cutting edge by taking it simply with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button of the cutting edges in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimm@@ ed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file store or file storing in the file to store the newly created photo . &quot;
&quot; in the presence area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in dialogue remains . &quot;
&quot; in the tool for aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width can be assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool for aspect ratio is used with a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal , regardless of whether you can see inches , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons are automatically adjusted to centr@@ ate horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; below the dialog you can set with the Max . ratio button to cut the range to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool for aspect ratio thus saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool , these settings are displayed as default values in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data will reflect the original image and not the original picture . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the conventi@@ ons allow assistance to be able to enable , so you can get your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third floor , harmon@@ ic triangles have a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth pattern such as spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the flo@@ ppy leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden pitch is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used for the old Egyptians and Greeks , that build up your temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you joined the pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is guided by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i episode 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 34 , 34 &amp; etc . as a result , the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows the rule is regarded as vis@@ ually harmon@@ ically . &quot;
the golden middle makes liquid aux@@ iliary lines available if you have a picture . this help is listed below :
&quot; golden Spir@@ als will get good results for your photos . in comparison to third @-@ party gel produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral , creating a symm@@ etri@@ cal visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule are called the rectangle of the golden spiral , also called golden rectangle . it should be something that the eye can be found in the heart of its composition . this can be just because of its own eye , it will be able to fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles are also from the top mentioned golden spiral . their ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the pages of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , golden triangles are not equal to these lines , a static object can be released . &quot;
&quot; if you are using golden triangles in order to break your frame , use a effect of professional photographer dynamic symm@@ etry . try to place your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information into the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t get different . &quot;
the options Horizont@@ ally flip and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ious particles .
&quot; with the button color , you can set the color of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ iliary lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of any angle .
&quot; if you do a photo then it &apos;s easy to keep the camera exactly vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture , in which things have rot@@ ated an angle . you can do this with the tool free rotation and adjust the transformation of free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . by the kno@@ b , you can reset the sl@@ ate again to 0 degrees . a preview of Rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed right above . &quot;
&quot; for your help , the free rotation provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the picture look around the two lines . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is to use the function transform@@ able cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
a more elegant way to cut the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ s the picture a bit after the turn . note , however , note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ plex@@ ical transform@@ ations are carried out at a point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be re@@ charged automatically . on the right side of the dialog , you will find some information about changing the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new wid@@ ths : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed region .
angle to the right : displays the current angle in degrees to the upper right corner of the transformed region .
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom @-@ left corner of the transformed region .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees to the bottom right @-@ right corner of the transformed region .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture becomes a bit shy . for individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a twice as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have changed the perspective , you &apos;ll get an un@@ pleasant tri@@ ang@@ ular holes on the corners . one way to cut this is the image with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and to the other part into the opposite . a horizontal shaft , i.e. , is dist@@ orted to the upper part of the picture . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module with trans@@ forming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; navigate your picture by scanning the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you are squee@@ zing at default , angle to zero is set to zero . a preview of effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right . &quot;
&quot; your help will end a vertical and a horizontal line . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the building , the image will be caught a bit . for single sampling this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ et@@ ch@@ ings are twice as much contra@@ ctual and therefore you should avoid it . &quot;
&quot; after crossing the image , the image has a beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is the image with trans@@ forming cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write . available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way such libraries comp@@ iling from . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of images formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to specify a list of all file formats available on their system . but you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F under it . &quot;
&quot; and di@@ gi@@ fted ; displays only files in formats to know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change that list of file extension refers to . in the section configuration you can find further information . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to use it even to use format . a detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data compression methods in digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to store the image data to a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better to save results as JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save loss @-@ free if it is stated in the settings .
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw material format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can find Roh@@ format images in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the raw material Converter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; in the section configuration you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ . . &quot;
&quot; and di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports the loading of raw images only by the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; we will see more than 200 raw file formats . see the table below shows a brief list of raw formats used by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ans ; supported by : &quot;
many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in the AV@@ I@@ - or MPEG format ; does not understand these formats and will therefore be able to view or edit any built @-@ in possibilities . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the &amp; K@@ DE ; settings for playing movies use to start playback .

&quot; if you can exchange the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do if the initial contrast was very good , then you can carry out the first four adjustments with the White module . &quot;
many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ver ; contain their description here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ening , soft@@ mark , rou@@ bles@@ hooting , re@@ focus , in@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview of before the filter is applied to the current picture . below you see &amp; quot ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of filters to the current picture . left of him allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the pre@@ face area . these modes are :
&quot; vertically without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter , applied on the right of the selected area of the selected area . &quot;
&quot; horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter , applied to the range below the selected range . &quot;
&quot; vertical parts . the left area shows the original , and the right to compare the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original and lower , comparison to the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; &apos; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview when the mouse is not in the presence , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that can be used to show over@@ - and under@@ cut exposure . colors used in the general installation page can be adjusted .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for a preview of Pre@@ view . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the picture , and on the part of the picture you want to see . the preview of the link will be updated instantly . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the left bottom of the lower corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all depos@@ iting from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely explained by itself . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo characteristics : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this rider is an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini@@ atures . you can then move out with the mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to move up a square . all pictures within this coordinates are filtered and displayed . this is sure that your pictures contains Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and used for use of colors .
&quot; the pall@@ ets files used by &amp; K@@ DE can be installed , either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case you can find themselves in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined color , and last user used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog range , they can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folders according to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color besides . colour is described under the Pal@@ etten@@ view . here the colour name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used too . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor . afterwards , move the mouse with pressed lin@@ ker mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box of the cur@@ sor is enabled under the button color , the colour is inserted in the cur@@ sor on cur@@ sor . the color becomes either inserted or over@@ write an others ; depending on whether the mode is selected , you can choose the check box below Bei@@ m cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ ore@@ dit ; used the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a row @-@ end character , if a further colour is followed . if the three numbers can be inserted in the cli@@ p@@ board , this can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; the colors in the palette and the output of colour selection may be drawn up with the mouse . &quot;
one color somewhere on the screen and then choose the color on the left .
&quot; graph &amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graph@@ s are used in science , particularly in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program that includes graph@@ s and X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; this project aims to replace these programs by a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of an integrated integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program .
&amp; graphic viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphic design ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all options of an integrated integrated &amp; K@@ DE ; program in a modern and user friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; Kate ; and &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graph@@ s in &amp; Kate ; the graph is calculated and written in &amp; graphic viewers ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; Kate ; to open or to open graph@@ s in &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; in a &amp; Kate ; -@@ component
download large graph ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to present more than that node )
&quot; additional required software : &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; program , which is setting up &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools and dot ; for displaying the graph . requires in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the open graph@@ s , each in its own property panel . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; without a argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen photo . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains just the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of Zul@@ u opened files . in this case , click the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower screen photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed if the graph is larger than the drawing room . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the spro@@ cket ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressing &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming in both directions are limited by a factor of 10 . see the maximum loading of a graph .
&quot; when the straight in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; uploaded file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Graph will be re@@ loaded or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; can you remember your decision later , so later you can change your decision later , you can set up the menu entry Settings ... please see , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph file outside an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; the instance can open , and eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; instance , you want to display a new &amp; k@@ graph graph@@ s in a window of the already current instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also to change the installation dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also set how the graph is to be divided on multiple sites . the number of horizontal and vertical pages may be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple sites , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be entered on a page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one on several sites distributed graph@@ s without head@@ line and with a different font
&quot; the page again shop gives the option to determine the behaviour when a file has changed on the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can define a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore any changes ) or the program for each time . &quot;
&quot; the site opening is the possibility to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; set up , when a graph will open outside of a current session . you can open a default behavior for this case ( the graph in a new window ) or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site seat administration gives the opportunity to determine the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; you can open a default behavior ( the files of the last session open or not ) , or determine if they are asked to start with each start . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose from different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorith@@ ms . the entries , as described in the website of &amp; icons ; are described , are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directed graph@@ s . it produces hier@@ arch@@ ical or sho@@ cked represent@@ ations of targeted graph@@ s . the algorithm determines the edges in the same direction ( from above or left to right ) and then tries to produce possible short edges and as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates into the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF key@@ word of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization is available to loc@@ alise images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itudes are used . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization R@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . in order to run a possible correlation with GP@@ X file , you need to download a trace file with GP@@ X file , of course , you need to download a trace file with GP@@ X file , like the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera operation must be carried out on GMT . this can be done with the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the maximum deviation for the maximum time deviation is a top deviation for the GPS period and camera power . the deviation is lower than the data , the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have any trace data from a place for images , you can edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will be cor@@ related to all images in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any matching data . if you know that reality a location in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can put these borders here and then put the button cor@@ related to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialogue . this is useful if you have made a range of photos in the same place . since the dialog box , you need to use the button OK to set the data on the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map and be placed on the map , and you &apos;ll win it again through , until you will always be selected manually . the card can always be manually switched between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside of the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool uses to have a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in an image gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages , and the parameter is encoded as HTML pages . the character set will be encoded as UTF @-@ 8 in order to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adapted . the hor@@ semen selection allows all albums to be exported to HTML . you need to select these albums , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly show a large number of albums . among them the text will appear on the right side of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely explained to create a page . if you click on a picture , a new page is displayed on the picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard picture viewer , and eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , &quot;
the Rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated images . select a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export that contains everything it will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information is stored in the new pictures as well . &quot;
&quot; with other colour depth , you can change the default color depth . the size of course also influences the file size . all other settings are explained by yourself . &quot;
&quot; the rider imag@@ ery allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the imag@@ ery pictures , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user like far the action is . press off to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program to determine if error occurred during the production . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to show the preview of the Gallery . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL bas@@ ing tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of pictures and run on them basic operations such as turning , zo@@ oming or shifts . the viewer can be used with short commands and fast access to its features . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture will be displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without blocking its quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses to quality and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is the file size , because no compres@@ sing of the color information takes place . this is where the P@@ NG format is once again . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I Module Metad@@ ata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team . &quot;
&quot; with the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image dialog box with which you want to copy the image dialog box with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data is then copied to the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function doesn &apos;t work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please check out ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a number of images into a m@@ peg video in form of a slide .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the pack@@ ets M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can create a background colour for the slide . with this module , it is possible to use the formats DVD / SV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD CD / VCD for your DVD player . to burn the media you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you need to un@@ packed the pictures taken into the m@@ peg holes . afterwards , you can launch a module by ex@@ tras m@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the pictures selected by you are listed below image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting order or content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XVI , SV@@ CD and VCD . in case you are planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ set and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the image of the image is defined below . a lower value generates very sudden , a high contrast with very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set up next . in doubt , you should set it black . the name and path of the created file can be set to you under name of the MPEG @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under name of the audio source file , this is integrated into the film . depending on the speed of your computer you can now drink the production of the film . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now drink a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages over the button on the right below . &quot;
the print assist@@ ent allows several pictures to print more pictures on a paper paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined images can also be done automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : sensible to print it or print with the Gim@@ p module .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your images stored in one of three formats : JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote by Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software is created by your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w picture @-@ converter window appears in mode for a single image . you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re@@ adjust the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings will be used for the white , and the main parameters like gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and the file name remains the same and only the extension is adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss @-@ based algorith@@ ms and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the tagged image format , T@@ IF@@ F , reserves all the information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format as it is only a limited number of operations . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you are choosing JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can start converting button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use it . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode allows you to convert different images to one time . so if you are sure , for example , through testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for single images . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the use . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple pictures of an image collection . it uses the image from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can get the image smaller or enlarged . this includes four types of image change to be provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image will automatically be selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 wires . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your image to screen format .
not proportional : propor@@ tion@@ ed size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is altered at this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the printing resolution and size of the photo printing . the target image , including back@@ size , frame size and background colour is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of sending pictures before . further pictures can draw on the list of the spread pictures and leave there . &quot;
&quot; after you have started the module , the pictures window frames can be displayed by you selected pictures . you can add more images using a file dialog . for the last selected image , you will see a preview of the right page . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the picture @-@ list and add in order to add some of the list of the list@@ ings .
&quot; with the kno@@ b , remove images from the list of selected images are removed . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message through your e @-@ mail clients with the button . you have to add the addresses and the subject to the subject . they are added to you selected pictures . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the e @-@ mails . there may be a good idea to send some mails if you want to send many pictures .
&quot; the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time , until you change it . &quot;
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail service , you &apos;ll need to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a attached file , comments are added to the images into a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format among the menu pictures file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best to have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG pictures of file format , and the original files in JPEG format , the original extern@@ ally data will be added to the difficult pictures . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be shut down automatically , so you can view the status message on the search for errors , but your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . by the button , you can shut down this window ? en . &quot;
after starting the module &apos;s Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au appears a window with questions like you want your di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album .
&quot; the Open@@ GL trans@@ itions in the presentation uses very elegant image transfers to Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide is very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures in the left corner is displayed during the presentation .
&quot; the loop allows for this to display the presentation in an endless loop , and you can go manually with Es@@ c , manually . &quot;
&quot; the images are randomly selected , that the pictures are displayed in an acci@@ dental order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; between the pictures , the time interval between the pictures can be set between the single images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should be the test before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . acci@@ dental elec@@ ts a different effect between the pictures .
&quot; during the slide , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left hand side . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom , you can see the current file names , the position of current image and the total number of pictures in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation yet . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background picture is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE work surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can find with &amp; photo album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by comparison with the picture you are available in each group , so in people , places and in group &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you will see the categories as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look after EX@@ IF @-@ based information , look at the folder structure on your hard disk and of course the current gu@@ ide@@ als . in the following is described each for itself . &quot;
&quot; if you hit the mouse to the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both people can be seen . by this selection method , you can limit the number of displayed pictures of a few thousand pictures on some single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view pictures with imag@@ ery pictures to view the images of your action . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their names . you can store with &amp; photo album ; however , for each person you can have a private appearance , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories , which you have defined . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; in order to display pictures beside the name , select the button , which you want to use right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category , which allows you to display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of key@@ word ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; you must , however , have to set the image for each individual person . to do this , you &apos;ll need to display the picture @-@ c@@ auti@@ ous window ( in closer ) and select the image for the corresponding person . in the saf@@ est window , you can select the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and therefore select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for searching for the entry in the main window , you will see a dialog showing the dialog for the set of the image properties very similar . this dialog can view you on the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you want to enter a string in the field labeled or description , you can also enter a date / descriptions of the pictures after this text . if you want , you can also use a date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the window , you can browse all pictures by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user book for &amp; photo album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather try to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and look at the free@@ way , screen photos and introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; launch &amp; photo album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; photo album ; for the first time , or select the menu in the menu for the first time , or select some example pictures and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom edge of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . see the tim@@ eline of this strip here . as the name suggests , this LEICA shows you data about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display you several different time units . each strip shows a different unit . you can change between units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the LEICA &apos;s only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be interactive on the following ways : you can select the displayed message preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is shown in the preview no@@ des ) and in addition , the tim@@ eline will always display the current date of the present pictures if you will navigate in preview mode . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , so the tim@@ eline is displayed . you can cancel the selection only by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; you can find two options available to create HTML websites with your pictures , which is integrated in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other than module available ; integrated version , which you can create over the menu HTML ... can be found . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages have to be created , you need to make some settings . these are divided into three areas : contents , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the over@@ look and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on the photo album ; HTML example page , you will see an example of this settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo album is created ; the export file should be created on the side of the review . nour@@ ish information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information is shown on the HTML page . as a result , you can avoid that information is displayed without description . for example , you can &apos;t use the pictures of a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to conce@@ al certain images of certain amount . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can set how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ation possibilities are clearly , which is why not specially received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust various resolutions for images . in this way , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 . for example , you can download a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time , you can change the resolution at any time . so he can get your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time , as well . if he has got a picture larger , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting range , place the different folder and the URL to where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best for all your HTML files , choose a base folder and for each following sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you have to select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be saved and select for all future pictures of the storage location . here you can either select a folder or a K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check this really all for viewer . if you have created a web browser , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have to copy the HTML files even in the final destination file , you need to manually copy them manually . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the just described options described are all three on base @-@ folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will set you in terms of output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; photo album ; you can , of course , you may share your pictures with these images . you can , of course , you need to add a HTML page to viewing the pictures , then you have to do with &amp; photo album ; this work will not be done once again . &quot;
with &amp; photo album ; you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file , whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if in the file , you can only add a link to the file . the advantage is that you can keep all images into the file , but the obvious dis@@ advantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the file Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file looks for a two @-@ fold mode . first of all , the images can be found in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . this is , of course , the pictures of the URL , which you have created when you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export file . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue will be described for exp@@ orting pictures you will exp@@ ire about the File File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
&quot; if you want to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic option , copy the .@@ k@@ im file via the .@@ k@@ im file and automatically copy the images to you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im -@@ files are normal Zip files . as most of the pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it &apos;s usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to compressed this option simply select the export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is Maximum image size . if you are not able to send your friends pictures , as the .@@ k@@ im file might be very large , as the .@@ k@@ im file might be very big . here you can say that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu of import@@ ing ... , it will be written &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are person@@ alised in the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a chips ) , while this category is called for your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialog and what categories are these in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of imported file with the categories of your present database . an example of this can be seen on the image . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse pictures and look : if you see pictures , you often want to see pictures of your Italy vacation &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look for example pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will take the various steps from ( 1 ) to set up the information about your pictures , through ( 2 ) the search and look for up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ table options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today also takes your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but often include videos with one . &quot;
&quot; photo &amp; photo album ; stores all his information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. nor@@ mals backup tools , copy to a disk or revisions in CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; and photo album ; remember the folder , where your pictures are stored and used this at future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to start another folder with pictures , you can start &amp; photo album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
you can download the menu entry into photo album ; enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of the user guide you will be explained to the various setup possibilities .
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call setup possibilities for viewing and the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can call a detailed help to the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you as you can create different features , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog box , which is used to process existing groups . for any existing group , you can select a labelling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete assembly groups , i.e. all members of a group in one group rather than explained in a group . &quot;
&quot; you can see the setting options available to you for the list of members . with the adjusted selection list , you can select the category you would like to configure . in the left window , you can select a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; share his module system with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image plug @-@ in interface . you can find information on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
&quot; the modules can be called via the modules . the modules can not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help page that you can call on the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules have been used together with multiple applications , it can be that the modules have been tested with the demo database before using this on your own pictures . demo database can be found either via the command line with the command &gt; Photo@@ Album -@@ Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . do not say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I together are very different , making it possible to work several modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the dis@@ advantage , when you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this type is just a folder . even if &amp; photo album , this type of order is not supported , so you can sim@@ ulate the functions with &amp; photo album . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulate &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the actual view , so all images that show you the picture gallery . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , my photo album has to be handed over ; the modules also have a list of records . here , &amp; photo album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo album &apos;s browser shows the content of a category , for example , all individuals , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category which you have defined in the dialog box as a category for virtual albums , so if you are using the category persons , so if you would have chosen people to view this view and give the module this . &quot;
&quot; some modules with &amp; photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . select the dialog dialog and select the modules , which modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see an example of a starting screen , as soon as you start &amp; photo album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you &apos;ll see the window with which you can browse through your image database . at the moment , you will see no more information about your pictures . in the section we will see you on this window , which shows you an overview of all the existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the option to see each image with notes , where the picture was taken on the picture , where the picture has been recorded either individually or for a larger number of pictures specific notes at the same time . if , for example , at all pictures Jes@@ per , and all the pictures were taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and Brow@@ se , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text field by creating persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album , since you can always use information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the shifting of the pictures inside the list : if you have a family party , and on all the 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be found , you can find that the used names are moved up to the people faster and arrange them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive a alphabetical list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes on each image separately , you might want to edit all selected images and have this pictures with notes . Click this case simply on the front and back @-@ buttons that are located below the preview of the picture right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu to use multiple entries at once with a comment . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an Excel group . to show you that it is an over@@ lay , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Comment dialog@@ s it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also add an entry to a category and take this entry to a sub@@ category this entry . attention , this assumes that you just see your categories alpha@@ be@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can shift the individual elements of the Comment dialog@@ s by p@@ adding the LEICA , click on and move the upper edge of the frame , click and move out of a frame by going out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , click on the button options ... , which offers you the option to save the current structure and the appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also want to leave a frame completely . if you want to display this window later , you can use the button options ... and then window can be seen / off . this process will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview of the current pictures , or any pictures if you don &apos;t have filters here . you can configure the size of th@@ umb@@ nails , using simple following pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; if you like a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture will appear in the picture viewer . if you don &apos;t have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture preview . simply select the corresponding pictures from which you want , and select either the removing button or select the menu Edit . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use pictures with &amp; photo album ; in the picture you can use the pictures anywhere . in the picture you can see the pictures of &amp; photo album ; if not all the pictures can be loaded on hard disk .
&quot; images in which the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for example , the pictures are present on the images 1 @-@ 9 . however , you can view the pictures of this pictures . however , you can &apos;t view this pictures with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires that you want to copy files from the folders , and you can &apos;t copy it up until now . if you would like to avoid the insert of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu Pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to stay a little more privacy , you can view the pictures that you can see for other un@@ access@@ able menu . alternatively , you can also view all images that can see your small sister , and use the menu entry to everything out of current view . &quot;
&quot; with this you have set which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to set the laptop in your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , allowing all images that you have locked once again . if you want to display the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to establish a password which must be entered for un@@ locking the pictures . to set this password , just select password in the privacy privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , you can read or delete all pictures on the hard disk and to others anyone can read the password as an un@@ encrypted text or delete it . this type of password protection is only allowed to defend the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you have all your pictures with &amp; photo album ; manage and hours over hours to describe them , of course you want to look at some point . for this reason it has a photo _ and video viewer ; this is how you can start from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . of course , it shows the picture , but additional information you have shown on the picture , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily remove them using the mouse . you can also configure which information will be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . that &apos;s how the context menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you are loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can easily switch between them and down . you can jump the keys to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and an end . these features can be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as a slide show . and then you will load a new picture after a few seconds . how often it invites you to press a new image by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and will be stopped . &quot;
a very useful capacity of viewing &amp; photo album ; if it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you use the viewer you can get in the image and get out zo@@ oming . with the mouse button you can enter a rectangle with the Min@@ us button . showing a zoom @-@ rectangle and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the item button you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the balance sheet the zo@@ oms set the zo@@ oms , so each pixel is on the screen of a pixel screen . &quot;
note that only zo@@ om@@ operations are working in videos that are in and out zo@@ oming with Plus@@ - and minus top .
&quot; with the script from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu option comments from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you consider pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the picture to mark this name . but perhaps , you may only prefer to mark the image and look more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad , while you look one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features , while you watch them . features are the letters A up to Z and you can set a characteristic that you can press the corresponding letter . in this case you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . if you are able to view all images that you can edit , print or whatever you have chosen ones . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected pictures on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and particular features can be displayed in the front view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re preview , you can simply click features to the pictures by simply select the letter for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . this case allows you to paint your photo album and paint on the picture .
&quot; the painting will not be saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can make your common @-@ old later . &quot;
&quot; in case you can see a picture on the painted floor . in order to switch the painting mode of &amp; photo album ; click on the picture paint from the context menu . simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar top on the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; to work , you have to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully rule , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; you should be read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object @-@ tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object characteristics and the object is shown in the wire views yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of an object already selected , as all objects have already chosen with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object @-@ tree , select the position at which you want to add the object and click on the symbol in the tool@@ bar or select one menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following folds menu is built , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; remove either from the menu bar under edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click on App@@ ly to adopt these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , a message with an error message is displayed . then you can click the input error correction and dis@@ card the changes with ab@@ rupt@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of your own business view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview of the scene display and a small example of the scene becomes a texture framed , even if you want a sub@@ arranged element . if you want to render a sub@@ arranged element ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture @-@ map ) , you cross local . &quot;
screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will display a small cross in the wire model exhibition . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling in the entire window . &quot;
each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of the superior object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level small or equal to the tool@@ bar chosen of the scene .
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object features are displayed on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window regulation , or if you need any other arrangement , you can easily adjust it . you can also store several window arrangements and simply change between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to create a window via or below a view , drag the sum@@ s to the upper or bottom edge of a view . a rectangle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of view . the new view is an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to arrange multiple views on each other , drag the anchor in the middle to another view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the map of the map to the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window rules are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anchor , drag the anchor on the desktop or click on the little to the left pointing to the top of the facade panel . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the box bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the menu view , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are plain , you can create them at any spot . &quot;
the current window view can store you with view of window order ... save . it will be displayed in which you can store the shut@@ down under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . version 1.0 does not support this version . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the symbol Ren@@ dering on the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry list . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s IN@@ I files . it determines the image size and quality of the ren@@ dering . if you want to add a scene in different image sizes and quality steps , you can easily add many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of up to full quality images . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the symbol The R@@ ender , in the tool@@ bar or in the view of R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; every R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any longer , but it is a name that can recognize the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the desired image . if you want to ren@@ dering only a small area of the image , select the check@@ box below and enter the image section to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination of quality , you can select the features that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the user @-@ diff@@ user features can be found in user @-@ hand@@ book &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is framed with only a beam per pixel , different mistakes can occur . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these mistakes . generally speaking images with this feature better .
&quot; when you turn off anti @-@ ali@@ asing , connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called great sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard , a adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because each pixel is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is constantly split up and adap@@ tive because each pixel is lowered by the calculated colours . &quot;
&quot; if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray has a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels are processed , both pixels will be calculated with a specific number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth of 4x4 additional points , a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be charged extra rays each pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays each pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , and the maximum depth of the records may be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is reduced to the generation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the R@@ ays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this cardboard card , you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels are calculated using POV @-@ Ray . one pixel is clear if the associated radi@@ ance are made no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import an &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry to import ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; . when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings may show a dialogue window of all messages .
&quot; if you do not support spring text in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ end . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source text file in the editor file . to import objects into the scene , simply mark the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ dering . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ RAY .
&quot; if you click on the help in the property @-@ view , &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; user documentation on the displayed object . place here the path to your document re@@ ten@@ tion and version . supports the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example al@@ tim@@ ers ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the folder , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is used in different paths of the library , the first file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire @-@ models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for control points . the second color is used for display of selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera @-@ view and in the window type characteristic .
&quot; you can adjust the object @-@ catch of points to the grid in the context menu of the wireless model views . you can set up the slide separately for shifts , sc@@ r@@ ings and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; larger values reveal a more accurate wire model and thus a better tail@@ oring for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high details , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses a extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions to projections and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time to Ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross wall , a wall is framed behind the objects . the wall is shown in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross floor , a floor below the objects is framed . the floor is shown in a chess board pattern , two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check out edge , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ dering the scenes are used . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more precise data to the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window regulations . in the section window regulations , you can create and save window regulations . &quot;
the combination of standard window regulation : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window regulation at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of prec@@ urs@@ or regulations displays all existing window regulations . you can add a new arrangement with the button , and delete a button with the button . &quot;
every window arrangement is identified by the names . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can add and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New columns , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with in@@ doors , you can view the window under the existing window , with cardboard card . view the view in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; installed , and now you want to follow with no more precise knowledge of both programs . if you may follow all the steps in this guide , you should get the ultimate but easy scene : a sphere at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following war@@ nings , before you complain about that you will only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust the camera , no rules for ren@@ dering can be applied , as a result you will get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t add light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you will only get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less , you &apos;ll see the following pre @-@ set window arrangement at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and existing symbols of tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can expect a reasonable presentation of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and their use . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tut@@ orial , you must first remove all objects from the object @-@ tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry request . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene that you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the scene . this shows you the result of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name of the camera . if they click on it , you will find the content of the view@@ points that can be found in the various parameters of the camera . in user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ RAY , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but consider that the camera in view control points can change with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the button , pressing the button , change the wire model views and the object tree immediately to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s perspective . &quot;
&quot; for example , there are many ways to create the scene for the scene . you could adjust the sample ( insert end@@ able body qu@@ ader ) and size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but that &apos;s a reverse method for resol@@ ving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler possibility . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object @-@ tree , change the name and press the button , or enter the button . in the object @-@ tree the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view now shows the plain , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you watch the object @-@ tree , you will find that you can click the entry for each new object . in this case , you can see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . select Change and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to hire its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose the object &apos;s property . you can see the name in the property language ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . you can now look like the pig@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments can only be seen in black material because you need to check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , you are able to check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the sim@@ pl@@ est way . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for no color on a qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ dering your picture with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , you are not the color . you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then select this entry twice ( you can also use it more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should already be able to run , as you can already understood the basic work mode of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately modify the settings . set the value for the radius : in 1 ( do not forget the button on the floor ) , so the ball would have shi@@ fted above the floor as you moved the ground to bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as already before , the ball surface appears like a m@@ ould black material . put a suitable material in the following step . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . as at the bottom , enter the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; choose a sub@@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on ball pig@@ ment , then select insert and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take time to introduce some finish properties : &quot;
change the values as in the following screen photos and click on App@@ ly or press the inputs .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already yiel@@ ded some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should have a good impression of it now , which features you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned this much , which you can create simple , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional scene of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you make a scene ra@@ cer , the Ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of view ( i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources will work out in the scene and how atmospheric effects are processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a light source , you see also nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene needs to be controlled , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest record in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
re@@ stores the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since the last storage .
you can only select this menu entry only if you haven &apos;t yet stored any changes in the scene .
&quot; repeat the last rec@@ ir@@ reversible command . this menu entry is only then select , if you are used to re@@ use . &quot;
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog in which you enter a name for a new arrangement or write a existing arrangement .
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for setting up &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; here , you can change the appearance , the keyboard and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to change the keyboard version . you can modify this option , pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; add orders or new . &quot;
opens a dialog to set up tool@@ bars . you can add and remove a dialog box for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er .
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is an option to provide rough surfaces without any b@@ eu@@ le on the surface individually , and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geomet@@ rical forms which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
&quot; texture map is a possibility to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using an image file as color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ on show , is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can choose images to display . &quot;
pictures can either be displayed in your own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
use &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return Return .
&quot; you can adjust whether each image will appear in your own window , or if all images are always using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first sign of fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file is highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness ; there are five boxes cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can adjust the work mode of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness for the browser window . in the two others , short commands for the display window can be set for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are open in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background colour that you can continue below . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , invites &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still choose the current picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off ; when you open the name of the last open folder . the next start opens &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; Click on the coloured beams to select a background colour . in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is switched on to the full screen . &quot;
determine if the sli@@ deshow starts with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the interval between image changes on a sli@@ deshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repet@@ itions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show is repeated as long as it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can use a new value to the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the key@@ note for the various operating modes by &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off ; in the cardboard box for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the two @-@ part file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the fil@@ esystem with folders and files in one window . &quot;
displays large symbols for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
displays th@@ umb@@ nails for files in the folder . this ad is only possible in short description .
reduced the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increased the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ off ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo work based on the &amp; di@@ gi@@ stic ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; project .
photo &amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to watch your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .

&quot; and show photo ; makes it as simple as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are using the program , your browser does a link to reports about problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community that is supported by a community . if you are looking to create a more common users of &amp; show photo ; then you would like to answer any other users of &amp; show photo . in this mail@@ ing@@ list there will be English spoken and you should be in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate is the developer mailing list . guide to join the developers &apos; mailing list of &amp; entertainment photo ; .
&quot; show photo ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . in order to access this settings , you &apos;ll need to set up in the menu settings show photo . you can exchange between these settings by changing on the icons of the left . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the lower or over@@ exposure di@@ ator has been selected . sk@@ ill@@ ers should display the colours with what you shall show , in contrast , a bright color and over@@ load exposure should indicate a dark colour . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show photo ; owns a side@@ bar on the right edge which provides you important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also view this page in which you can click on one of the five riders :
&quot; ag@@ an@@ ite ; if an application for sc@@ ans @-@ scan of images , which no more makes images too sc@@ ans and fl@@ atter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the pictures can also open a dialog to store and save images in a specified folder , and save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the pictures before the shut@@ down . &quot;
you can review the status of your scanner on the san@@ e project page by review the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / C@@ GI @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; an@@ ite ; with the command &quot; &quot; l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in Terminal . if this scanner is not opened , a dialog for selecting the scanner is open . &quot;
the user can select the usable scanner and press OK to open the scanner and end it .
further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Each lib@@ ks@@ ane ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options do not treat these options .
&quot; in order to create a picture , the user can only start a preview can then start scanning for the final scan . the preview can be started out by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , user can zoom in the picture and out of the current selection out . it can adjust the zoom as well that the complete preview can fit into the window . &quot;
when the picture was chosen then the final image can be read in the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview of view into the settings , the picture will be displayed as below , the picture will be displayed as below . when saving is pressed , then the image is stored and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you will get into the main window . &quot;
by the button settings the same named dialog is opened before the main window . you can change the main settings here .
&quot; the user can see the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option should be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of the user is not desired , the option must be rejected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way of how to select . dialog to save for each image , open the dialog for each image , open the dialog before each single @-@ sc@@ anned image . if &amp; an@@ ite ; this automatically opens with a generated file in a previously defined folder , then you will need to store without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures are stored in the store , if the pictures are stored for each scan , then this folder will be used as standard for storing dialogue . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter is defined by an image pre@@ fix for automatically to save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in the dialog . automatically , the string gets uploaded a numer@@ ical view@@ fin@@ ix of every time when a picture is stored . &quot;
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize to store image quality . this value changes the compression value . if select the image quality , the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the button help starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; an@@ ite ; manual . the button on the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; enter . &quot;
&quot; under the GP@@ L license and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , which is used by &amp; Asc@@ an@@ ite , is under the GP@@ L under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs CTR@@ zel . below you can set a list of these cuts and select their function . select the list of button button in the Player window , click on and select the right mouse button in the Player window and select &quot; &quot; button &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
you may be able to set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; therefore make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP function of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; in addition Amar@@ ok still has some own command@@ ing options .
&quot; if the user can not run a feedback , if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are available and use a dialog to allow users to use a script why a script will not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &quot; Cor@@ rec@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Error error = &apos; Cor@@ rec@@ y for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; &apos; dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder scripts and templates , you can find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can quickly find it as base for your own scripts or simply add the necessary functions . they will quickly determine that the writing of scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ COP you can exchange your scripts with Amar@@ il@@ o.@@ c . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be attached to each K@@ DE installation .
most scripts themselves allow the run of external programs and commands . this is usually the function ex@@ ec ( ) used . this way can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . in this reason , scripts will respond to the default setting of the script . for this reason , scripts should ignore their standard input accordingly . of course , a script should ignore the events if there is no use of it . &quot;
configure . configure the script to display the setup dialog . to store the store data each script itself must take care of any script itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the working folder to the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ Change indicates that a new piece is played , the script might now ask &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information about the new piece ( for example , the met@@ ad@@ ata or the piece ) . &quot;
the change volume is sign@@ alized a change in volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ iz@@ u@@ Cli@@ cker : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title : contains the path to the selected files of the play@@ list , when a user defined menu entry can also apply . to remove one entry to remove d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script , e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ; finished , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do . for example , store data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ its script management can also install script packages , which can be comp@@ uted by a web server . such packages are also be compressed using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as the Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the expanded amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should use your script packages right correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can go up to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Viking scripts page of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok ; you can easily move music to the play@@ list , instead of going through endless menus . maybe you &apos;ll also look for a quite certain title for thousands of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; it &apos;s collecting browser and quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can you never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists are still difficult for you . and if the decision is still difficult to select the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically , select the right music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , you can listen to your music as you want to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; typically , one must enter the following file folder in the base folder , to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok to comp@@ ile and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto conf@@ ection@@ ate and autom@@ ake , you should have any trouble when comp@@ iling any difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report this in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mail@@ ings list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; like most applications , you can enable or dis@@ able most applications that can be able to activate the compilation @-@ time with the configure script . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details will find in the section system requirements . &quot;
activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should be full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be addressed without trouble via the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several boxes of flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; in addition to the play@@ list window , the player window appears in addition to play@@ list , and if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window is shown . &quot;
apply senti@@ ment barometer : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this option sh@@ uts the experimental function of the mood @-@ pin .
&quot; respon@@ ding to design : this function is only available when &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this function is changed for m@@ ood@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; files at the music files : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files at the storage location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files in the settings file of &amp; amar@@ ok will be stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / iPhone / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser is needed by &amp; amar@@ ok ; if a browser is needed .
&quot; other brows@@ ers use : here , you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; play@@ list , when you save , store the current play@@ list automatically when you want to lose &amp; amar@@ ok ; dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running play@@ list when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory of the play@@ list , otherwise use the absolute position of music files . &quot;
&quot; current pieces will hold visible , that the play@@ lists window will hold / off , in order to keep the play@@ lists always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when converting to context @-@ browser , automatically displays the context @-@ brows@@ ing , as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the section , you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can adjust the use of different writings in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select scripts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player window and context @-@ browser . press on selecting ... , so you can select a select font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined color scheme , you have chosen the Qu@@ al of choice and can design@@ ate your own colour scheme . in addition , use the above color chosen for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; play at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback will automatically continue with the piece on the spot , with which it stopped at the last time . &quot;
&quot; the lower @-@ screen on @-@ screen display allows you to install an O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all the settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from the dialog box to select the desired font to the O@@ SD . the check box sha@@ des that the text in the O@@ SD is displayed .
&quot; you use your own colors to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color surfaces opens the dialog for colour selection . if desired colors , use the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE is used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by adding plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the screen is intended for X@@ in@@ ama user . thus you can set to appear on which screen will appear on a multi @-@ way monitor environment .
the map Audio Edition lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers still enable additional adjustment possibilities in this cardboard card .
the map collection is used for setting up all the settings for your collection . that includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to select music files . in order to include a folder to the collection , check the check@@ box in addition to its name . this section also contains check@@ box as well as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folder as well : this causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; as well as their sub@@ folders , as well as their sub@@ folder . &quot;
monitoring changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders ( for example if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import and import : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists .
&quot; the collection of the collections database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another device is needed in the sub@@ category MySQL . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL facility is used to establish the database for &amp; amar@@ ok . under calcul@@ ator : the computer database is entered , where the MySQL database is entered , which is accessible under the database . name : is the database name , which the connection is established . &quot;
use U@@ ser@@ name : and password : to enter the data set for the link to the database .
&quot; the boxes last@@ .@@ f@@ m as@@ cri@@ be the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transfer the names of played tracks to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server , and create sound recommendations regarding the current piece of music . &quot;
&quot; here , enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can record one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send par@@ r@@ able pieces and updating the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; , the names of the played tunes to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
&quot; similar interpre@@ ters : after activ@@ ating this setting , &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ts to each of each piece played , you can see the list in the context @-@ brows@@ ing browser . note : you need not need a loaded profile to use this feature . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . you will find more information in summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
am@@ aro@@ K requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs contained ) as &amp; amar@@ ok ; you need some of them to be compiled as you k@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD is predi@@ cting that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , but it will work difficulties , but Flu@@ x@@ box will prepare difficulties , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library for days . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you can also app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly this is that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file system crashing . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a little more sophisticated .
&quot; ensure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok libraries were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then it leads to crash when working the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able your machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be solved . &quot;
&quot; this is the fact that many program write data as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but it does not character@@ ize as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : Mp@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; error when writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repet@@ ition / dynamic play@@ list ) are always enabled . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can fix the status disabled on grey and semi transparent . please note that in some cases up to three times you need to click on a symbol until this setting has its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ lock symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map and then please check if am@@ aro@@ K is the correct Q@@ t library . this can be found with ld@@ d &apos;@@ Ar@@ amar@@ ok@@ app . _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T .
&quot; to fix this error , you may remove any col@@ li@@ dict@@ ating Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to custom@@ ize that am@@ aro@@ K finds the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are some possibilities . most installation problems clari@@ fy the easiest by the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also look for help with other users or the developers , use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok . &quot;
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you want something to change an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
it is simple . use the file browser on your left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the Start @-@ Sub@@ window was converted into the statistic window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
&quot; the importance of this symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are calculated by users , while the points are calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate pieces , must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the list of the play@@ list , and select column display . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press the button on your keyboard . or click on your selection and then select from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file with the mouse to the play@@ list , and let it fall there , just as you would like to make it with other files . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right beside the button button , click the button play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably the program X@@ M@@ MS config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install the package X@@ M@@ MS de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; this package includes many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations .
&quot; the Equali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you will find it via the menu bar under ex@@ tras Equali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; used to be used by the back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question is provided with G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; you may ! maybe use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default doesn &apos;t use MP3 decoder ( for patented reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , &quot;
&quot; start the Ya@@ ST online update , and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - ) &quot;
&quot; if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink device , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use and simultaneously audio ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you search for the problem of problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ ets , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . do not forget that media must first be de@@ coded . you can only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice if you like a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data initially . G@@ stre@@ amer can display directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control centre sound &amp; multimedia sound system . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real time pri@@ or@@ ity ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper is set to : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs which can cause playback . read this bug report . the En@@ large sound buffer file in your AL@@ SA @-@ setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; presumably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer at the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less contracts react , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the g@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok off . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . lead you register to register all the g@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stra@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( exit am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store you download files , re@@ comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module file via G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module file with follow @-@ config / g@@ stra@@ amer config ) and lead you register _ amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report this under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / requirements you send them to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ COP this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and leave the alarm with this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; amar@@ ok ; play back . make sure &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will be awak@@ ened by the gentle tones of music you will stop before bed@@ time .
how to know the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; running title if you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you Inter@@ pre@@ t and Title of the ongoing unit : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA , re@@ usable us@@ ab@@ ok player now@@ days now@@ days &quot;
&quot; replace IP address with your IP , and your us@@ ername with your user name . this assumes that your identification is present in the ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA file . &quot;
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; amar@@ ok window . press it on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size @-@ changing window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights mouse represents a piece in the queu@@ es in the queu@@ es . by pressing the button on a search in the play@@ list the first search result is played and the search was reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; to select the browser window , click on the Title menu . in the context menu , you can select which brows@@ ers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on an NFS drive . after the launch of am@@ aro@@ K , the collection database can not be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ? &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok does not work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use am@@ aro@@ &apos;s MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . to normal reading , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ quer@@ or window . instead , use files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically this fits the previous evaluation with a decreasing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence has the overall rating on the overall score . &quot;
&quot; you can click the evaluation for a piece of yourself by clicking with the right mouse button in the play@@ list window . here , you can click the evaluation of a piece of button on the piece and edit : evaluation or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation of the met@@ ad@@ ata again in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want to publish it , when you should publish a stable version of am@@ aro@@ K . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed publishing plan for which to put together with the short @-@ term plan of am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
this is a new function in am@@ aro@@ K that some users can easily find annoying . dis@@ able the option icon when playing anim@@ ating in general settings .
the analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings of tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install this then under am@@ aro@@ K ... appearance context context @-@ browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ e@@ quest@@ .com ) logo . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ quer@@ or navigation area allows you to monitor monitoring and control of &amp; amar@@ ok . , while you click Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation range . then click on the button settings ( the top ) and then select &quot; &quot; Add amar@@ ok &quot; &quot; button . &quot;
Audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler is a free service to the information which are played on an independent server . the service is free and you need only one free us@@ ername and password . audio cro@@ b@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version of AL@@ SA . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of ab@@ aster and thus also caused a lot of error reports . &quot;
&quot; presumably , &amp; amar@@ ok was compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine does not compiled these output modules . you need to configure and install it . &quot;

&quot; opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create a CD on another medium without project file . alternatively , you can also want to burn only a CD instead of normal copying . you should also want to copy them if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also be able to burn a DVD to another medium . alternatively , the target medium is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record all the entire ( video ) data of the source media in the original form . &quot;
open a CD @-@ RW dialog . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
&quot; opens the dialog for the format of a DVD . with this dialogue , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) which allows the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to write the choice between the writing modes and incre@@ ment@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; it bur@@ ns a previously created CD image . the dialog is asking for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can immediately be burned by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not supported yet , but do not need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; bur@@ ns a previously presented DVD image . the dialog is asking for a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD video can be converted . thereby , this dialogue window will normally be used . this dialogue window appears normally after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used separately . it contains information about changing video , coding settings and even possibilities for changing black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is presented in the content view and include properties of media , such as size and title @-@ length of CD or DVD . &quot;
displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . when an entry is crossed is the tool@@ bar currently visible in the main window .
&quot; if this is crossed , a small bust is displayed at the bottom edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view on or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and CD / DVD drives . if the contents were activated , their contents will be displayed in the contents of the content . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and un@@ lock of the drive or use of the media . &quot;
to@@ g@@ gles the content view on or off . the content view allows the selecting and draw files to the projec@@ tors . the content view is also selected to read audio or video CDs when a drive with a CD / DVD player was selected in the folder view .
&quot; the copy is on the projection screen or off . the copy is a nar@@ ro@@ wer area that is only visible when the projection screen has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the projection view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens up a dialogue window to change the key regulations for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the key order to it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; installation assist@@ ants . this allows the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you will need to enter system administrator rights , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . here you can work with general programming settings . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b . should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and the fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; it is , like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shut@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or that is a bit more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functional scope , therefore , it &apos;s more your taste and the kind of task that is crucial for you . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions must be sure to make sure &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have all &amp; K@@ DE ; program supports and k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts are described below .
&quot; the standard D@@ COP @-@ interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b features functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;

&amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; read it for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it can be read and stored in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible depending on the Encoder which is installed on the computer .
&amp; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and many co @-@ files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) are currently supported for O@@ G@@ Gs and F@@ LA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . more Ko@@ di@@ erer can be added to the program ( if installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as los@@ s@@ free F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , the reading of the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; audi@@ o@@ deficiency ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ vor@@ bis ( for OGG ) or other Ko@@ di@@ erer have already been installed . however , all these programs are not necessary to comp@@ ile something else . however , if F@@ LA@@ C is not necessary , its installation is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; which coding / file format should be used ? chapter Which Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction of co@@ ders , audio quality and compres@@ sors factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying the protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ze ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not possible to avoid a protected audio CD ; not simply avoid the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy protection audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while keeping the setup only once to be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , it will be explained to the hard drive to read a &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to the slim approach of user interface , which you frequently stum@@ bled at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ erer programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
can &amp; CD ; get information from Free@@ DB from the Internet or can work fully without a network where everything is captured manually .
&quot; this is only a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step for example , further information is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ DB request for the CD data is set accordingly to the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case , must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts out and - if a Encoder has been configured in the coding Settings tab . encoding the encoding process .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder , so that the option can be read with a different encoder than the standard . it may be noted that previously the encoder in the code setting was configured in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager so that a already selected file is selected to code , instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
open the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for programming events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ze ; with various flash@@ cards ( such as Encoder , to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , codi@@ fication and compression rates and helps you choose the right Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is going to be lost , a non @-@ loss audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , however , the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ nt so &apos; free , lame is supplied with most distri@@ butions of free , but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high to very high quality sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bit@@ rates . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one computer or computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are present .
&quot; MP3 - When music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special car stereo system . today - initially in 2009 - support these devices usually only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and product compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Standard &apos; = This attitude should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of tit@@ els . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . well enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of titles . good enough for music by adolescents , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ os@@ ities . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting is exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , manually entered or by the program automatically entered from Free@@ DB by the program , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can deliver / used to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with Ko@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add &amp; CD ; titles can be added to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s will be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt from lame and the title can be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ gens ; parameters that can be needed ( = button names in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ DB is : a free database , which can read the information up / enter the information you can go up to the machine , so that all other information can be downloaded in the machine . it &apos;s too aware that all other information can be explained in the machine : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces , etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( it is meant by the author ) I am not attorney . however , no one can prevent the information publicly available on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , any information can be added to the music business . all the information can be done on a bum@@ ble by a &amp; CD ; business , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ze , is active to choose a check box ( S@@ end of an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems that the E @-@ mail address is not used for retri@@ eving the data from server ( but this can only know the programmer that has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audi@@ o@@ ze ; used by Free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographic will be used on the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth on the network and compar@@ es the load between the machines . &quot;
&quot; a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database . &quot;
which reading program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; it is rum@@ ors that with cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know it , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CDs ; see that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution needs to be installed , if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to store the stored WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and so the desired file format can be selected . in the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compres@@ sing for audio data ) can be added to the tab for co @-@ operation of the code . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the co@@ ders can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information on Ko@@ di@@ erer is located in the Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter . &quot;
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ers , more information about his switch can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the device @-@ designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and read files on your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) , try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a hint on what is wrong . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step . even if you use other settings , this will give advice as you need to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood but are somehow still uns@@ afe what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to establish the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time and read all our first &amp; CD ; we will use lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to use MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as a compiled package for your Linux distribution , as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section deals with basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ gens ; , something which probably will be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for any extension &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the use of co@@ ders for compression of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) , where the structure is used . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change this settings at any time , we will probably not be able to change it at any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device number is presented to the les@@ bian program that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom a symbolic link to the real device number of your drive . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is possible , a look at the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt at entries of the device names for the CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the map of General Settings . here you can &apos;t do a lot to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will leave / entered as shown in screen photo . &quot;
&quot; if you want to ask information about un@@ complete information , so you will be informed if you are missing to testify of key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the cart@@ on CD ; settings . just select both entries . we are comfortable and can be downloaded and release the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a Free@@ DB calcul@@ ator .
note : the machine must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; with the Internet to access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection box is simple , is an &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the directory entry or date entries , they can be easily changed . the directory or fil@@ en@@ ame is changed and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , then dis@@ able the selection fields and Free@@ DB can not be used . however , this is about 620 MB large , if you are able to use the database before . for Free@@ DB must be selected , at least the first selection fields will be selected at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the Internet . how does the system know which data will be displayed ? read the section about Free@@ DB . do everything as shown in screen photo . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the website fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and look at a mirror server in your vicinity . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many Fire@@ walls uses the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , there is perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings of screen photo . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number of permissible pieces : sorry , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author knows not , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; to read out of the last piece : cross it around the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial .
&quot; user defined file for temporary files : if you check this button , then the file / folder may be stored in which the WAV files can be saved , if only place on another drive , the files are not checked in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder when you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; just enter everything as it is on the screen photo . the command is a bit long , under circumstances must be sc@@ aled down to the right , to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is on average approximately 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of output tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ er for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of entry ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
reset the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of encoded WAV files : in case of dual core or square or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ gens ; this configuration is used as default for each reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files , as we want to pick up MP3 files , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section has to be repeated for any exclusion &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we include a &amp; CD ; which is not included in Free@@ DB , the screen photos will see a little different than that for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; they will be able to capture the &amp; CD , instead of sending them out of the Internet . comments are shown to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; now if this is not done , now the &amp; CD ; in the drive , which has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and its length should be listed in the window , as in screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be read and be read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this happens , then search for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully recovered from the Free@@ DB , all the tracks are already filled and also the name of the artist and the album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in case that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check@@ box for automatic query from Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also solve this by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t get any local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
E 1.2 Step 02 : CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD , according to the pattern on the screen photo . the title of the play in the first line of the &quot; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data on the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the input field &apos; news title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ ure@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply for all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after successful reading of the data from Free@@ DB is the CD Editor not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor , so that you are not only happy with the artist and album names ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited the length of the fields on 30 characters for the commentary , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary sector . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least at the tab &quot; tab . &quot; this option will take a look at the Settings menu . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with him you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all co@@ dic@@ als or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ erer , in order to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select one entry , obviously with the style of the extension CD ; this example is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors appears again and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album is already filled with the selected data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece . the title of the piece is definitely and other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed to the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the play list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of each piece . only the titles are selected , the selection of the piece is selected or out . make sure that all the pieces will select the button on the bottom edge of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; the reading process was started by clicking on the button . read the reading process , this window appears to confirm . on OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
Click on the tab to switch on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is read on the hard drive . the status of the program will be displayed in the left bottom part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will be seen if you are trying to work with a co@@ di@@ erer you have not yet installed . pieces that were not successfully coded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the appearance of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into format MP3 . so check out and code in parallel . please note the status tab in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing which seems configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes is un@@ clear . the machine used with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpre@@ t and code ( of however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is coded , and a third order in the queu@@ e of the Ko@@ di@@ ers . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ gens ; , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. and 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the Ko@@ di@@ erer of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are already familiar with CV@@ S by using CV@@ S . most distri@@ butions , however , can be downloaded an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already a compiled copy . if you &apos;re reading this package , you probably have done this package . if you &apos;re reading this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons , compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for help as the program can be adapted for your needs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . at the best you can read the step for step by the options and settings . it shows images of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first time of the program it was cli@@ cked off from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? if you read this , probably the program has started . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot add this manual . it is as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ we , may it do . at least after contact with the author , and if you want to read this section and is therefore agreed with this suggest@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; strange when you managed to get the source file from the &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , he did not have some characteristics , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus should work on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ asound project driver , which is supported for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included , as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
&quot; graphic presentation of each MIDI channel of each MIDI channel , by selecting the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard . &quot;
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows to move onto K@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( cou@@ ches or tex@@ tures ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedures used .
&quot; seat support . if you end &amp; K@@ DE , while playing a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears to select the usual file dialog , with which you can choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also find a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window can be done . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and enter the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to play out of the menu or enter the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts , as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then play after each other . ) &quot;
&quot; as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump on any spot by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the speed display and to change the recording speed again . in order to get the original speed , double @-@ click on the temp@@ o LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry in the menu , thus interru@@ pts the playback . use the spaces while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
song tex@@ tures can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use tex@@ tures , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces do not have a text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will be determined , so you can manually set any song manually , so you &apos;ll have the option to change this . if you still have the option to change this , if you want to see the other kind of file . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select from the menu settings the entries of tex@@ tures or rec@@ asts . the same function also have buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these will be played by the series . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to lay a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find in the menu Collection under the point . Click here on New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the desired position in the collection Manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
when leaving the application this collection will not be saved . remember if you add many pieces .
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection Manager . there you can add a song to add a song . it appears again the file dialog , with whose help you select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation to the collection .
&quot; when automation is activated for the collection , a piece of opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) will be automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is not activated , the temporarily the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection Manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence after from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu , the order will be specified . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection Manager or use the selection list on the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the Next song , the entry next song from the menu or press the key arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump to the reverse a song , select the button ahead of the menu , or press the key arrow on the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button delete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this doesn &apos;t matter because it is not stored at leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thesizer that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events in events that understands syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all the events of the Chang@@ patch program into B@@ right piano in events of the Type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should be playing . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment , and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite se@@ dit@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI map is a text file , which stores all the necessary settings for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . pre@@ condition for this is that every occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so I can come in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard . the general use is as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of equal sign will be ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and do not change the line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is needed to lay all the tones that requires this instrument to take on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard have no tissues ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can remove a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 ( Gun &apos;s ri@@ cher ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that this is meant by the term Tro@@ drum @-@ Patch of the Patch , in which every tone represents a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not such , at which the sound means the sound height of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to provide as sounds on a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; like the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
&quot; for each channel , you can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument will have to use different names in the first line . &quot;
Key@@ maps are mainly used to form sound on the per@@ k@@ . channel . look for example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels on others . if you want to exchange the first and second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , depending on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will continue to be defined in the file . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be used to change the patch on this channel . in this case , the patch is still used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example , to always use the Per@@ k@@ v Patch on the Per@@ k@@ v channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio can be multiplied , in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events will be multiplied . if so , a MIDI file will be converted to the value of n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then it will be re@@ directed to the map n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , thus in the map file no dec@@ imal number . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM pre@@ dict@@ ates that a keyboard , which is to play a keyboard , with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a sound higher . unfortunately , try to find some keyboards up to an oct@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . in the menu , you can find below settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the canal view is a window with a whole number of piano atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . you can see what sounds just played .
&quot; you can also use the can@@ al@@ an view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the canal view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played tones . view in the Settings menu , select the Settings menu : settings &quot;
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , which is played by a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . so if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down the pace , use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . , thus , the same MIDI file may lead to very different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can not force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the single instruments , speed and etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , De@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid . that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without any AW@@ E support , you need to download a source code and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; before , check out the check@@ box to the collection before . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can add the arrow key left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o to the LCD .
I have an &amp; K@@ DE ; work area an &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this working area ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or used ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file or change the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly , without adding them to a collection , switch the automation to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; we assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ l . only do you want to play the first file . so check the setting of automation to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ l your temporary collection , then exactly this is a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then , join me , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or the postcard , I animated it further to &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to give me a bit of time . as hob@@ bies I &apos;ve got program , MIDI files , music and pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you simply want to make me happy , write an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a great pleasure when you send me a postcard from your home or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . I &apos;ll be able to send a postcard or a MIDI file , but you should contact me when I might contact a MIDI file , but I might have to contact me since I might have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and I don &apos;t want to get it out of my spare time because / when I receive feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the bug that the sound height at AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also applies Jose L@@ us Sanchez for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Garcia for testing the AW@@ E support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ rs , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a supporting e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians in the net that give us this wonderful Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this can be found &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ pink / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can find the development on the web page with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or external syn@@ thesizer as the sound quality is essential by your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ress &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it runs as if you could not hear a sound card except that of course you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , please contact one of the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists or send an error alert directly to me . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to playback DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view , and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to make the preferred connection under the menu book@@ marks , but these are single entries . if you would like to create a list of entries that will be played by each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to obtain an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ stage . if you copied a record , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the printed entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed by direct edit the XML configur@@ ations files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category click on the menu . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content is displayed this part . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when working mode is leaving or another group will be selected without using the play@@ list .
&quot; following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during the starting and end can be disabled through the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ gam@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ verse option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / x@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . this format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during the starting needs does not need short , it will be terminated automatically by opening a different source . this would be distur@@ bing at the end @-@ animation , but the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of an start animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; ; in the source package / several examples of S@@ MIL which are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; they are supported .
&quot; there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ players in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here &apos;s the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this return device in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . everything must be configured through manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; multi@@ player , and can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in the play@@ list XML . &quot;
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash flash in setting up file states of K@@ DE must be specified . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is available in a consoles for application and to search error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a given back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also determined ) , it must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ o will play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play of TV maps , either by using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be configured , the scanner can be configured from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player can use the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ( eg , it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contain a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; as the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of recording of video equipment under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux must be supported for the X server in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , these sources are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of the emergence of these documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , source source , source source , inner source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; are there indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive , if I play from him ( not from the VCD : / / ) ? &quot;
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is to execute root as root following the device . it is absolutely secure to make / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional font application . under Unix @-@ like systems are probably used on the package &amp; tex@@ as ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; lin@@ ux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions will be taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation would be required , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; website . &quot;
questions about or at the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions requested that this should be addressed to the mailing list of k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; operating area . &amp; k@@ ile ; the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and conversion tools for this . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and his possibilities should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can begin there directly with reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH is the right language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . if it is difficult to use , a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Mak@@ ros may also use a few challenging but more realistic nar@@ r@@ ative that is , from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if there is only a good reference to &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to do it . if H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 &quot;
&quot; the same as other examples include &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction , containing the gener@@ alized properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text gra@@ zing with text . the introduction , begins with the command \ \ 1 { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ for { document } . &quot;
the high @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a good function for the quick preparation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the choice of assist@@ ants ( menu ) offers some people for creating the document . there may also be some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this is hereby defined by the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , book &#91; letter &#93; , text ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , text ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , text ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ t@@ pr@@ t &#93; , presentations &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : this will be set to the code definition . modern systems use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . you should use UTF @-@ 8 encoding ( for the correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the most used additional pack@@ ets for lat@@ ex ; for the integration , they may only be selected in the check@@ box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document categories of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( in compliance with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users can now worry about . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source text editors - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , there is a simple problem to help you that any mathematical environment is not yet closed . however , it will save you by the humble space of the output file . however , it will save you by the emphasis of time and more . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic application of environments , for entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ 1 { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically creates a space line ( for input of the text ) and the additional line to connect the command ( e.g. \ \ by { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; La@@ Te@@ X commands can be disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encour@@ ages the sub@@ division of the document in the following elements ( part is the most convenient and sub@@ lime element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements are changed through a single click on the respective and viewed . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be found very helpful . once a DVI ; file &#91; framed file &#93; , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through a click with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ panel on the corresponding line at &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file shows a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and other information such as font and is also available in addition to PDF , converting and print out of DVI ; -@@ files for various systems and tann@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; when using the slide @-@ search , the elements of the DVI ; file is cli@@ cked with the editor PFT and once upon an item in the DVI ; -@@ file , the exact opposite is the exact opposite . once upon a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was cli@@ cked on the appropriate section in DVI ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
&quot; Master @-@ Document : this function will be used with multiple files . using a Master @-@ document , work will be simplified using other in@@ tied .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document may be configured in project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
&quot; file extension : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on the top @-@ level , no . no . it is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick installation . &quot;
&quot; for viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ site selection fields should be developed . the selection fields were designed for quick installation of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the rapid breakdown of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... &quot;
&quot; the selection box for further information is available for items such as keywords , fu@@ cking notes , notes , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , image or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection on a selection box ) .
&quot; using quot@@ ation , a selection list with literary entries are displayed . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x . files are necessary only if the file is necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last run box with the name Gr@@ Ã © e is used for the set of let@@ tering heat . it is possible to set the font number for the main text , the fu@@ eled notes , etc . , there are the following letters : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile , two sel@@ ective wel@@ ds are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document is written by selecting the document and locking of the settings . 2 . document may be written down by the hand . &quot;
&quot; the stap@@ les according to the command \ \ &apos; class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also happen in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has to be entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to this is the use of Min@@ d or the button . &quot;
the source code must be saved before the comp@@ ile . &amp; k@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , the protocol should be sought after errors . if you use quick installation , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an area ( English ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font icon is supposed to have a different font . the order \ \ lesson { 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the public transport will only be noti@@ fied within the area ( from \ \ to { 3 \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ ( Number ) .
&quot; there are many people to discover the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain font cards , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . may be added to the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ lesson { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is long as long as he is closed until he is closed with a \ \ in { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ lesson { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ end { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; as shown , now a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for the creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; . &quot;
&quot; once in the wi@@ z@@ ard entered a little text , some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be served . this should be a quote , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure and a poem to use to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor or C@@ tr@@ l E ( when internal viewer ) can be returned to an external viewer . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI @-@ file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a framed file format ( English , D e V ice I n@@ v ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for reading the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi edition such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer monitors . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , you can print the document correctly ( if the printer is properly set ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; file into other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code was created , the conversion can be introduced into tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; search for the search , direct jump from the editor to the open position within the DVI @-@ file . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; bin@@ aries . this must be merely a modern under settings K@@ ile setup ... tools .
&quot; to check out the search engine , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source codes and close on prior search : the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; - viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular@@ line ; will display the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; typ@@ ing &amp; k@@ ile ; open and to the respective line spec@@ ulations . to do &amp; k@@ ile ; as text editor shall be specified as text editor ( Settings ... editor )
&quot; should not be able to use a bug of the &amp; DVI ; if you don &apos;t want a mistake , a mistake can be found in the log file , or displayed in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol file contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button of the La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used . the log file is always displayed in the error . in order to check the error on the error , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the log@@ ging line , navigating immediately to the error line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the button is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window appears to be selected to choose the document . the default prob@@ abilities are : &quot;
&quot; if you choose from empty document , a document may be written by reason to re @-@ written or the assistant to create a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; basic users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to make the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file may open or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
when creating a new document from a template using a file some strings are replaced by other data ( such as name or string coding ) . these variables can be set up in settings .
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables will be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically they are as follows : \ \ &#91; $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@ S@@ CLAS@@
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the wi@@ z@@ ard , and thus the use of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps have been completed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your presentation can be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be created . if a simple way to create a model , it should be searched for one on the internet and the steps below are needed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as internal editor . &amp; Kate , as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for the menu directly from &amp; k@@ ile ; can be made out . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about it &amp; Kate , and his adventures should be attracted to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; you can go right there with reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the menu La@@ Te@@ X reference . you may find a description of almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with a dr@@ illed str@@ g button to express the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way clicking on the click \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ big@@ ski@@ p only \ \ par .
&quot; when pulling the text , the text of the left button is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can print the source of the source code in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the most varied types of source texts . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are emphas@@ ized by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants have a great jump stamp . in this case , it is a separate type of book@@ marks within the text . this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized if this spr@@ int stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that they are automatically handled at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; the work is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; k@@ ile ; although &amp; Kate , has been added to the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . among them are the following commands for the text code : &quot;
&quot; if a complete paragraph consists of ( group of lines , which contain a blank line ) . this extended mean@@ ings include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended significance does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; this extended cause is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; note the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also contains &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with one bucket ( \ \ ) and an additional ast@@ ical star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document may be nat@@ ured by this first and can be removed by pressing the key . &amp; Kate ; offering its own commands for faster driving . under control , the following commands are available to the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete he@@ el . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; k@@ ile ; is contained in the description of working expressions .
&quot; it has already been noted that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders inferior to work environment for a comfortable simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; &quot;
this command will be placed at the beginning of current surroundings ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the order to the public .
&quot; with this command , will be placed at the end of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the surrounding area . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ lesson { surroundings } is placed at the end of the surroundings ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many f@@ iller environment commands , this command can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified environment , so that the lost environment structure will not be broken . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; also special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups that are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . among Be@@ work Te@@ X Group are some key commands that correspond to those from working environment .
this command is placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the ref@@ us@@ al cl@@ amp .
&quot; with this command , will be placed at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the closed loop . &quot;
if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the f@@ lange cl@@ amp a &amp; tex ; group # is located at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of scra@@ ped groups bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly . this command closes the last modified group , so that the f@@ iller structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple courses are used as well . for the purpose of purpose , the character is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for the beginning of the beginning is used . &quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and leads to two closing arguments . &quot;
this automatic entry to the double start @-@ up mark can be used under settings K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be sign@@ posted .
there are also possible specific settings ( e.g. n@@ v or French ) and can be used in German or fran@@ ç@@ al . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when shifting down Shift ; input paste , and k@@ ile ; a smart Z@@ eil@@ ing break . if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , you can use the command \ \ item only at the same time . &quot;
&quot; within a tables environment , the current line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is not intelligent enough to under@@ score pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . this may be added to settings ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users can arrange the columns in tables , and all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; k@@ ile ; seeks to be encouraged ; however , this tab@@ ulator is not to be able to add up ; in some intermediate room for the current Tab@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate , already offering a good source file comprehen@@ sible , it was added to &amp; k@@ ile ; to provide special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , we work three different modes . all these modes are suitable for automatic processing of different modes . &quot;
when start a new environment through the command \ \ 1 { surroundings } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when printed , the last letter of the entry is removed , the last letter of entry is accomplished . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . the descriptions will be nat@@ ured for selection of a command . alternatively , jump to these positions can be returned , so this is a simple leap to these positions by working spr@@ inkl@@ ing stamp of jump stamp . &quot;
&quot; set by settings ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists can be made . it can be selected as well as well as well as well as if desired , the general language can be selected . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is not suitable for the processing of environments . there is always a few letters with \ \ 1 , and the appeal of the exec@@ uting mode will be used as often that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for processing the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the subject of writing mode , the menu can be done automatically or the keyboard can be checked up and it appears \ \ lesson { . afterwards , the environment may be completed on the sim@@ pl@@ est way , and by pressing the input can be finished . &quot;
&quot; after this is completed , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognizes that it is a lists environment , is even a first \ \ item command . &quot;
to set k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; complete settings for these lists can be done . this mode uses the list of the full @-@ time compensation mode for r &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ orders .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; under@@ takes user @-@ defined lists of removable strings , which are immediately replaced by simple strings . the lists can be set up for the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word must be covered by the menu of the menu or the CTR@@ L + Alt , the letter L will be replaced by the character \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ye are not helpful . however , it was found that many whales are written in a document more than once again . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the transaction is already written for all . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the men@@ ue settings ... K@@ ile Ver@@ i@@ ent bars . here , also the swelling value can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the ful@@ fil@@ ment files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / k@@ ile / / or in the Persian home folder ( ab@@ dic@@ tive ) , and tex ( alarm book ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics influences the entries of graphics as simple as possible . to the website of the basics , the sections should be considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not known as PDF files , but they offer an outstanding basis for coverage and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages will be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools to be re@@ arranged and then with ps@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to create the result of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source for viewing such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used by using Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when fitting the quick@@ ening is usually a viewer called after the comp@@ iling . should not be used , so there will be a new window . &quot;
a new project will follow the project &apos;s new project .... Hier@@ on the following information is required for the project :
&quot; when used for the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the trig@@ gers of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be administered by scripts in the vertical ly@@ re scripts .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be seen in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; still .
&quot; first , it has to be said that the output of the scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite distinctive system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional pack@@ ets . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a lot of different assistance to the user &apos;s support . &quot;
&amp; Cool@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ as ; are supplied with many documents . these include a documentation for the contained packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; a fully @-@ standing Re@@ fern@@ z for r &amp; tex ; and it &apos;s not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a fully @-@ standing manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; however , it is ideal for search for a specific form . since it is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with which &amp; grown ; / tex@@ as ; delivered , the fin@@ des of the right document is not always easy . / tex@@ as ; the small application tex@@ tures , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; supplied documents and includes a graphic surface area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or impact w@@ aging . by &amp; k@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the subject of space is possible to view the viewer .

&amp; sig ; is a graphic editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or daily signals from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; any signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signals you will read the same signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out for each day you use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this allows you to have a blank ; blank signal tone ; and insert your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file save or click the disk copy to the disk . &quot;
&quot; you can create many signatures . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always sufficiently Sign@@ atures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then click into the File File menu , or click the symbol with the red cross in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; version 3.2 by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools are unique in their integration as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ 2 . the combination makes quick , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone , who has worked with the &amp; K@@ DE , don &apos;t know it and how excessive it is . let &apos;s take it a piece , simply give it a graphic surface ! just click on a terminal ; simply click the icon for the XML processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the w@@ ret@@ ched working folder , then let the current work folders . if not , then remove the selection of current work folders and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time if you &apos;re supposed to start .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is there a great graphic surface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , then let it simply select the current working folder . if not , then select the current work folders , and enter the folder , where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is available . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to a copy on the screen , her file is in@@ correct . please check the reported error and try it again . &quot;
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; then , let them simply run the current file . if not , delete it in current file the skins and select the file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the well @-@ shaped file is , they click the Well @-@ locking selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file selection , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) , and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; using definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the processing file in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , then let it simply select the current file . if not , remove them the selected file , and select the file selected file using the other file file . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is to be named , . the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ite lus ; you may have little to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; even if you may take advantage of the additional functionality , and you don &apos;t need to wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI . more on that they will find out below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a string , we start working with the plug@@ ins menu . thus , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialogue enables to manage all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new ads . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT in it :
here you can enter the search engine . when adding plug@@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in .
many people often work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and used to identify .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as both team leader as well as sub @-@ project leader . &quot;
the user can look out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates who is looking for . this is done by sending the team member out of the list and press the gri@@ ds as it presses . currently selected member ( its identification ) appears fat after which you are : text .
nick@@ name and attitude of their own identity are important regarding messages and notes . see further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage through the collection of members of the team : it can be created an event to the team leader if something specific happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are done if something specific in the project happens . an example would be able to record the opening and closing of the project , as if a file would be saved , or the sending of a message when a file is secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S as soon as they will be added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , can be edited , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the mailing list selected address data . the address of address can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see if such ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
insert notes is simple . it can either be chosen from the editor @-@ text menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary section followed by clicking to be entered .
notes can be sent to a determin@@ ate member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team leader Head of sub @-@ project leader in the following examples should be given the corresponding area or sub@@ project names as stated in the examples below .
&quot; nick@@ name and roles names are independent of large or small en@@ roll@@ ment , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the comments do the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scri@@ pt@@ - and form@@ att@@ ing languages , the D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic and web@@ based form and scri@@ pt@@ ing languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only via &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a brief description for the others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by settings Quant@@ a ... to be called . This dialog covers some pages that will be treated after each other .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags , including car complete , can be changed . entries are : &quot;
&quot; big / small en@@ roll@@ ment of tags : large / small en@@ roll@@ ment of tags : large / small en@@ roll@@ ment means , the tags will be inserted so , as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small en@@ roll@@ ment of attributes : large / small en@@ roll@@ ment of automatically added attributes . normal Groß / small file means , the attributes will be included as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if requested , it is optional for tags , for which the closing day is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : as above all other tags , except for all other tags , except for simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start@@ - and conclusion @-@ tag automatically update : when enabled , the corresponding day will be included and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent symbols : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated signs to the corresponding coding during the typ@@ ing .
&quot; M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . using the Standard , the default settings can be restored . &quot;
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other ways than with file open @-@ opened files ( where the coding of the file can be over@@ taken ) . this setting is used by the same in the project characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD uses selected files for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized , but this setting is used by the same in the project properties , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copy , so that you can restore the document from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . it is not the same as saving the file . also for not stored documents , backup regularly , according to the set time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and Docum@@ entation can be presented either in the editor @-@ area or a private view ( or documentation in a Kart@@ ei@@ on@@ ite ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview , and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful , if the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters . &quot;
the warning News section serves the tax of the possibility to display war@@ nings by calls from no more questions .
the place to change the behaviour of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser @-@ knots in document , can be discontinued in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mou@@ sec@@ lick on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change through the structure of structure with the mouse sli@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the visu@@ alis@@ ability of the tree to work and how deep in a change of the structure will be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , in which no element is found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ation of Ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ folding for a larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it can be valid for a valid group of PHP , in which the if@@ config file means something different in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ ins can be administered by the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are the third page that can be used by any K@@ part @-@ enabled application , on the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ tion plug@@ ins must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it is not at a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information is delivered to the Plu@@ gin , so it can open the current file , the appropriate file ( path of the current file ) or the project folders . &quot;
&quot; simply load the component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in ref@@ uses to store the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts refuse to load the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; plug@@ in the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct , and if the plug@@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quantitative lus ; from version 3.3 , the error search was completely new . Die@@ support for the non @-@ built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been discontinued , as well as the support for the d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which allows different implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug@@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a matching Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plug @-@ in radio box you can change specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bug is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of controlled variables is displayed . usually appears in the left do@@ ck .
&quot; a view , in which all hold points , are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appear in the lower do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; a view that shows the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually , appears in the lower do@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or a part of the following functionality . &quot;
&quot; with this promotion , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , made , or it shares the plug@@ in to listen to Deb@@ ate demands . this action is opened by default when a project is opened , so that normally , a de@@ bug must not be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to de@@ bu@@ gger or end the Lau@@ gh@@ ter to meet requirements .
send a HTTP request to the server to a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger edition .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start and send information on the monitoring variables as well as the current lines specified . if this happens when the script is stopped , the script will start . if this is done , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script , without sending information to surveillance variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script has been given , the version begins , as soon as a requirement is placed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include faul@@ t@@ less . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to over@@ go the statement , and go to the next so as if there is not the current . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or expression may be entered , which should be monitored . the monitoring value appears in the variation view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;
&amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a work by Keith Is@@ las as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ sl ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a K@@ DE ; front @-@ end and a K@@ DE from x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g which they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keith .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can adjust &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to your needs , and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better . &quot;
&quot; document type E@@ diti@@ onn@@ ets ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for mark@@ up and scripts . their simplicity and flexibility is made up &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the brand languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; and Tag@@ XML files are made of two parts , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . day folder includes two file types , the text and instructions faster into a document than one user could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ TD . see for details about the conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , an &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dialog@@ es , the &amp; quantitative information ; for the day shows the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick setup of tags in a document without a risk of a writer . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder bear the name of the writing language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declare if they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use such a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur in a document . it may contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing more than that of itself . &quot;
type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
valid only for the type Method . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tags . this item can only occur once for any attribute . additionally , it contains the name and the type of attribute . in addition , it contains further tags that will describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; this is a single element element element . &quot;
are the source code used for the attributes in the day @-@ Edit@@ or@@ dialog and attribute tree to attribute tree to the attributes .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology within from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting page and method@@ ology names . the arguments that can be handed over to the method . may be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a box that is group@@ ed together with elements of a list . it can only occur for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
determines the location of the attribute texts written within a dialog . this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defin@@ ing tags : this item is a only element type .
there is a list of elements that end a day . this item is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML Version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and have to be che@@ ered and closed .
&quot; do not affect anything , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to review the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog is in the &amp; quantitative lus ; window to start and check out Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialog will appear to follow the simple instructions .
&quot; this feature is currently not available yet . currently , checking only during loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; ELE@@ MENT from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the file name for this day XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following , an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; revision function is described . the file name of this day XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; string &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
&quot; the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be edited via D@@ TD edit D@@ TD settings ; this can be processed using an &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP , a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with following entries are created : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; version = uses 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD @-@ indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified , the name as nick@@ name is used . &quot;
a action can be set with settings actions ... created . Click &quot; New Action &quot; to the same dialog :
&quot; this promotion has been assigned to the button . by clicking the user defined , a keyboard can be assigned ; with K@@ one the current keyboard is remote control@@ l@@ able . &quot;
the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered by text in the detection settings and inserted in the form of the action on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful shareholder type . with the help of this promotion , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) which will be launched or used as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick@@ start -@@ dialog or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter is needed . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ ext variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line :
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document , file is removed : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the running &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text is run to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters of this event , usually the file name of the current document , or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the associated methods , a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be included ; the default input can be determined , which can be sent to the default setting . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output , written on the default issue ; error messages , which should be submitted to the default issue , which is set to the default issue below : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the case it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you must add actions and configure . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window starts working mode .
fill out all the necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the Tag attributes and you are planning to process dialog &quot; Day , &quot; when available , creating an input when using the action . &quot;
ignor@@ ance ! is that a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this icon ? do we replace it before we have difficulties .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default : 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created icon does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as a symbol ) , or at least , a message to the user should be sign@@ aled ; -@@ day in the current document is required . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be associated with the action . this happens over the menu with Settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired promotion . in addition to the text field , you can press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the users and put them on with other tags , so there is , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool bar supplement , or it should be set to a better overview by some Tren@@ ner into several groups . make sure that the tool@@ bar is selected on the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the Tren@@ ner ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the Elem@@ ental , added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I want a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by test all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the correct folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool@@ bar should be loaded in the right folder ( s ) if a file will be loaded ( s ) if a file is open from the corresponding type . &quot;
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users is the option to add documentation for the scri@@ pt@@ ing language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to do . this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if anyone has done for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you have to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ cal / script / etc ; language . then you &apos;ll need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we left you to treat the second . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , regarding the document @-@ HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = # 1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the document tree . for example , see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level El@@ ements Top Element = PHP 4.2 Resources = Table of Cont@@ ents , # G@@ etting Start@@ ed , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html ... Language Reference = Basic Techni@@ que = Basic Techni@@ .@@ html @-@ syn@@ ony@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
&quot; note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content , there is no known limit for the box entry ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself . &quot;
note that the table of contents are refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistent at the top end of the tree @-@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces influence nothing but pay attention &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quantitative information ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ ab@@ ots .
&quot; the content of the section is the section of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which should be displayed in the context of a context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; H for context @-@ help , the documentation would display directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file extension lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to save and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / InterBase a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps for local or global usage . then create a folder ( such as you specify this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are certain that these are good and it &apos;s worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files using a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; - community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quantitative lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the disc ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or anything else . in different places there is an email menu entry , like D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email sending , tool@@ bar menu with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded to our main archive in our main archive , where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be downloaded and only available if our team is checked and used only if our team is guaranteed to sign the resources of resources for our team as well as for later users . &quot;
&quot; when you upload your Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you can enter a button ( URL preview can remain blank ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; upload can also instantly upload the menu D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) menu , tool@@ bar menu , and in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still under the installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quantitative eas@@ iness . in the case of problems warning it and it can then be canc@@ eled . if the integrity is given and the resource is correct , a message with the author &apos;s author appears . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ language , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , it can be time consuming , because hundreds of day files in the day XML format could be needed . there is easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically into a D@@ T@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by D@@ TD Store and Conver@@ ting to a D@@ TD menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD @-@ Description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
record label : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / quantitative / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string that should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag , like HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; the D@@ T@@ EP after the conversion : when activated , bring &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; following the conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , you must first make them more closely with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , the work area divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quantitative determination . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available to each , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . of tool@@ bars on promotions is everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administ@@ rators of various tool@@ bars , actions , and patterns in the global tree , which are available to each in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so they only can use only those users personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; samples up to work@@ stations with special actions specifically for the files of a certain project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all elements are taken in the folder &apos;s folder and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the Bau@@ man@@ ners with information and tool@@ bars . please beat in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ on with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document , like to close the current , other or all Kart@@ ei@@ on@@ ites , re@@ load , delete or up@@ loading of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right click on the editor of the editor for a further context menu concerning the processed documentation , such as basic handling steps ( cutting / copy / insert ) to edit the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open the file , if the string is described under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the Edit@@ or@@ f@@ enst@@ ers are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars will be shown . in the course of further expansion of tool@@ bars , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new functions and thus related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; in their document , click on . now you can add the data for that just one day ( like anchor ) , you can insert several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can insert several fields in a dialog . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ ion ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate in the information &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and to @-@ pass them . in the representation of cardboard , project , sample structure , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quantitative determination . this view shows all the files in the project and allows you to manage files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as add , removal , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be performed using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on &amp; quantitative templates . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only usable in the project . more to templates is listed . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available script languages . the concept of integration in the Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information on a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as edit the script , edit or send by email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . through left @-@ click of an elementary document , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of element . through the right click of an elementary proposition you can open a list of commands in relation to navigation and request of the building . &quot;
&quot; this tree is among the other builders . with him can change man@@ quickly attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . this allows the content of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks , with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded pre@@ paid documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document management , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and considered . &quot;
by default &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two Kart@@ ei@@ on@@ ites at the bottom end of the window can be reached : the news window and the problem window .
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ on@@ ite shows information about each in Quant@@ a running script . so , for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and changes to D@@ TD . &quot;
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ on@@ ites shows all errors in the check up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; quantitative lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate material of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ;
&quot; another function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar by mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; and if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can ass@@ ure them in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other backup and load ! &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options added to the configure script . in order to understand a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems when starting up &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check whether your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder . you should also make sure that there is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a Web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor to create , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious , ext@@ end@@ able brand @-@ up editor now ? well , this would make him the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer in pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now it is far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quantitative ; for that suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s not only this possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quantitative lus ; allows Web@@ developers to improve the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can expand productivity dramatically , with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars ; they can be able to remember any scripts without any script language . ( more on this they find in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ a ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been conceived for a fast web development , and has been upgraded quickly to a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; plus is in no way connected to commercial versions of &amp; quant@@ a ; the original developers left the GP@@ L license and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more detailed documentation , please contact : / quantitative ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quantitative ) . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ a ; is currently being developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time when you open a file , which is not located where the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . look at the section above templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project management software , only one error has been reported . &quot;

&quot; displays the symbol plate from the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when book@@ marks in the current file , they will be appearing in the menu with entries preceding or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group following the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . you can copy graphics files into your project folders or a sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .

dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates just the name . actions must be saved through settings actions ... and you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar .
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the visible area . this does not delete it from hard disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you would like to do that . &quot;
so you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; team that is present the tool@@ bar in the next release ) . the menu option opens up a new E@@ Mail message with tool@@ bar as App@@ endi@@ x .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
invite a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone has made someone else and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own smooth @-@ format .
&quot; invite / re@@ fresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ EP ; to renew the whole &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; if this globally is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , fails to load the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allows access to the current Day promotion dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu Tags : followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart insert of tags . currently , this does not work with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smart inser@@ tion means that &amp; quantitative determination is ref@@ using when this day is contra@@ dict@@ ated to this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the listed menu points . Click to click on the activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
cho@@ oses the Syn@@ tax@@ er@@ mination mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ring schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; choose type of line identification . very useful if you know people , use other OS platforms for the developers . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check out the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application of Ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the various types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended by default card mode , which is also the default settings , or the sub@@ woofer mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 , and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for any open sub@@ window . selecting a contract , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
switches the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window and off .
&quot; changes in this dialogue offers any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; jud@@ ging the editor of the editor . in the Docum@@ entation of &amp; Kate , you can find details . &quot;
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or which can then change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in the field of mouse , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quantitative lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely lic@@ ated , but as at any open source project developers can help use the developers always help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed by the top of the project , for example , after filling the project called the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
that is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine on which you want to access . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and default templates . if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool@@ bars will be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a joint collection of files used for different projects should be set to this folder instead of standards . &quot;
allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or whole folder may be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have to download and change the static web content ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; registered , if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be bound up . if a project is started ane@@ w , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed inside the main folder and you can make an exact selection to be thin . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by check@@ ers or , by removing the hem@@ or@@ ator , cl@@ amp up out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wi@@ z@@ ard contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can be upload in the menu with project properties in the menu area profiles or to be changed using the CTR@@ zel Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholder are possible ) which can be used for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supplem@@ entary option to the above , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the projec@@ tors , which will be loaded during opening the project , can be read more about projec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; with this , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plu@@ gin can be discontinued with the button options . in this case , the error search is described . &quot;
&quot; in the lower window profiles , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as display of a tree view for each profile , pointing out a separate construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ panel team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the lower window event configuration , one can change event actions and add these actions , change or delete these actions , if a certain event occurs , such as the views of a file . see details in details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project , which was open , cannot influence this behavior . &quot;
to open a different project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project will open from the tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project approaches gives free access to the files in the project . there you can be managed to manage files in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but lack of entries must be opened and open up with ... in conversation with the right mouse button &quot;
here you can find different profiles . the profile contains information on the site of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows the removal of current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is low to prevent removal . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep in the core memory and forget in the program . this option is useful if common up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather uns@@ afe password on the record store option does not come into question . &quot;
&quot; that will stop the transmission or simply leave dialogue , if you want to change your opinion before up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be uploaded to the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; that is the server name , which should be copied onto the files . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and NFS . &quot;
the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate on the usual port .
&quot; depending on your anxiety , this is either a temporary function or a danger . use it to your discretion . the password will not be read on the plate , but everyone can be read easily in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project overview is only one set of files and tool bar . it can be loaded with many views in a project , i.e. by simple divers of view , and replace the current files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bars project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own work mode .
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool bar in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best on the menu tool@@ bar . use and Add themselves . adding tool bar will be treated below in the section add tool bar . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be adjusted either through context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action can be set , the tool@@ bar can be done , which can be specified in the dialog , where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , in addition , the entries will be removed and used action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and settings actions .. be set .
&quot; templates are based on the essential documentation , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates basically as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each at the system existing directory in the storage room . templates have in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions mentioned for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
&quot; bin@@ ge is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary . binary templates are usually found in documents using global templates . further information is available for templates . &quot;
documents can be created by any text documentation . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally a simple sc@@ aff@@ old for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate ways to be efficiently . see in for more information on the templates .
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything , from a comment on a final menu up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder Development archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure according to popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select the file as a model store .... &quot;
&quot; as soon as it has been done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage space below project areas . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click on the file as a template selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be pulled with pulling and insert on the tree @-@ view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file is only enough to copy in a file folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as goat and insert or insert about the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder or in the project files , select a name for the template and secure a site for the template , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
project areas enable a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design to insert files or link with them . in addition you can keep some things when using templates in projects very deep in mind .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files based in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quantitative / quant@@ a / Tem@@ plates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers such as above .
&quot; to order the behavior of a folder , click on the template with the right mouse button on the folder and select the text menu features . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as once their attributes can be coated . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything apart from the tribe of regular intervals . if a regular folder would be able to dis@@ able unless they would be explicitly enabled . in the case of a normal folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text size . if nothing appears , it is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
allows ordering or submitted text for templates in this folder . this could be general head lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the appropriate head lines / foot@@ er lines .
&quot; additionally , you have a menu menu ( shown below , press right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the menu View Editor through the V@@ PL ; editor and the second , the editor window will be divided into two parts : the source code editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor is as follows : it invites you to edit a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit , and if necessary , you can edit the source code in the V@@ PL ; editor in source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ity of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change this behavi@@ oral pattern . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that at the same time the changes are enabled both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; Editor syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressing F@@ 9 this mode is activated , this mode is already active , the keyboard printing is activated by a window to others , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Quant@@ a ; you can automatically choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in addition , the recommendation can be adjusted between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted for fast computers and a large span@@ ne for slow PC . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the processing of invisible tags is possible , as soon as a new document is created by the V@@ PL ; it is used as a new document with the V@@ PL ; this means that you can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. bu@@ zz@@ words for internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to the writing of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules to the list below the list is exactly how the met@@ a @-@ elements are possible . the editing of CSS rules is not currently supported .
&quot; it is possible to tie an external CSS breast@@ feeding system by pressing the button , and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of cur@@ sors is like in a text processing , possible through evidence of arrows , possible . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor behave like usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be deleted by typ@@ ing or delete . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way via the tool@@ bars as in the source code editor , which should be noted that the inser@@ tion of tags can already be inserted already existing identical tags , e.g. an anchor tag , must be removed with text , every other will need to be removed . &quot;
some tool bulbs such as tables assist@@ ent or the list@@ ings are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to be used in this release the tables or lists of tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the investigation of breast@@ plates . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding times the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the breast@@ feeding can be persecuted .

adds the parameters by name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ gt ; added to the X@@ SL environment variable . see also documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
&quot; conversion 20 times when --@@ repeat two times , the conversion will run 100 times &quot;
&quot; input documents are handled as HTML files , if the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; the X@@ include processing of input document , if the support has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is switched on . &quot;
&quot; on systems with installed Read@@ line library , you can turn the arrows on / off through the exp@@ iry of the commands so far . &quot;
several commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to put together expressions than a argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; set as an argument with the name &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Uni@@ x@@ - or Cy@@ g@@ win systems may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder . on RIS@@ C @-@ OS systems also additional environmental variables are allowed .
path : a path to change the work folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML _ document that is edited by the breast@@ feeding template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and lt ; UR@@ I@@ gt ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected many places . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts .
&quot; the program was used to me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indications that this change was a little night@@ mare . &quot;
so this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later a lot of further useful functions were added later .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare fast text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function converted &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ quality file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of co@@ de and can make changes . the original file ( the basis ) helps to edit the correct result . in this editor , you can even edit the results directly . in this editor , the image shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you complete with the same and merge complete folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder @-@ merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and are based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you often have co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble if no one changes the inser@@ tion . )
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other distingu@@ ishes in one line , then the color indicates which file different is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files are the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy the Ti@@ p@@ par@@ work by simply write the file names of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder , folder 2 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , diff@@ 3 folder , folder 3 folder folders &quot;
&quot; opening dialogue allows manual type of file names to select a selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or select a last edited file from the list of the folding box . if you do not have a third file , you don &apos;t need to specify the third file ; if you have to leave the registration for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; select a folder via the button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge file will be selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame consists of A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when assem@@ bling , the input field is active for the target and can be changed . however , it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file later . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
you can open a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start using the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text file . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins , you can easily connect the dialog with the button button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use bricks and shut@@ down : simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains such functions . if you would like to find out how these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would have to compare and compare two appropriate files , and then compare and compare these relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can get nothing out of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the f@@ allen@@ ger text is supported in a compar@@ ative window .
warning : some editors interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case your original data could go lost .
&quot; in the upper part every text window is the info line . the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse will rest on the line . then a small aux@@ iliary window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source codes are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed via the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is recognized , one can differ in the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is very useful in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text , the merge column is located . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + Z. B. , white characters are only important in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare individual cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the merge column from the text , is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison of the comparison ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; ge@@ changes &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving disabled is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jumps to the most dissolved / un@@ break@@ est conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ is@@ ers are used , every difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; through one click on the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group is highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group is then highlighted by the current Group . ) This group will be emphas@@ ized with the color background colour for current area and each on the left will appear in black bars . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , by automatic connection or by manual function do not have any more line left in the group ; then , in these lines the text and lt ; no line is indicated in the file ; this text will not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking you may have to copy and elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; introduc@@ tions ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : if you select the options to ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; navigate mainly with the image running and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using in one of the window , you can also use the arrow keys to the right , side , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , just as you can use it by clicking here . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ ss window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the insert button you can switch between inser@@ tion and writing mode . ( default is the entry mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns is synchron@@ ized the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already explained in the assembly and the ed@@ itable evaluation window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards / str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore you must differenti@@ ate between dissolved and un@@ break@@ able conflicts .
&quot; to copy the marking in the cli@@ p@@ board , you must automatically copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is activated , what always you mark will automatically copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and check the manual copy . be careful if you could over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line @-@ up will be saved according to the initial operating system . UNIX versions use a line @-@ in @-@ feed @-@ character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use car back @-@ in \ \ r \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the line @-@ down of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files will be automatically saved and re@@ manufactured at the next start . ( menu setup - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 )
&quot; select a script with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog can select documents with variable width , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in ital@@ ic script will be displayed . if the chosen text does not support this presentation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some of the colors couldn &apos;t be available in their pure form but would be rendered straight . on these systems , the button pre@@ ferences will automatically form an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , the tab@@ ulator button will be inserted into the respective number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you select input or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each option is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual will then be checked into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer to save . the default value is the general choice on the operating system used .
&quot; when trying to locate &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all @-@ identical lines can be ignored in the source file . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step can &apos;t be ignored . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car back @-@ in &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , others again , save files with different sizes from the page @-@ to @-@ page comparison , but then you might be able to switch with different sizes on page @-@ to @-@ side comparison . if this option is activated , this option can be disabled . in default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still indicated , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files but slowly at very large files .
&quot; in the automatic start mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ break@@ able conflict will be passed . &quot;
&quot; replaces all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) That is useful if white signs in many files are less important . if you are using only time to pass , if the options are ignored in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . &quot;
these options are treated in the chapter on scanning of folders and implementation of a merge . see for details under documentation for comparison and coll@@ ision .
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without additional f@@ use . &quot;
fits the language of user interface . changing this option does not fit the current running program . you must end and restart the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is available globally over the control centre . )
&quot; the following code settings can be adjusted separately for each entry . if you use this option , the upper limit is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; a short notice about the selection fields for the coding is a short notice , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file coding for source files . this influences such as special characters can be treated , interpreted as special characters . as the encoding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used to save . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ fabri@@ cation command , you might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files can handle 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) using this option one can define the coding of the pre @-@ processing command . &quot;
&quot; turn off to supp@@ ress the changes in white characters in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignored or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a color @-@ coded overclo@@ cking column are displayed . but sometimes you may see the differences between two of three files . depending on the normal mode , C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal c@@ auti@@ ous column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window next to each other . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and decide to bring the files together . a simple click starts together in the merge menu . if you use only two files . if this function is used , the file name is used as default for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be delivered to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use this function e.g. for cutting distur@@ bing parts or for correction . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is just the command line . you may have your own pre@@ processor that fits exactly your needs . each input line must have a corresponding issue line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to make users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program it yourself . however , good news is that in most cases used or per@@ l completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to change the input in a row letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ S / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ ing systems use some key words to automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern is $ key@@ word in accordance with the $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may like this regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line off the line &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and every score is replaced by nothing , so basically deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you may want to perform several experiences at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; to separate the data from each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ dings are needed for per@@ l some details . where used \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and coll@@ ision . the following operations can only change the data that looks like the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the line @-@ in pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and assembled complete folder with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder . &quot;
... &quot; makes a proposal for any object ; you can adjust the proposal before start , &quot;
&quot; can sim@@ ulate the merge and show the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really accomplish , &quot;
... &quot; leads selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compare and merge of single files . you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as base . if no target file has been specified , is used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folders . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , do not merge the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the read of the folder you will inform you a small news window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; the scanning of the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and any folder was found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure will normally be folded together . you can click a folder , click on the + / - click on the item , or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right and add all sub@@ directories to which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file will be rest@@ art@@ ed and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . if the interaction is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the columns A / B / C are red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; identical with identical record , the colour is also identical , even if the age of entries are different . &quot;
&quot; folder will be considered to be identical , when their overall content is identical . then folder the same color . in folders , the age is un@@ considerable for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is first green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when a folder and B file is ) : errors : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when a file and B one file is ) : errors : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects cannot be started .
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders are enabled and if the option can synchron@@ ize directories . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action will be identical . if for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after the merge and k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select a new file instead of merge ( un@@ secure ) , then the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange are not eliminated , the result may not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge a file is executed after the others . it &apos;s status column indicates when the result was successful , and the other messages , if something unexpected , if the result is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is in order . &quot;
&quot; if set in the setup dialog the file compar@@ ative analysis is selected , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ break@@ fast@@ ly sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ uble conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can merge either the selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target file , then the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as a target , when two @-@ folder merge will be selected and when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the folder structure , also in the folder structure , check these options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
to put all entries in the directory : select directory entry / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key@@ note ) . just press action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by contra@@ dict@@ ory data types , there are still invali@@ d mer@@ ging actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ts elements . you can select a valid promotion for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options , sim@@ ulating and break down . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to see what would happen , without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( lead to a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( please note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select directories again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you are not stored yet , a corresponding dialogue appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to select the problem of the problem , or to solve the problem to solve the problem , before you proceed with the interaction . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were merged individually , not@@ ices &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current meeting ) and performs them together at later , these entries will be considered as closed . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings menu - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ) has now set a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that are shown on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate samples can be entered into the element tree . the plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be done more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ one ; as partition sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be done more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ one ; as partition sign . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ matic generated files will be ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder is specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see below info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some file systems files have a file attribute . in other file systems , a file attributes has been labeled . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the Elem@@ ent@@ tree or not . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic compatibility will be compared . if the option is on , the files will be compared to the links . this is disabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sively through . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not on possible records . ) This option is switched off to a final folder and crash@@ es off . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; performs a complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the number of deleted , un@@ break@@ able , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding Anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders via a slow network , it may seem to compare only the date of change and the file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain degree of security . please be careful with caution . &quot;
&quot; similar to trust date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered to be identical , if they are equal in size , for example , to be useful if copying the date of changes lost . please be careful with caution . this option is activated in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ize mode if two folders are compared and no target files are specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merge will be identical . the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copy of the newer file is proposed as an action . ( this is considered in@@ secure , because it is not provided that the other file has not been modified . you should check this in any case ) . &quot;
&quot; if a file or file will be replaced or deleted by another file , then the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ ami . if an old backup file with the .@@ original extension is already existing , this will also refer to the normal merge file , not only the mer@@ ging full folder . this option is switched on in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge list remains visible to the merge files . if you don &apos;t want to move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to split up the main window in the window menu and switch between directory &amp; Text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file easily by clicking on . yet , you can install a single file directly in the directory menu . as soon as you save the folder , the status will be put together and the file will not be merged again when you start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory -@@ menu : read more &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that you can open on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a file within a compressed archive with a local file .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . some things should be considered :
a path can be relatively und@@ red or .. contain . this is not possible with UR@@ Ls . these are always absolute .
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the fil@@ esystem to the server , sometimes by the used protocol . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
or it cannot be differenti@@ ated whether a link is shown on a file or folder . then a file will always be adopted as a link goal . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore soak the per@@ missions or change from the original . ( please note the option of trust the size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is currently as a difference viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts always the built @-@ in differences viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a box , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch will start to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Con@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview of - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . the interaction or the comparison of folders will not be supported in the box mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now , it is Com@@ pare ) already . additionally , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 indicates that it may result together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by reading other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who went this way or go so .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources compiled and configure the configure script . in the default , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to Each one , this is no . &quot;
the editor refers to any difference in the files where it begins and where he ends . this important information is lost but if the result is simply stored in the source file and select the result simply as text file and it &apos;s too much effort to design an additional file format that might save this information .
the effort for this was too big so far . you can recover a certain version always through selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used .
&quot; after removing text , no sr@@ c lin@@ ux ; released and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bugs reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need to use &amp; K@@ DE , 3.1 or later . &quot;
&quot; for information , how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage . &quot;
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; sound 3 ; on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find further details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or conversion ) copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position or replaces the current mark .
&quot; only differences indicate : files that are identical in all folders , not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you need to change the folder to these options with the function Re@@ fresh . )
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are shown . if the target file does not already contain the target file . if the target file does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons for the selection of the source with the lab@@ eling A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are already attached to the end of the selected group ( if they are already present ) , they will be removed by clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . Under@@ shooting in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual desktop . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the desktop , to stop her size , or to move it . this works both inside a work@@ space and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual desktop space as well as the applications where applications can be selected , and can be moved to other applications . &quot;
&quot; with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both working area and other working areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; p@@ ager ; click on the empty background , the text and the name of the application and the entries are printed , maxim@@ ize , on working area and end . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . it appears only if installed on an application .
&quot; if the check@@ box is marked , windows can be moved inside &amp; p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop , and also be moved to other working areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , will be shown in the &amp; p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual desktop . &quot;
&quot; cross this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual desktop display . it &apos;s along with name , the names are provided with the ordin@@ ator numbers , and eg ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working area is shown as background in the &amp; p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . otherwise only the empty work@@ space will appear to allow their selection . &quot;
here is selected the view of the program window . simple rectangle with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here you can find the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the main window is intended : classic lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in some different window managers are known ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a horizontal row and vertically in a vertical row , which is very well suited to the representation of the working area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini@@ atures in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , show windows as symbols or with its content . furthermore , it runs out of the control panel . &quot;
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by selecting a switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; currently , this cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you do not apply a write permission for the file , you must register the key win@@ dow@@ ry mode and to as@@ sign a value to this file . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE basic package . &quot;

&quot; &amp; I like , is a very powerful application that constantly extends for new functions . it is optimised for use on high @-@ speed machines . &quot;
if you &amp; k@@ mag ; start a window as described above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following will be displayed as an magni@@ fying window . the image that is displayed in the magni@@ fying window is described in the following as selection window .
&quot; in the default setting up &amp; I like ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mov@@ able micro@@ scope . alternatively , you can add &amp; k@@ mag ; for this causes a selected screen area in the enlargement window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse panel ( eg ; on the left hand side ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that it is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrows and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can catch the contents of the magni@@ fying stones and move it with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you add to the &amp; Shift key , press button or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; and I like ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , into a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later to other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts and stop the updating of the display . stop the update , that time needed CPU time against 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will appear in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically likes your introduced short commands to store files , open up of a new window , printing , Ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and fi@@ dd@@ lers &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen saver . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; in addition , you can use a micro@@ scope to use the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is used for different people of use : from research , or artist to the web designer or t@@ end@@ han@@ dicapped . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome ( repet@@ itive strain in@@ depen@@ dency syndrome ) , and every single click pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulated a mouse click once a mouse click on the same place . it is thought to help people suffering from the repet@@ itive strain In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and to those every single click pain . this also requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can circum@@ vent the pain that arises when clicking on the click of mouse . unfortunately , you may cause pain that can be related to your computer using the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not done . &quot;
&quot; in order to clari@@ fy it again : even if &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain , which can arise when clicking with the mouse , is used against pain that can be caused by pressing the mouse , use the result for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click once you break the motion .
&quot; the smart shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse button . move it up to the end of the movement before letting out the mouse button . in this way you can take a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
this ref@@ us@@ al time must be stored after the end of the maus@@ oleum before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ ler is switched on , the turns shift ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the bottom of the mouse , wait until the mouse button is dischar@@ ged again if there is no evidence for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . is this function activated , followed by a break , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . a slower case is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can sh@@ orten the response time . open the &amp; k@@ control center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the Sound System and here the tab . there &apos;s a sl@@ ender sound buffer , which you can cut off at a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; start at every start of &amp; K@@ DE ; this function is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; please select the respective documentation to determine how to start there a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all the settings back to the values that were logged in the opening of the dialog . if you already pressed the users , you have already reset the settings for the latest pressures of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first use the default settings . especially the smart shift should be used first . if you have used to the automatic mouse click , you can later take the smart shift later . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times by &amp; K@@ DE ; at sounds too . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not provide link to un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . you can thus park the mouse to such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ led , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be clear if you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and dirt can be scra@@ pped with a flat blade or finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system interru@@ pts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are going to use the smart shift , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end through the letting of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem exists in that you run yourself a mouse click . this is reset by the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to perform cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor to place where you want it . however , use the mouse to a neutral area of working area , if you don &apos;t want to make sure that the mouse buttons are un@@ intenti@@ onal reactions . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter and cover ; the grey areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the title lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart shift , but I can &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it needs its time before you can handle it , or to insert it in the cli@@ p@@ board or to add any other action if you &apos;re likely to prepare problems with pressing mouse button . however , there are some advice to them . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart stuff , if you just start to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the text instead of a mouse click instead , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means every time when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . later , you can use the smart shifts also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for this you need some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; you have to be installed , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window ; that should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the audi@@ ble mouse click is available only if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker and is set correctly .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; put the mouse button shortly ver@@ har@@ den . this program was developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome , and prepare the resi@@ sts of the Mau@@ sta@@ est pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can be configured as well , that a certain time is waiting for a drawing process begins , before the mouse button is let go . in this way , the goat also can be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that can talk to her computer with the sil@@ ently user .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , you can let dum@@ b users can speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation sets , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which will be used later for the text issue of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard textbook password . you can often choose the text passages without having to type . these passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) you determine the dictionary for the word accessibility . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can compare the word lists using an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ read@@ ed words into the word accessibility . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clear and essentially contains an input field for the key@@ word of your sentences ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a run memory of already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
&quot; if you k@@ mouth ; right , you can enter the phr@@ ases that you want to hear . every spoken movement is attached to the memory space . you can select from it sentences which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings ; set up ... open the setting dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialogue contains two cardboard cards , speech output and settings , the site settings , and the site K@@ TT@@ SD language . &quot;
&quot; in the Command Line command , enter the command to call the voice extension . in the selection box below the input field , place the drawing code , with the text to the voice generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two species to pass the text . select the check@@ box when the text remains unchanged as standard input at the voice generator .
&quot; if the check@@ box is not selected , the text will be given as parameters . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output from your language generator . you will find the documentation to your language generator . examples are here in app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; to pass as language service , &amp; k@@ mouth will continue to pass as the first attempt to pass the text to K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings are available on this page . the kt@@ ach@@ d language service is a &amp; K@@ DE ; applications that is currently being installed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is sensible , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first sel@@ ector action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the key@@ word or by choosing a text passage in the menu written reference book or in the bust for text@@ books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ on , the selected text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted into the memory box . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage is only entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , you can define whether the text adjustment book will be automatically stored when the handling system can be automatically stored . &quot;
&quot; if you select the written reference manual , the book is stored . if you select changes , the text is password is not stored , select &amp; k@@ mouth will ask whether the text of password is to be saved . &quot;
the site concerns contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word accessibility . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box that contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box you can choose the currently used dictionary for word accessibility .
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries , or add the sequence of books , or to file it into a file . below the list you can adjust the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of each words is easily determined by counting of the occurr@@ ence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , in order to add only correct words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries have been merged , and how these weights are to be used . &quot;
&quot; this option lets you submit a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new words automatically adds to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of the window for processing of text adjustment is two divided . in the upper part you are displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can select the text passage or the appropriate key@@ note . if you have selected a textbook published , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; select actions such as new passages , or books , or select selected text passages and books , you can either reach the menu in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or over a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text passages or text passages , you can change your mouse to the new position or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt , button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text section is selected , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is located in the input field , this is used otherwise , otherwise the selected sets of the s@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; if the menu entry is crossed , a different tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands are displayed . by mouse click on the narrow left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window with references above the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if the menu entry is crossed , a shift box is indicated with entries . the bar is arranged by default via the editing window . through mou@@ sec@@ lick on the shaded left side and pulling , the tool bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; you probably have to set the command for the language issue no right or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up , open the page General Settings and enter the command for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers in other details . ) &quot;
&quot; the Edinburgh will be available in English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch . the license is currently supported only in English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch . the license allows for free to use the festival free and spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Festival in the / usr / local / festival is installed . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an integrated language generator . currently he supports the English language language . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and spread without restrictions .
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the set of speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / mar@@ qu@@ ettes . the language version is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option has to send data as standard input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ eme . license is allowed to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ eme to MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax enjoys the final sign of the text , so that an additional sign must be added . the whole command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; ech@@ o quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ e / usr / local / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / d@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in line . the data will be switched on as default entry .
&quot; the speech output d@@ us@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ further voice service , which is available to all &amp; K@@ DE ; applications currently has a standard interface for speech output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems . &quot;
&quot; as the voice can only be done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you need to use as an language service as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setting up the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully , you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires around 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can &apos;t talk , text by the calcul@@ ator . it will be saved to a list already used pro@@ positions that the user can always be re@@ produced again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer includes . there must be a language syn@@ thesizer installed on the computer .

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - The speech output system of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is a modules of existing service , which allows each application to read the text via the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . there is a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programm@@ ers ready to be equipped with the T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . users also offers interesting opportunities .
read texts ( or parts of them ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications .
&quot; the speech output is done via the tool disp@@ at@@ cher , the various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc ; used . &quot;
allows the generation of language expenditure on the command line ( or by shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; -@@ help program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;

a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts of it .
&quot; a module for the text editor &amp; Kate , with which a text file can be read or partially read . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) , you can find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / K@@ DE Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developer will also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you register , you will need to install program processor @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ o or as long as no actors are furnished , the map nar@@ r@@ ator will appear . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card &apos;s map will be posted . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , as well as different males or female , or those that are in volume or speed . you can also use several variants to syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you should also use several variants for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you should also use a speaker at least before you &amp; kt@@ ops , because the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher is otherwise used . &quot;
different spokes@@ persons for the same Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printer drivers .
&quot; if you click on the map nar@@ rows of spokes@@ persons in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ o , the map nar@@ r@@ ator will appear . this also appears automatically when you start a kt@@ ops and not yet a speaker is set up . &quot;
all already furnished speaker appear in this list . the preferred speaker will appear in the list . the chief speaker will be used for speech output if there is no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker on the list a line further down . the order of the speaker is also given its priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; select one voice type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a jun@@ k and girl agree to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new spokes@@ man appears on the map subject . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the box card and check if language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is checked , so the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; K@@ DE is starting . see . now you can use text orders to create text orders and manage . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the language pro@@ curement system of &amp; K@@ DE . Click on the card ticket to open this cardboard card . here you can adjust some general options here . &quot;
&quot; mark this check@@ box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this start has been successfully displayed , and you can create text orders and read text orders . see . remove the marking , the K@@ TT@@ SD is activated and the T@@ TS @-@ System by &amp; K@@ DE will be disabled . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ t@@ sm@@ o ends , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue , if the field output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if the check@@ box is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system range of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this range , you can start text orders , stop , stop and record . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this range , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; read or read a text file to read , and you can also change the speaker for a contract . &quot;
&quot; on applic@@ ation@@ ally or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will be displayed if the K@@ TT@@ SD is started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the map of the card and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text of the displayed website . check out the text that is read and select in the main menu Tools text . after a short time the speech output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always convenient to mark the text of a web site . you can jump this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ er lines and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE , you can read the text file . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts . then check the text that will be read and choose the text menu . then the language issue should start . &quot;
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quant@@ a ; .
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system by &amp; K@@ DE , which you will notify about you fixed events . you can also read the text of this news by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE , you can address various kinds of messages . you can inform yourself if in an IR@@ C channel a message appears when your nick@@ name comes first . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the Settings menu settings this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy can vary depending on application . &quot;
&quot; it is a good example of the string to fix and correct to correct messages . the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which has been sent to the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . you removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be accepted as provided in most cases . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text will be edited , before it is sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation to choose wrong words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to avoid a suitable speech and nar@@ r@@ ator of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the mode of filtering it is important to know how the program &quot; Spe@@ ak @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with text . &amp; kt@@ ts , distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be read on all the other orders . when the release of the screen reader is read , the requested orders will be resumed . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning has prec@@ e@@ dence and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will be resumed after the release of the warning .
News have the next highest priority . a message interru@@ pts the normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text on a website you can welcome the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every mission you encounter from the map of orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications that have text orders . text orders are intended to have any special drums . &quot;
&quot; all four order cards are processed in queu@@ e @-@ long , with the exception of the output of screen Re@@ aders . when an application has read the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a read , this output is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text orders and to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters work the text and put it on the next filter . at the time there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can be more kinds of filters .
replace character string . replace parts of a text by other lyrics . you can select either as words or as a regular expressions . it is compiled by text or for the form@@ att@@ ing of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehen@@ sible form .
&quot; XML ; - Trans@@ former is using a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to a different format . in the scope of supply of &amp; X@@ HTML , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; you can send orders on the text content or depending on the program that send text to &amp; kt@@ ts . if you have set a female voice on the map speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about it . see . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters can be applied , according to which he will be applied for a speech output . if the filter is fixed , he will not apply the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning , or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to &amp; kt@@ ts , will be edited by all activated filters , which are set up on the page below . processing of the filter is carried out in the list below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . is a filter not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be removed from the top after down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter , select the type of fil@@ let , and it will be displayed next below . &quot;
&quot; to set a list of words or regular expressions then enter a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged with the corresponding replacement text . great and small en@@ roll@@ ment will not be considered by comparison . &quot;
&quot; enter your filter for your filter . you can choose any name , it only needs to distinguish themselves by the name of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces him in accordance with the character string . the list is published in the shown order from above .
Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can store a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , store the current list or delete a file from a file , the entries will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language shown here , the filter is only applied , if the speaker for the text request is one of the registered languages . Click the button to select a list of languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ em@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID run program can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , you can only enter the applic@@ ation@@ .@@ ID @-@ 34@@ 32 only . &quot;
&quot; the strings filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compar@@ ing words , the string can be used as a regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . the words must therefore be limited by separation characters ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you don &apos;t find instructions to write regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regulatory &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sive &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&quot; and XML ; Trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be installed on well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached over the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the spokesperson on filters you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the map speaker , or to a speaker with specific characteristics . you can set for example that texts by k@@ mail is to be read by a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; write a text to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker will be selected based on the speaker &apos;s subject , and send the characteristics of the speaker &apos;s nar@@ r@@ ator , you can write the selected spokes@@ man on the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions , you can call this button on the button to get help at input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to in@@ hibit the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here , place the characteristics of the desired microphone conditions . if the text is fulfilled the filter conditions , the speaker is selected to show the desired requirements on the right to view the dialog talk selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load or delete all settings .
&quot; the microphone input filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply with one entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you need to apply at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the speech output API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programmer to give their applications T@@ TS @-@ capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module , added with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing &amp; kt@@ ts to use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the speech output API by &amp; K@@ DE , and the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is will be found on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) . &quot;
applications call for voice information on the &amp; bus ; interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of lyrics to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you will give :

none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I &apos;ve created the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; form@@ at@@ er@@ filter , but when the module for the festival will not read websites . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you have to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ do so you have to do so if you do not use this voice to read web pages . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be found and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or interru@@ ptions appear to cause errors in syn@@ thesizer , so that all pro@@ positions will be spent on the syn@@ thesizer ; what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed through a string binding filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer that are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the relevant websites . there are also voices that possess an own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code library , you can download the package k@@ de@@ .de with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you will find the source code from k@@ de@@ v below ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / . &quot;
contains a lot of languages supported by a list of all currently supported languages on the page htt@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Sav@@ bio . &quot;
KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . see also on the web site . , after information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; Spe@@ ak disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for voice syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , you sit with the development team in connection . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not necessary , but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ts ; you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the package files for the program &quot; Spe@@ ak disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ts , refer to the source archive for k@@ icking , or to download each night up tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before reading &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if the user disp@@ at@@ cher works with your language syn@@ thesizer correctly . to do this , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scri@@ pt SPD @-@ conf file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which will be developed so further that the program of the tool disp@@ at@@ cher is so further developed that the establishment of a tool disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script DP @-@ conf will no longer be needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be dismant@@ led in individual sentences . the user can , repeat or ab@@ out@@ dated , repeat the output or ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; if you have an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can request the attributes of the preferred speaker for the output . if you want to find a speaker , whose language is English and whose gender is female , this is the best matching speaker . if you want to find out more about how &amp; kt@@ ts , see you in . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the map nar@@ r@@ ator to add , and to edit a speaker on the list or on request , the card speaker is shown on the list . for details , you will find details about the modules . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is contained in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text to be handed over to the festival . by voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts . generally , these attitude will be made automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sl@@ ur@@ ists , you will adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some controls and displayed this grey , these settings choose from you chosen voice . &quot;
&quot; several voices such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size , so when you select this check box , these voices will be syn@@ thes@@ ized at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set of faster is syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to click on users ) . see . &quot;
&quot; if this check@@ box is marked , the program window is displayed on the system section . otherwise , after the start , the program window is visible , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if K@@ TT@@ SD is not running a text , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . by this way , you have the opportunity to stop or run otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in queu@@ e @-@ long , along with the application that ordered the order , the number of phr@@ ases and the just processed sentence . the speaker ID is equivalent to the ID card on the ant@@ it@@ ei@@ card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this range , you can select a full @-@ trip on the order that is selected or go back in the list below . ( but not every mission consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cardboard cards ) and the kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the box audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , war@@ nings and news are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts . find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component can not be selected , it was compiled and compiled without support for the appropriate audio module , and it cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if g@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . have you chosen AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
&quot; make the speech speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speed speed . so that settings can be implemented , the program SO@@ x must be installed . &quot;
please click on users to take over the new settings for running &amp; kt@@ on ; system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you must find out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can setup special actions that will always be executed when the text message is interrupted by a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processed four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be presented to all the other orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be resumed . &quot;
war@@ nings are the next priority . this stage is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is going to be hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message interru@@ pts the normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application to read the news . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome the room . &quot;
&quot; a text message is interrupted by a message , warning , or issue of a screen re @-@ reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queu@@ es . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , if a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as an introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this cardboard card apply only for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read &amp; check messages ; get read messages , start kt@@ ops and click al@@ erts . the map noti@@ fications appear . &quot;
&quot; mark this check@@ box to switch the pre @-@ reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts , reads no al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears to add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that you send and accounts ; if someone has mentioned your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
&quot; all events , for which in the list cannot be stated otherwise , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use this radio box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ts , if an event is arriving . you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you select custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard cho@@ oses the speaker who will appear in the list on the map nar@@ r@@ ator as the top entry .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if the action is specified for a certain event , the action is executed . otherwise , the action is specified for all other events of the particular application . as last option , the action is used to carry out the action under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event will be all al@@ erts for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . in this case you can define the noti@@ fying messages like this :
&quot; use the button Save to save the settings for the al@@ erts in a file . use the button loading , to load stored settings from a file . if you want to delete the events in the list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice issue . this standard contains brands for controlling the voice of voices , the volume , volume , volume and sound level . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
&quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , which is used in the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound conditions in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML Version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE , PU@@ BL@@ IC / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis / / D@@ TD Syn@@ thesis . who has slept in my bed ? asked the bear son . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and sat@@ ord@@ ability recognition filter ( SD@@ B @-@ filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must start reading text in individual sentences . as a result , the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized if only the first movement is syn@@ thes@@ ized if the language syn@@ thesizer is not supported directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the proposition recognition filter . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , you will automatically add a proposition recognition filter . you may change its settings or add further proposition recognition filter , but will be rounded off . &quot;
&quot; in the easiest way you can learn the setup of the talk selection . turn on the map selection , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ts . turn on the box selection , change some properties , and check out how the reading of the speaker is changing , otherwise you need to set out more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; then faster with the pre@@ reading can begin , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can take very long , &quot;
you will then apply text orders on the map of orders or dis@@ rupt@@ ing if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons , the normal proposition recognition filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed , unless you know what you do . &quot;
&quot; the text of Sat@@ is@@ cross @-@ recognition filter compare text with a regular expression of pun@@ ching and paste a table mark ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the sat@@ in limits are automatically removed from the text ( tab@@ s ) before filtering . please note that the standard of the recognition filter is attached . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD @-@ filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ v ) , war@@ nings , News or the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition filter , you can add this again by adding the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection menu , you can over@@ write the user settings for the application . the card &apos;s card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on cardboard card speaker ) . in other words : no speech properties are specified .
&quot; use of the matching speaker , showing all properties of a furnished speaking speaker . if you don &apos;t want to delete or edit the settings of the speaker . otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts . otherwise , cho@@ oses the spokes@@ man to the most originally set properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the requested speaker features , by clicking on one of the sel@@ ector buttons . &quot;
&quot; here , select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; mark this check@@ box , if the property should have prec@@ e@@ dence over other features . you can also put several markings here . &quot;
&quot; because the language is a critical factor in understanding of the issue , it will always be treated as a pre @-@ level property . this is the only case when you might want to specify the attribute language , if you may know that a certain application was sent into another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all characteristics in the speaker , which equ@@ ates to the below , click on the drop button standard speaker and then use on speaker , which equ@@ ates to the below . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ o crash@@ es immediately if it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer &apos;s crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you &apos;ll need to install G@@ stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , you may attempt to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output of AL@@ SA does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : &quot; &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts in AL@@ SA will occur to prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I loaded an extra voice for festival on the Internet . I have installed it and can use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ o does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices add the new voice . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; at the cardboard card audio there is a setting speed . so that this will work , the SO@@ x program has to be installed and above the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . however , some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ oes like Festival Interactive provide a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is where the HTML will be converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to XML ; ( see ) or if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ ml file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to SS@@ ML @-@ conversion filter , and put up the speed of talk . &quot;
I can &apos;t make it that websites with a female voice read . I have created a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the websites with a male voice .
&quot; at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not work to work . thus , the X@@ SL file acc@@ uses to converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
I have added an own character set filter and now I can go back in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in or return . on the ant@@ ei@@ on@@ ite orders will appear only from a sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; you cannot filter inter@@ section signs ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation marks , comm@@ as and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . do not use filter for this sign instead of a filter detection . &quot;
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is already installed on most systems with &amp; Linux ; ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by using the use of G@@ stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA as well as the audio output . if your system counts as well you can &apos;t play music and start a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes if you want a text order and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
&quot; with stand in July 2005 , the Ko@@ de supports no real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current proposition is still read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs are already included . &quot;
&quot; do you have &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ pack@@ ers archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ packing the tar@@ ball in a matching folder . please switch to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed , or at least only on request . &quot;
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thesizer are made by default . some of them have a running movement of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the configure option shows the configure parameters , which causes the adjustment of the adjustment . &quot;
&quot; the default value is installed as default ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;
&quot; on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that can be translated from sources . &quot;

&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions , which you have received with the syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer ; the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , speed and sound height with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be delivered with festival . if you want to read web pages you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone .
&quot; for these voices you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations at the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice sets the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter a c@@ yr@@ ill@@ ical ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions . look for the festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the coding option has to be adjusted to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding must be adjusted to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; then the festival will take over the le@@ x@@ icals analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; - voices can be downloaded
note that &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; a complete voice setting system is created . &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; generated language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create this slide .

&quot; for this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival , to use &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ votes to voice syn@@ thes@@ es ; -@@ voices are not installed in &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; file folder , but in the folder / lib / . guides you will find under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of Festival for German &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; it is required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; then download MS German Festival
&quot; please find instructions in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , which you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 is not necessary to re@@ comp@@ ile the error correction ) . then add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ s@@ cm . &quot;

command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled in a console input .
&quot; best use a command to send the speech output to a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to audio equipment . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ controller center ; which allows the management of the network interfaces , rout@@ ines and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ controller center ; allows users to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a single , integrated surface . it can be called by K Menu k@@ Control@@ center ; can be called . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , such as other settings from the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; creating a simple surface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ controller center ; module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started through a selection of control center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; k@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be operational and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is shown at all and allows the setup of the network characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers are installed for the network hardware and other devices when installing and installed . network devices will be added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the network settings will be loaded , if the network settings are selected at the &amp; k@@ controller center ; -@@ Index is trying to detect the system used on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform to select the list of distribution and release date . by marking the adjustment of non @-@ once questions , the definition can be met automatically . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be reset automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are illustrated , which means that settings can only be viewed , changing the settings can be displayed on the right bottom of module . it is necessary to enter the password mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three riders : &quot;
the tab interface is used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the rider network interface :
the settings adapted network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click the button to set up in the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings shows the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of automatic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP address will send all the required TCP / IP information at any system start and therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; using Manu@@ ally , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ ates the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialogue are displayed as features of the device in the list box .
it should be ensured that IP address is not already used in the network . using a existing IP address would result in a TCP / IP conflict . you can determine whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on demand or switched off . switching of a network device is done by selecting from the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the required network device , switching from the list and click on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; set the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is present more than one network interface , the interface must be connected to the network in which the Gateway Computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain extension through the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if computers htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , trig@@ gers these names in an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the horse &apos;s name resolution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified .@@ DNS entries can be arranged through selection of a contract , round or gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons or her@@ e@@ under in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button add ... from the group machine for name resolution , a DNS server can add a DNS server . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group machine to name resolution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list of known calcul@@ ator describes computer name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used in first line when bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses will be able to replace this version of IP in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click Add .... The New dialog is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known host and click the button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias names , the button add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known computer from the list and select editing .... The dialog acquain@@ t@@ ame Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings provided in the network settings are not effective immediately . in order to activate the changes , you have to set the following command . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ conf@@ .@@ is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( mostly rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE are installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and download the rpm package ; with rpm , as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface , such as a package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE sufficient for this case ; not , but additionally , the development cooperation with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this will only recommend experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology are given , in the second all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; amended configuration files . &quot;
this area may not replace more knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC will be convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network .
&quot; at present , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . it has never been large spread . IPv6 is expected in the near future . this description focuses on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to provide or , if available , can be used D@@ H@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen as any more ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a small ( home ) network , IP address should be selected from a specially designed area to avoid IP add@@ ressing with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded on the Internet , therefore their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses are usually used in the 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 , which is large enough for networks up to 250 hosts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the standard route is required for the IP training . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . usually , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works as a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the configuration files that are stored by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes changed at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections can be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can be expected . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application with which you can run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system cr@@ on .
&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of suitable tasks and additional environmental variables . if you are using &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this will be available for all users of the system as well as systems in internal tasks . every folder can open and ad@@ joining . &quot;
&quot; in case of de@@ activated task , program name and parameter are not displayed and measured under description appears disabled . &quot;
the environment variables here are the otherwise existing environment variables for all listed tasks except strength . with a de@@ activated variable appears as description disabled .
&quot; to create a new task , first select the tasks -@@ folder . go in the menu to edit New .... alternatively , you can also click on the right mouse button to click on the tasks folder and press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter here the name of the start program . you can call either a relative or an absolute path name . if you want to search the program first , press the program .... &quot;
&quot; choose the minute ( s ) , to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you specify both monthly and week@@ day ( s ) as well as the week@@ day of day ( s ) , the program will be executed at a suitable date as well as at a matching week@@ day , and in addition to every Sunday of the months , no matter what date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes are only active when the cr@@ ont@@ ab is stored . &quot;

&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or supplements of tasks or variables will be active then . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard K@@ DE ; print dialog . if you are looking out , see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
&quot; prints the cr@@ ont@@ ab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users , which possess extended per@@ missions . &quot;
cr@@ on , for example vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the command cr@@ ont@@ ab to change the sched@@ ules of the user . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ S@@ IX con@@ formance &amp; UNIX , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; used standard commands by &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; the ability was to save several archives on a tape on the basis of tar . it has the ability to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer takes it when you are secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat . it can happen on three ways : &quot;
&quot; qu@@ dat , let the band back and reads the pre @-@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recognis@@ es &amp; k@@ dat . if you don &apos;t know the tape on the band , you will be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; realize &amp; k@@ dat . the pre@@ sp@@ ouses , search for the appropriate index on your record . cannot be found if the band index is to be re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol of the tape drives , in order to indicate that the band has been incorporated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the band can now be searched for the band . &quot;
&quot; before dis@@ closure of the banana , initially the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; and dat , through a change of symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger . &quot;
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat it can be used it needs to be form@@ at@@ ted from &amp; k@@ dat .
&quot; a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use data to store data . this process does not have to format the format before using the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually needs to be form@@ at@@ ted . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually needs to be form@@ at@@ ted . flo@@ ppy drives are not necessary , however , DA@@ T drives are not necessary . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity drives &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the band . all data on the band are lost , automatically bound and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you must select the secured files . it can happen on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be secured this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files are stored in the profile specified .
mark files in local file baum with a bun@@ k@@ ets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on the local file @-@ tree , and select the She@@ ep menu ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialogue , you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears to backup . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; mark a file or folder in one of the files for the drive . it will be checked , only the selected file or file . &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a bun@@ k@@ ish . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are checked .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click in one of the archives and select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; once the test is started , the dialog settings will be published . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and check the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can install the restart , the files that are to be restored will be marked . this can be done on two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the record for the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder is recovered . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives using a bun@@ k@@ ish . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are recovered .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for rest@@ oring . in this dialogue , you can check out your selection and change the work folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the band &apos;s inde@@ xed file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can build the index to two types :
this is a safety profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a safety profile :
&quot; the current work folders , in which the backup should be made . the list of secured files will be automatically updated according to the selected work folders . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under the backup files , that only the files are stored in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are on the same file system , can be saved separately under securing files . each entry will be considered by tar ir@@ respective of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file will have been secured , which have been changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which used to determine changes since the last in@@ circle backup is used . &quot;
&quot; del@@ etes the snap@@ shot files before the call of tar . this causes all files secured and create a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup . &quot;
the buttons of buttons files are gt ; and lt ; lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can adjust the settings via the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device node for tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ side version of the band device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is tied to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat to un@@ lock the tape when tape drives . possibly , this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
the option is switched on when sol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically replace the tape . don &apos;t use this option for flo@@ ppy streaming .
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ sided block size for tape drives . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need to know &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive is necessary . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat , a band format , it writes a file at the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n bytes ) The band ID . the format of this string is the name : seconds , with the name of the full name of the system , on which the band is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds , which have passed since the era , in which the band has been form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file using the same name in the file $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar archives that are directly associated with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not related to incre@@ mental f@@ uses . &quot;
check the contents of a backup piece . this icon is only active when a band is integrated .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewer for system protocols . the program is intended for un@@ experienced users , or where you can get information about your system or where the system allows information on your system or where the system allows you to access information about problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the program is intended for un@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system can be stored on the different protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users access fast access to information on problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore , some advanced functions may be filtered and analysed with their help to be filtered and evaluated . &quot;
&quot; in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . among other things , include : &quot;
support for many different types of log files for the Sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included in addition and are explained in the other chapters of this manual page .
&quot; as you see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are available , with whose help the individual protocol lines are easily filters and sort . the individual options to sorting and filtering will be shown in the next chapter of this manual page . &quot;
&quot; after the start tries &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - will not display it , and it opens up instead of a small news window , so you &apos;ll find &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very probably not run with system link right instead of which normal users usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter out after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to filter files . in the default settings , the selection box is displayed next to the display set . in the default settings , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns containing the filter search engine . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry on this site . the character string of the filter search will then select the column process in the correspon@@ d@@ ingly selected column . for example , in the protocol file system protocol , select the name of a process , so it shows &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all the protocol lines are sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage errors are displayed using a more obvious colour than protocol lines . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to display certain processes ( for example in system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process , for example , if you would like to examine the output of a certain commands such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to view all the new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; allows to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage . once you selected a panel , select a protocol on display . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has a homepage on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information on the information sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in addition you will find in the following file of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; K@@ DE ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system develops quickly to the standard for the control of the programming for the high speed of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to avoid a machine on System V in@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ form@@ att@@ ing . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was an in@@ it file . &quot;
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it diff@@ ers from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder / etc are instead directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service , which you will start when changing to another Run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it does not need much use of it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you do not want to run something to do with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel ad@@ diction in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
&quot; the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . in the initial field , you should see one line as the following : &quot;
&quot; at this point , you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can manually edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit continuous , then you can restart the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter it -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory . &quot;
&quot; how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written , that it &apos;s a argument like start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts in the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would hold the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K includes , the script will be called to the argument . if it includes a S , the script will be called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes . I might have a server running , that can run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user @-@ friendly as possible .
use &amp; sy@@ s@@ v ; using a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to say not tri@@ vial : simply drag one entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can change scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by removing it to its original run@@ level ( or its position ) if it does not happen if they withdraw a record from the range of availability systems services .
&quot; note : entries are shi@@ fted when you go to a new area . in order to copy them only on a new run@@ level , you need to select a copy from the menu Edit , and in the target range -- even then , if the same entry has already existed in the target range . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ rows of a entry can sometimes be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the um@@ ber entries before you can try again to add the system service . &quot;
note : currently there are no possibility to restore entries that were cast into the paper basket . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator key to activate the various working ranges ( Available Systems services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of th@@ - or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of one entry manually , press the button key to switch between different fields . connect the dialog button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to refuse the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . otherwise it is available . otherwise , they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise , changes to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ve been experim@@ ented with the Standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts steadily . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the default Run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v , is planning an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution files , please verify that all configuration files are required ( and also if they are within the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache and htt@@ p@@ d ) is simply without news when their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you can use a different distribution , please send me information about Run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
&quot; this documentation rel@@ ates to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage the user and groups of your system . &quot;
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
&quot; after changing changes , you have to save them . either you can use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window is a simple application . the main window consists of two cardboard cards , the user and user list . to edit the user , select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog box or group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have extended system settings . only if you have enabled the limited system settings . if you have limited capacity limit cards , you will be able to make individual settings , if shadow passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card password administration appears if shadow passwords or example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as in BSD , is installed . &quot;
this map is only activated if the limited file system is activated ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be changed for any user parameters and the limited number of data in KB are :
these parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system . the current fil@@ esystem is selected with the help of the field file system .
&quot; the card information provides information about the selected users of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , users can mark the user in other groups by pressing them in the big field . &quot;
the dialog features of the Group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the list you can mark this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu users or group or click on the matching button in tool@@ bar . editing or delete of selected users or the selected group works similar . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can add the li@@ lo boot manager , remove the boot word , remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system , remove the operating system , remove , modify , change operating systems . &quot;
