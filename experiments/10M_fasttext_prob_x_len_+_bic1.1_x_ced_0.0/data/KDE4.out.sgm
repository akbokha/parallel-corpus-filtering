<seg id="481">"unsharpened mask is working on the contrast of the edges look like a picture. in fact, it's not a bit more psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric darkness and it is a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"focus is probably the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. it's a bit more complicated in its use and has various parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitalized pictures need an correction of the sharpness. this is why the digitalization process can be printed along with a common color. this is again that the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more arable sharpening as normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at JPEG image, a camera of internal sharpening has been applied frequently. images in the raw format will always have to be pushed during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can apply a sharpening filter during the reading of the picture. if you disable this deactivate, you get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening case of sharpening. you can call with the menu entry to sharpening sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should get carefully what the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of edges, but also amplifies space. in general, the usable technique can be focused on the sharpening of a picture. in general, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>

<seg id="489">The filter insharp is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">Original picture and preview help the picture edit the picture shows the issue of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values are often good results and should be tried out. an increase in the radius or contemplation increase the effect. if you create the unsharpness mask to make noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius provides how many pixels are affected by the filters. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpest images best in its final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped picture, which is added to the original. thereby, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the wellbeing value is a split from the maximum RGB-value and the default amount of the difference. you can define a minimum difference for a canning of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the killing is excluded and hence beautifull error in faces, heavens and water surface."</seg>

<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be reduced from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation is reduced to the shareholding effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the smoke filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values can be reduced from 0-1. however, values are very bad. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a suitable value is 0.03. a high value is still tolerated."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness Gauß is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you might use a value unequal zero, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of transitional size. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular balance or the Gauss's sharpness. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is framed with only a beam per pixel, different mistakes can occur. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& PovRAY; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the influence of these mistakes. generally speaking images with this feature better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you turn off anti-aliasing, connects & PovRAY; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called great sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& PovRAY; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard, a adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because each pixel is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is constantly split up and adaptive because each pixel is lowered by the calculated colours."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you select the first method, POV-Ray has a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels are processed, both pixels will be calculated with a specific number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth of 4x4 additional points, a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) will be charged extra rays each pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels will be calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays each pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixel, and the maximum depth of the records may be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce aliasing effect is reduced to the generation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the Rays to avoid a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1634">"a collection is a list of MIDI files, which you summarize. these will be played by the series. in this section, how you can use collections efficiently."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"to lay a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find in the menu Collection under the point. Click here on New and give the name for the collection."</seg>

<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the setting of automation to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"when automation is activated for the collection, a piece of opening (using file opening or drag & drop) will be automatically added to the active collection."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"when automatic add to the collection is not activated, the temporarily the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection will then be added to the opening pieces."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"to remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection Manager, select the collection and select the desired song and then click on."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"you can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the sequence after from the submenu of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection."</seg>
<seg id="1646">"if you add songs or remove any random order in the menu, the order will be specified."</seg>

<seg id="1650">"to delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection and click on the button delete."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"the temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this doesn't matter because it is not stored at leaving & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizer that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map general-MIDI events in events that understands synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map which converts all the events of the Changpatch program into Bright piano in events of the Type Change patch to Trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should be playing."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only one sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment, and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite seditor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"a MIDI map is a text file, which stores all the necessary settings for the play of a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. precondition for this is that every occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap... End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end, that the end of a section is reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so I can come in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI is shown on your specific keyboard. the general use is as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of equal sign will be ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and do not change the line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is needed to lay all the tones that requires this instrument to take on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard have no tissues (e.g. with sound 60), you can remove a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (Gun's richer), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that this is meant by the term Trodrum-Patch of the Patch, in which every tone represents a different percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not such, at which the sound means the sound height of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to provide as sounds on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"like the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">"for each channel, you can define several keyboards for each channel and each instrument will have to use different names in the first line."</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to form sound on the perk. channel. look for example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels on others. if you want to exchange the first and second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, depending on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will continue to be defined in the file. if you are using the Forcepatch option, all events will be used to change the patch on this channel. in this case, the patch is still used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the Forcepatch option can be useful for example, to always use the Perkv Patch on the Perkv channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio can be multiplied, in which proportion of Pitch-Bender-events will be multiplied. if so, a MIDI file will be converted to the value of n * (r / 4096) and then it will be redirected to the map n * (r / 4096), thus in the map file no decimal number."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM predictates that a keyboard, which is to play a keyboard, with the value 4096, to play a sound higher. unfortunately, try to find some keyboards up to an octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. in the menu, you can find below settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canal view is a window with a whole number of piano atures (one for each MIDI channel). you can see what sounds just played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the canalan view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the canal view (until now) has two different views to display the played tones. view in the Settings menu, select the Settings menu: settings"</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed, which is played by a song. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down the pace, use the arrows on the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a piece of music has to be played. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc., thus, the same MIDI file may lead to very different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes on very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can not force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the single instruments, speed and etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"that can happen if you have a binary (rpm, Deb) of & kmid. that happens because & kmid; without any AWE support, you need to download a source code and install (for example from kmid; 's home)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributions made many changes and at the same time had corrected many places. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program was used to me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indications that this change was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later a lot of further useful functions were added later.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare fast text, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the same and merging of folders. this function converted & kdiff3; almost in a full-quality file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful if two persons can work independently of one piece of code and can make changes. the original file (the basis) helps to edit the correct result. in this editor, you can even edit the results directly. in this editor, the image shows three Quell files at the merge:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; helps you complete with the same and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in folder-merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and are based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often have code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at a summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble if no one changes the insertion.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is equal, and the other distinguishes in one line, then the color indicates which file different is different. red color means that both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files are the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify the Tipparwork by simply write the file names of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diff3 folder, folder 2 folder, diff3 folder, diff3 folder, folder 3 folder folders"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialogue allows manual type of file names to select a selection via the file browser (file...) or select a last edited file from the list of the folding box. if you do not have a third file, you don't need to specify the third file; if you have to leave the registration for C, the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"select a folder via the button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge file will be selected, for B and C, however, a folder, then uses & kdiff3; the filename consists of A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"when assembling, the input field is active for the target and can be changed. however, it is not necessarily necessary to establish a output file later. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">You can open a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start using the same / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text file. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins, you can easily connect the dialog with the button button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also use bricks and shutdown: simply draw a file from a file manager or selected text from a editor, and let it fall over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains such functions. if you would like to find out how these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would have to compare and compare two appropriate files, and then compare and compare these relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can get nothing out of & kdiff3; only the fallenger text is supported in a comparative window.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program as cutting and insert (instead of copying and insertion). in such a case your original data could go lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part every text window is the info line. the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file names and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse will rest on the line. then a small auxiliary window will show the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source codes are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)"</seg>

(color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files. this is very useful in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"in addition to the text, the merge column is located. when differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + Z. B., white characters are only important in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare individual cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line, which separates the merge column from the text, is interrupted at the places where the respective source file is activated, the line is displayed on broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (under the comparison of the comparison) also has a info line with the inscription:, the filenames and [gechanges] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are dissolved, saving disabled is disabled!!! (use the buttons jumps to the most dissolved / unbreakest conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts.) "</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparisers are used, every difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually."</seg>

<seg id="2315">"navigate mainly with the image running and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you are using in one of the window, you can also use the arrow keys to the right, side, end, Strg-beginning and Strg end, just as you can use it by clicking here."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the Augss window, you can also use the other keys to edit. with the insert button you can switch between insertion and writing mode. (default is the entry mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns is synchronized the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group (as already explained in the assembly and the editable evaluation window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference (Ctrl-picture downwards / strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture downwards) or to the next / previous conflict. therefore you must differentiate between dissolved and unbreakable conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marking in the clipboard, you must automatically copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this is activated, what always you mark will automatically copy to the clipboard and check the manual copy. be careful if you could overwrite the contents of the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line-up will be saved according to the initial operating system. UNIX versions use a line-in-feed-character\, and Win32-based systems use car back-in\\ r\. Kdiff3 reserves the line-down of the source files, therefore you should use & kdiff3; also not with binary files."</seg>

<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written, that it's a argument like start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts in the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K includes, the script will be called to the argument. if it includes a S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set machines for many purposes. I might have a server running, that can run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was so user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Use & sysv; using a mouse or another pointer is easy to say not trivial: simply drag one entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can change scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by removing it to its original runlevel (or its position) if it does not happen if they withdraw a record from the range of availability systems services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are shifted when you go to a new area. in order to copy them only on a new runlevel, you need to select a copy from the menu Edit, and in the target range -- even then, if the same entry has already existed in the target range."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorrows of a entry can sometimes be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the umber entries before you can try again to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there are no possibility to restore entries that were cast into the paper basket. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator key to activate the various working ranges (Available Systems services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to meet a selection of th- or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of one entry manually, press the button key to switch between different fields. connect the dialog button to accept the changes, or press Esc to refuse the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require a confirmation before it will be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"all settings are stored in the $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. otherwise it is available. otherwise, they are stored by & ksysv; otherwise, changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc."</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I've been experimented with the Standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts steadily. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode, then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services are started in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv, is planning an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using a different distribution files, please verify that all configuration files are required (and also if they are within the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache and httpd) is simply without news when their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you can use a different distribution, please send me information about Runlevel, so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"this documentation relates to & kuser; 1.0. with this program, you can manage the user and groups of your system."</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & user; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after changing changes, you have to save them. either you can use the corresponding symbol of the toolbar or the entry Save in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"the main window is a simple application. the main window consists of two cardboard cards, the user and user list. to edit the user, select the desired user or the desired group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog box or group characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"some flashcards are only displayed if you have extended system settings. only if you have enabled the limited system settings. if you have limited capacity limit cards, you will be able to make individual settings, if shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD Unixes."</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card password administration appears if shadow passwords or example / etc / master.passwd, as in BSD, is installed."</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map is only activated if the limited file system is activated (Quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable at the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be changed for any user parameters and the limited number of data in KB are:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be adjusted individually for each file system. the current filesystem is selected with the help of the field file system.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the card information provides information about the selected users of the selected user. the standard group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primur Group. furthermore, users can mark the user in other groups by pressing them in the big field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog features of the Group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the list you can mark this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select from the menu users or group or click on the matching button in toolbar. editing or delete of selected users or the selected group works similar."</seg>
<seg id="3000">"with this module you can add the lilo boot manager, remove the boot word, remove and change the time until the boats of the standard operating system, remove the operating system, remove, modify, change operating systems."</seg>
