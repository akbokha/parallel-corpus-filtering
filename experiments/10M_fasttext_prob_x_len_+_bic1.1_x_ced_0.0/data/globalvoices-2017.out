&quot; although I had visited the USA for at least once a year , I would now live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love of America is extraordinary .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American films to read American authors and run American authors . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist for the American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the Grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of a oil @-@ Magn@@ aten in The Pel@@ ican letter , who had to occupy his interest in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if it &apos;s the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only increased . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country where I have ever lived , whose variety is so inviting , that you are always the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very painful love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is surrounded with his narrow @-@ minded . &quot;
&quot; he never stops with his opinion about the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ american and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes cast , which he won at the Republi@@ can election , was the highest number ever nominated by the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ rot person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I could not meet Tr@@ ump and his voters in harmony with people that I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , Professor Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , the people from all over the world , a deep believing man , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ um@@ ps world@@ view did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights for life long , and her husband Dave , my host family that treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; it fits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped with much patience and arro@@ gan@@ ce , and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump met his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a halt and the equivalent to its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the argument with the idea that men voted for Tr@@ ump , because they were either aware of his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were ready to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to describe the tr@@ ump voters as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superf@@ icial and respec@@ tful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those that act on another way , and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most know , are voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that it has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they may say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look differently . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( s ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; Word Game from white to the White and whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones called it exactly what America has made so magnificent . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always have , America is everyone welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; with the election Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with vers@@ eness , religion freedom and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at Ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a job change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have been my son , Captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; he asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; clo@@ aked the crowd . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would someone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN &quot; !
Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God is thanks to Mr. Tr@@ ump is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , the message said . &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find no place in this new America .
and that breaks me my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero Church in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean City Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played in both sites , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
&quot; music , which lives with the waste &quot;
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an ancient colonial city which is very popular with the tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now the La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) plays in the community : one of children and adults , existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has been found with their musical instruments , an opportunity to overcome them . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the church , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mex@@ ic@@ os , is known for their drug abuse and the Ban@@ den violence . &quot;
but this changed after an acci@@ dental meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hop@@ el@@ iness .
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI comments : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to reflect their great passion . &quot;
&quot; always come and play with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital - on instruments which are made from recovered waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ prepared instruments which consist of local fixed waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , saxophone , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trumpet and drums . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ an and Latin American music and music of the Beatles , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Chávez remembers a local o@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place , where the parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was something that he had never seen before : a her@@ bage produced from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra , which plays on instruments from recovered material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world creates approximately one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who are with him and of him are the Tro@@ uble - like the people in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectac@@ le from gar@@ bage @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
&quot; these East African countries show how technology and team work can fight illegal fishing successfully , &quot;
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that is targeted on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release happens during an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices in common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already been operated by the Iber@@ ian waters , illeg@@ itim@@ ate fishing before the other coast of Africa was sought . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ingly raised over accordingly , and not incl@@ ined to welcome a criminal law of this kind to their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fish@@ eries authority . he is part of a team that discovered the ship wre@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was removed from the waters of the region : it was not successful to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , for pl@@ undering of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects against criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; alongside Somalia and Madagascar members , the members of this network were driven out by the six countries that were driven out of their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we have eight countries who are working together and work together . they will change information and stand mut@@ ually illeg@@ ally , where to get illegal fishing companies , &quot; says Tony Long , head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is by definition not regulated : what is caught , is hidden , absent for it extremely difficult to track . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing systems can damage , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled through bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the snow @-@ emp@@ iri@@ o , the actions between individual countries , these actions happen in real @-@ time , tra@@ ce@@ able to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists existing licenses , news to susp@@ icious activities or details that you noticed during a port inspection or experience . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they move on the open sea with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this enables the authorities to mark the ships , which are in banned areas . even so susp@@ icious passes can be discovered - such that a ship invites his fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly , if they have a criminal law . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing are likely to be able to accept such ships in their ports . what does the ships cannot be sold in their ports , and that they may even be forced to pay the numbers of pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owners , which means that illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally not worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to reach , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Senior Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a Ber@@ ater@@ o company that has been set up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ ISH @-@ i every year because of illegal fisher@@ man who penet@@ rate Eastern African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms , which attracts the world &apos;s commercial fish catch from all over the world . among these also sel@@ fish@@ eries . &quot;
&quot; these practices include promotions , such as sailing under false flag , fake license documents , inscription of ph@@ asi@@ en@@ ames , fish protected species and fish in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are targeted by the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fishing illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You won &apos;t run my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; and exactly this leg@@ ale hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i .
so far the closed front work .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 examinations . &quot;
&quot; it has been uncovered against criminal networks , which had fake licenses in Tanzania . discovered ships , which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and found it wing@@ ed ships and found . &quot;
&quot; due to his cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , international authority to fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances and receive . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our examinations take us quite far in the &quot; &quot; organised crime &quot; , &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , which is to help F@@ ISH @-@ i susp@@ ects more precise ships . &quot;

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which will always be developed further , helps to bring illegal ships to hide themselves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal fisher@@ man use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; said Duncan Cop@@ eland , Music analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO , which also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , allowing them to be ort@@ able anymore by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system , which connects different information on information . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African Nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who is doing what is doing - that makes simply sense , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to combine together and their resources for the investigation . &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run as a global system the persecution of ships .
&quot; there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel criminal , but also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships , previously f@@ ished without licenses and hardly to calculate consequences , are now aware that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i have now counted a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover , since then fishing boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i started to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board to@@ wing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries have also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we will now also copy other countries &quot; , &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we will disappear several hundred million dollars a year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . now they fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; safety is the goal , even more such initiatives and structures will also be created in other regions . &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia had its first big triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to use bad networks , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time , the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative work mode works for the protection of the oceans .

&quot; their article will appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , T@@ ED Education , New York Times and The Guardian . location in Venezuela has spread further to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of rec@@ iting the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to be a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum for the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government had denied the opposition to the opposition to the opposition , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes were the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country by taking them on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments against them .
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ lands Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north @-@ located Bundest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ part@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deteri@@ or@@ ates continuously , what is noticeable in the everyday life of Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans through a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity of the current president Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro saw the chance for a fundamental change ; ultimately it was blocked by a re @-@ election of official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises the context of the government &apos;s context in this context : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , which includes the inflation rate in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum to withdraw its institutional structures and close to a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Party ) , in which the demonstr@@ ators were planned to join the National Assembly on October 27th as well as a march to the Mira@@ flo@@ res government , the Venezuel@@ an government , scheduled to continue on November 3 , should continue to continue implementing the refer@@ end@@ ums to the offices . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , a nationwide civil strike and on November 3 , all to Caracas to the Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the Action Program &quot; The Return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the March@@ es , published in real time , bear witness among other things a overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen and supporters of the government . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell about con@@ cre@@ ations , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially great waves beat the message on police supp@@ ression in the central @-@ north @-@ located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; the protest@@ ers went back to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ staat ( T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira ) : &quot;
&quot; women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not carry any skirts , because one could see something else , what many nation@@ alities do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , a Inf@@ ographic is already making round , which constitutes the extent of supp@@ ression every day : &quot;
so the dictatorship was supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had asked the validity of a call for a minister in question - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many many people in the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs include :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your minister !
on the road !
&quot; other values were doing this protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which has taken a little against the devastating economic crisis , and has rather been busy for critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the fairy tal@@ es always take more than frequencies and intensity .
&quot; some vene@@ ers reported media , they were to be hungry to participate in a strike , rather than to work or go shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine City of Cordoba . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , he said in the province of Córdoba against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were committed to crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the burden , same names as his father carry up to the brutal military ro@@ per@@ ations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , has suffered enough . &quot;
he kept his family secret for 34 years .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t know that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not recognize that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ie@@ ter . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , his father was a commander of the secret service division of 141 in prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the history of Luis Qui@@ x@@ ano , the oppressed , who was accused of ab@@ duction in 158 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had witnessed the magn@@ itude of the atro@@ cities , which he had experienced as a boy , and testified before a Federal Court against his own Father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has become a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been married with a boy , who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and called me to identify my boy@@ friend . &quot;
he said :
you are an ass@@ hole that you are delighted with one of the ERP .
&quot; only that they don &apos;t have one day , and I must save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the Military Arm of the Revolutionary Workers &quot; Party of Argentina . &quot;
therefore he prohibited me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me with the work on the military base .
&quot; he told me , I would be secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be fine . for that , my father had taken me . &quot;
&quot; on the base point I had to destroy papers , who had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : Universitäts@@ ab@@ sions , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , Prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ then the prisoners are tortured &apos; .
my father took me a total time to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; at first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to increase . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - simply everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small blanket wrapped in a blanket , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down and maintained me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he appeared to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
I saw in and saw a lying lying on the people .
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that they fortified the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just lying there . &quot;
&quot; they grab@@ bed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ threw him with water , pursued a load of 220 Volt in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the gest@@ ank there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ del .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were har@@ med . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pe@@ z , a civilians who was also accused in the trial ) and I used the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses which were naked people with the face down - all were in hands and feet .
&quot; in the nearby people , people silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoner , he said , &quot; What do you look like that , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why didn &apos;t you brought me ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a dit@@ ch and killed by soldiers and buried .
&quot; I know this , because my father told her home . &quot;
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms have been described as offices . &quot;
&quot; I know , &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man and killed there . &quot;
&quot; according to the survivors of the civilian population , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process , was accused of students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of the La Per@@ la memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way that you come in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned as part of the process of discover@@ ies a number .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came to be re@@ located . &quot;
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of its cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things back home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; war@@ fare &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it was clear to me that war yield is a b@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military marks which one oppos@@ e an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you enter into a house and the fridge , the record players , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is not a war@@ fare but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , could join with this V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once , he called me a crime and I answered : and you who asc@@ end car to the street ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded anger , struck me , and cried , &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , I will find you and bring you alone . &quot;
we don &apos;t need any other one !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the trial , I showed a photo of that time , where I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home . &quot;
&quot; then , the defense accused me to have been a complic@@ ity in this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to say . &quot;
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the l@@ che is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act &apos; .
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel sorry . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one has only children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; it is further developed and det@@ ects , that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you did ex@@ amp@@ y so during the dictatorship of the dictatorship , but what the bodies of the dead do disappear ? &quot;
why do children carry out ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just have to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but what their bodies may disappear ? &quot;
&quot; were these people not even families , which could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
the disappearance of glue is the last ab@@ hor@@ ous act that one can do a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was again introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the remains of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and somewhere - no idea , where . &quot; you will never find something , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but anything remains forever .
I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
only to clari@@ fy it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the idea to show my father , arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I did his accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ med me and asked me what the entire patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were really good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you have killed people !
&quot; you have committed terrible crimes , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; Well , I show me . &quot;
I did that .
&quot; in 2010 , I filed the first ad . &quot;
I had finally recognized that he was a criminal .
nobody can t@@ oss me that I &apos;m vo@@ iced . I finally said against my own father .
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest , standing before the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; he was indicted for 416 crimes : among them severe , illegal confin@@ ement in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 such serious cases , torture with subsequent deaths in five cases and a case of ab@@ duction of one under 10 years of child . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish rules of judgment .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended for crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppressed of crimes against humanity were found guilty of crimes against humanity , and the court ruled in 28 cases of prison sentences and in nine cases of detention between 2 and 14 years . in six cases it was acqu@@ itt@@ al . &quot;
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder ; torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ warm state terrorism
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military personnel , former police officers , and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped and taken away by his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set up the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; the Tribunal is a historical milestone for all human rights organisations , who have worked for the victims for many years . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research took over 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , so that a memorial was established there , which is now led by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes elderly people in Kyoto - &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors at a center in Kyoto , where one can leng@@ then his driving licence . &quot;
the photo was widespread in social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can extend its driving licence in which one of the last month witnesses were a very mis@@ erable translation in the last month . &quot;
&quot; in a sign , the Japanese word ( section no . 10 ) , which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , unfortunately - maybe even with ar@@ gues back &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; was translated . &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was published on electronic advertis@@ ements in the input area and the building itself . &quot;
works of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine which was widely divided into social media .
&quot; the mistake was the translator Julian Holmes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers carefully . &quot;
the K@@ YO@@ TO Shim@@ bu@@ n daily wrote in K@@ YO@@ TO :
&quot; how could it be to such an English translation ?
this proves nobody has read the translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ correct English translation was first removed . the name &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate drivers &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto &apos;s police was ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been published in the text that was tested by the translator , and that the translation was not checked before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows on the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that elderly people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ cast News was something more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; has been den@@ ounced as an un@@ reasonable description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents nationwide . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture , for example , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens in 2005 . this is equivalent to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens accounted for 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of seniors caused in@@ adequate accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the renowned reporter did not appear in the version of Article Comments to the Light , showing the pre@@ judi@@ ces some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo above the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) about reality not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; so wrong is the translation right , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that a real translation error is . &quot;
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; spread in Asia so widespread
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation failed are mani@@ fold .
&quot; to translate , one requires two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in our native language . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the previous language - native language . &quot;
so a French native speaker was translated from English to French in French - not by the French into English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may be based on lack of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively low number of English speakers that are Japanese to learn . &quot;
&quot; some companies that have no foreign employees cannot be finished . then the Japanese staff , whose English @-@ knowledge is considered the best to be considered to be a translator , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widely distributed - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ens and en@@ ig@@ matic phr@@ ases that arise through machine translation , show that this technique can not substitute for long any human trans@@ lators . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulation in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic pressure prints , which often uses T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only from st@@ ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may still be harmless as jewellery still acceptable , or at least harmless . but from big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected . &quot;
the Kyoto &apos;s Kyoto uses a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and c@@ ens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , the 7th of April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users , they had no access to the online station Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet connection from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV would not be available anymore . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out recordings of protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ positi@@ onal groups , which contradi@@ cted the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was stuck , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an providers are again locked .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ itated on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission on telec@@ oms threatened them with fin@@ es and closure , when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission said this as &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and inform@@ ational national television channels , I have registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IN subsequently confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a locking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly passes their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier research projects of the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local internet providers can use DNA . these are a technique by which the DNS servers will answer certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by DNS , the server reply faulty or ref@@ uses to request a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v and @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed live in Caracas . &quot;
Flo@@ res was defeated and was housed in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government is regulated by Internet connections : in order to keep access to multi @-@ media coverage of access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will become slaves to receive a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child of Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness testimony of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , who were exactly how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a short report , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly auth@@ orization of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a budget in which they were not living together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from the university , she returned to the house once again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride on them . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . when Cri@@ ad@@ itas is known to work in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money is over their under@@ age of money or their under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in the exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned , however , that the children do not have to work for countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and abuse of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t raise . &quot;
&quot; this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , in Paraguay due to its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered witness , sp@@ elled and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to mention things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude , which is vacc@@ inated to the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general not silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , there is the family that their daughter is in faith to improve their training in society and can make something of themselves &quot; something out of themselves , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which the girls can asc@@ end up and whose exploitation is justi@@ fying by faith that they would have no chance to get any training , and maybe even be hungry . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even learn them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon which has been held in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , became a vision . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú joined the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of he@@ el . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of the former military agent Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an officer at the residents .
&quot; Mar@@ ín lived in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira struck with a stick to Mar@@ ín until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they emphas@@ ized that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
&quot; organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep practice in the par@@ agu@@ an society , the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go practice responsible for the death of the girl . &quot;
they signed the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest together and demanded that there was no other Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it &apos;s very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married couples and nearly 60 civil society organisations called a gener@@ ational investigation on the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girls who had their Cri@@ ad@@ ita to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín will be landmark - if the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case from Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to judgment . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited for workers , they live also isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , he had to register , and lost their father . &quot;
&quot; her brothers had to go all working and started to sell on the road , or on the market sweets , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , they had to share the time so that you stayed for learning again . &quot;
&quot; she arose every morning at five o &apos;clock , and prepared the breakfast for their employer . &quot;
&quot; on Fri@@ days for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at an end , she went home again and had time to learning . &quot;
&quot; the more time she was ready with learning , the more leisure had her . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had never been hungry , but got no unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the master &apos;s library as food out of the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the master of the master , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al party , held during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was part of the opposition from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; next to the end of the house of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial of opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he held them for intelligent , but did not instru@@ ct her with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard about politics while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were the opinion that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , who would speak back to their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which she would have allowed to lose , explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated in the school . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ban@@ anas where Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt particularly obvious that I was one group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society cheapest the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group in which one can show career opportunities for cleaning staff and children &apos;s cities in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the Group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ en@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city council in the As@@ unci@@ on district . &quot;

&quot; in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) and the Spanish conqu@@ erer was subjected to them that many girls and boys were still willing to cope with the Spanish conquest of slavery . therefore , it is not willing to justify that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , where it is easy for abuse and exploitation . &quot;
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to the understanding of the phenomena known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
&quot; bill to register Egyptian users social media , to register in the government &quot;
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian Parliament recently submitted a bill to vote on the regulatory conditions in terms of use and commercial social networks .
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , users and users have to register social media in Egypt with an government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up to use an auth@@ orization to share social media to citizens . &quot;
&quot; within six months with acceptance of the law , user should have to register their users with their right names and number sign numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do this , so that could bring a penalty of up to six months in jail or a fine of money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs , and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; every application that is going on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video recorder and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is assumed , as the design will not be imposed on how Egyptian authorities are to make the user account that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ler , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the Legisl@@ ation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user users and users received a user name and a password to get through the Fire@@ wall that blocked Facebook . &quot;
&quot; that could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary to submit information on their identity , to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts from the site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German @-@ Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : research Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R ) : &quot;
&quot; I have strongly encouraged the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things , which have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are violent physical public and private spaces that could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , it means that they will apply a strong surveillance system to filter citizens to monitor a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people , and to carry them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft of the Parliament must first be discussed at the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Board . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and forcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military mind in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and assured that no down@@ stream aging is present on the image area , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Parliament of the Parliament , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a criminal law against cy@@ ber crimin@@ ality , in which a life imprisonment for those intended to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger Leop@@ ards , which are growing through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to wild oxen , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat , as they are always less spo@@ ils . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and the health and growth of the ecos@@ ystem depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented by the nor@@ theastern Japan , daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o who have reached progress made in the last six years to revi@@ ve the life of those who were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture , had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring preventive Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture has already experienced a nuclear accident , already on that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from local point of view which progress has been reached after six years to rebuild the lives of local support .
the detailed report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese revival authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves .
&quot; the housing estate in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ata &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( par@@ agra@@ phs , sa@@ c , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could see the greatest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could be completed here . 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , whereas about 70 percent is the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the cat@@ astrop@@ hic , evacu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ u ) has also been trying to re@@ locate in final spare parts for six years . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Beh@@ el &apos;s accommodations . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such housing . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful in 2011 . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated people were moved to stay in detention centers . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the disaster , have opened its doors to December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fish@@ eries har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , only 30 percent of fish@@ eries ports have resumed its operation in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures agricultural land , have dra@@ gged a large extent in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land areas , with only 66 percent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the ar@@ able land used in Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of cultivated fields of Fukushima , lie in the &quot; nuclear wave zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , the tourism has recovered far back , but here remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again up to 90 per cent at the same stand as before the accident . Fukushima , however , can only be 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ated people . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and , as you will find themselves towards the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in her introduction to the article , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the local population in experience .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local people have taken action , have taken action to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of the respondents say that still not enough to have done enough cat@@ astrop@@ hes health prevention . &quot;
&quot; as it stands for those , that had to be evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture &quot;
&quot; in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacu@@ ated Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; Fukushima had not only experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident , which had to be experienced in Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated people from Fukushima , almost 63 000 people were registered in the areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima , in permanent replacement homes . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home @-@ pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ od , most of the evacu@@ ees are still working in Beh@@ el &apos;s accommodations . it is known that the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects are to be competing for building projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will be held in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people met people from other countries , who speak another language , the differences must first be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; however , after a while , one can see that a more links when it appears on the first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , our perspectives expand and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we will receive topics that often get less attention when reporting . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Veron@@ iki Kri@@ con@@ i speaks about the common@@ alities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ i explains how the love of music worked to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time , where she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experience which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to intensive care station last week : a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia was defeated by a demonstration against the head in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , a protest rally against austerity . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , a social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and put it into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local portrait journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread quickly in Brazil for a few days .
&quot; the image is also recogni@@ zable in the pictures of the police officer , which was identified with a stroke . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o has been suspended until the end of the investigation into the case of the active service . &quot;
&quot; the pictures show the police officer , as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officer would be up from a demonstr@@ ators and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would thus be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of Media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z recorded video in the web , where you can see how Mat@@ eus attacked from the police officer and to share several sanitary shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective film , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the below shown clip , one can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while being in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for more violence against activists in the memory of Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experiencing a wave of political violence : here , activist Guil@@ d Irish is murdered by his father because he was sabot@@ aged the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , which has been attacked by a polic@@ eman , who attacked him with a stroke stock . &quot;
police Invest@@ ments
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where they came to demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators in the last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were set up a stage for speakers in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ fin and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police to refra@@ in force against demonstr@@ ators against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media road prot@@ ested the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window disc . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported a targeted glass windows specifically to illustr@@ ate their cover pages in order to illustr@@ ate their cover pages .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title @-@ story with one in a brand . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window , more than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special deal . &quot;
&quot; this must also recognise , if one is strict against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives a absurd , disp@@ rop@@ or@@ tion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are ob@@ sc@@ ured by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on the con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Law of Á@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - known that there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were laid out in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the proceeds , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to re @-@ inv@@ ent .
some changes work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ itting comm@@ itting daily to the factories , which still grin@@ d . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a solo@@ ist veter@@ an that is rising every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis is rough in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar cane factories , which are back in operation after a long time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al , I would receive the sugar ro@@ duction plant , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already with@@ stood the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are already no new . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cand@@ y industry switched off ?
the old platform of the village saw already better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was a economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dated , and hardly any competitive for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
&quot; they only left the factories , which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) . &quot;
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the surcharge on the global market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agriculture and Food Organization . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day is to go down with safety in history , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of re@@ structure in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the dis@@ closure of a total of 98 sugar imports , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is talking about the closure of the factory , the word which he repe@@ ats the most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to receive the place , they formed a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first race year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; officially related documents were officially registered , which would only be differenti@@ ated concerning the parts that would be removed , the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister was able to appro@@ ve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters came increasingly more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the use of sugar imports . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for the retirement in another facility that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will , at the de@@ commissioning of the factory , at whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part that he removed , he dis@@ counted one of his 31 working years . &quot;
&quot; the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace , was dropped . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for jobs and services have been created in the municipalities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then President in the eyes of the present person saw that he had no longer run in operation for the areas where their factories had no longer run in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by the bare . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the parish of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al I learned that many things change , but not always getting better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said , when they began to place them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the street , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were shared to spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used to supply the municipality . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; in the old soldiers , Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty will bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Yahweh N@@ ene , a man of black skin , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a tra@@ ct@@ ant person , yet he gives the lies that they told him not . &quot;
they tor@@ ment it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in retirement , not because it is lacking in strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

you@@ ths of First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they do with Hip @-@ Hop thanks to a series of mig@@ rat@@ ory workshops .
&quot; since 2014 , as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , we have been creating mobile studio studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live . &quot;
the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ e @-@ communities and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The North@@ Stars .
&quot; the workshop will thus increase the young participants in our conversations , such as cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable , or whatever it comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; for example , this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ ec@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway in tears , &quot; to which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were wan@@ ing or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely irrelevant .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ aska Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to conv@@ ey , how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters do not always rule the languages of First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ ician Cre@@ e First nation , the refra@@ in is sung at Cre@@ e . &quot;
the students involved here received some help by Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop Group to give them a St@@ rop@@ he in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; at the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the st@@ rop@@ he is available , as well as translation into English , translated here to German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever interested in me ?
but I try to continue my days on earth
&quot; that is the day , in which you will take our cry &quot;
because we lost our way in life as youth
&quot; but I believe , that we will rise in one day . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow up and also to go ahead of our youth
&quot; so , they can do this , for which she determined the Creator ? &quot;
&quot; in the commentary line , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also provides a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ scription ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) : &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed close to the entrance sho@@ ck@@ hin san@@ pi@@ u ( no . 10 . , &quot; Plast@@ ics Models of dishes &quot; ) by every food that will be served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes at and decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of this plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small enterprises that produce the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders , documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a , over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most Japanese are these plastic dishes so usually that they don &apos;t even turn them once more . a new trend , however , trans@@ forms into current mobile phones and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ck@@ ball . &quot;
&quot; now in special sales : new with plastic decor@@ ations made mobile phone tapes , such as they are displayed in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ d refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is increasingly being more complicated .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ ans @-@ don ( a popular travel shell with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile support . &quot;
for these tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
&quot; and here is an apple , holding your mobile phone : &quot;
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight to coma .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile @-@ designers allow you to create your own work of artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or laugh@@ ing is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with laugh@@ ing ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form to surprise their colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile support has the shape of melting the ice .
&quot; in addition , rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and handi@@ crafts from dried salmon are also available . &quot;
&quot; more quir@@ ky plastic dishes can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter on the h@@ ash@@ tag # 17 . , no . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , this video gives you an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is devoted to the popularity of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ck@@ hin san@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against the organized crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking , &quot; in Mexico , the contra@@ sts and ge@@ aring regularly emerge only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug abuse as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or to the communities that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each strip , behind every bone in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be used . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican News Portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico is called the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with drug traff@@ icking , &quot; ) which should give a voice to these victims and reports the stories between en@@ forcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organis@@ ational crimes can not only be afraid to fear our lives .
the imp@@ lications are much deeper .
&quot; for example , if businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and many municipalities therefore have to drive many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( german : &quot; as fear lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who is seeking every weekend secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who lost their father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have asked us to get rid of and to the graves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electro@@ business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also here with me . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , she has no income . &quot;
&quot; you are the insurance of my Father &apos;s insurance , but they don &apos;t get paid out because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; editors why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and state guidance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; this post reminds us that violence should never look as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
&quot; for some years , illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism have been known . &quot;
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which can actually come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from the specialists . &quot;
it brings me out the version .
sometimes I feel the feeling of whether I am the only one that was attached or sad . it seems like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body .
&quot; I can &apos;t be in@@ effective , or consider this as normal . &quot;
she writes on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that people will hear songs on the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone , and those who have fear that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories are to blo@@ wn numbers in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village might be justified , that they were able to rise . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to interv@@ ene that they are sp@@ ared from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote this post &quot; &quot; Four Mon@@ ths &quot; &quot; in the main city district : like a family with threats of threats , until they were not only destroyed the business until they had torn apart their families . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and remember how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain will never die , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again , when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the more we are removed , the better . &quot;
it included their report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will conduct you or kill . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in those dre@@ ad@@ ful days , if weeping would dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answers is no , because I have to learn how to live . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega released the contribution , &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of the most distinguished generation . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
what is it like to grow up in a settlement in the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about her . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he himself had to teach , how to make an egg , potatoes , potatoes , tortillas warm , and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that makes them live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left side - one for each year of life .
&quot; but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and he had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
&quot; but this was not the day , in which his childhood ended . &quot;
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , who had been shot by bloody LEICA , who had been shot by armed men . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , when violence was missing by the organized crime and the struggle with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of civil servants for public security and government government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secution covered 3@@ 103 murders per day . this corresponds to average 8.5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just some of thousands of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the soul of the country . &quot;
&quot; only few stories live in view of new headlines , but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; the aim of making complex information behind the failed fighting against drug traff@@ icking , that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades , in understand@@ able way . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words , &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages , which he understands , contain pictures , on which violence is depicted . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ or to un@@ mask a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years that the first time emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in front of seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to illustr@@ ate trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in termin@@ ology by Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny not the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting on events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it thro@@ ws questions about our desire to messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tan@@ ker led the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people were killed . &quot;
&quot; following the civil war in Africa , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically there fell victim to the tan@@ ker car .
&quot; the government representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses included , including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the soccer World Cup . &quot;
houses for@@ get@@ ed and hol@@ low cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the imp@@ ord@@ ability .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Mehr@@ ing photos of the incident make the grey scenes this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stolen bodies that are str@@ ing@@ ed on the ground while people are looking at .
but here the story doesn &apos;t end her end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been recre@@ ated several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but certainly not in the context of trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 the fighter of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ one .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities in front of which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a resident on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the army camp at Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the picture from the DR Congo appeared once again , as proof for the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of false ten@@ ders ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further bring personal comments , such as the picture from the DR Congo , with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments . &quot;
the San@@ ge image also occurred in conjunction with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations , those who flee battles , rape and some dead , some caused by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , poets like the following on which these descriptions brought together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , which was wr@@ ong@@ ly maintained by President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an Being , monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to illustr@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be called here . &quot;
&quot; other Intelligence Organ@@ iz@@ ations , the AFP and their source , had also attributed to Th@@ an His statement , but did not allow the image of DR Congo in connection . &quot;
&quot; the global operating range fal@@ sely , &quot;
&quot; traces of these false coupling amounts to the years 2011 and 2012 , and actually coming from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; moving picture @-@ search , &quot; you can see how far the limits can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; a reverse photo @-@ search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images below 18,@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) , which are very similar to the picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixed mas@@ ch private sites , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have attempted to un@@ mask the fake . &quot;
&quot; we have noticed examples of the mis@@ use use and it was linked to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . therefore , we want to represent the range of clear@@ er than by language alone . &quot;
several examples of im@@ pregn@@ able use can come from the listed countries ( which in some cases were also connected to each other ) .
&quot; here are some cases , which can now be completely divided ( on the map in orange ) : &quot;
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of false cop@@ h@@ ings of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries show pages or server using the examples of counter@@ f@@ eit@@ s or fal@@ se@@ ers are still available .

&quot; a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;

&quot; this post which addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo does not show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page claimed that President of Myanmar Th@@ an His 2012 cleared that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story with the image of San@@ ge together .
the article has been updated 2014 and at the time of this release the picture remains in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article by students about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Kath@@ y Har@@ am &apos;s news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , expressly declared that the picture is not taken from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ ag@@ ic attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in circulation in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria bur@@ ns the world sleeps ) .
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion of Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the port of Charlie Heb@@ do massacre in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were these events , which took part in the name of the Islam@@ s , had a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was clou@@ ded as proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages that were thus connected , were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the target was to raise attention to the relative number of dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre in circulation , discussion forums like this here in Vietnamese and declared it to the counterfeit . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the picture from the DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner &apos;s mission@@ aries and Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further examples of a defective use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; also , on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye , but are no longer tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entry with UR@@ Ls and time / dat@@ est@@ amp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and occasionally they have paintings in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , that only appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( frames ) , which these po@@ sts go through . the first frame is focused on religion . &quot;

a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion , and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can &apos;t give this images longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are some people who have un@@ intended to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; considering this mood of the false and counterfeit information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and lubric@@ ates it to the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example , for example ) . &quot;
&quot; an argument is that it is rest@@ rained from images of a turn@@ table to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even requested by the victims itself . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern that non@@ violent pictures and viewer des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ise and to give them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy for example , this study which searched for violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is quite a lot regarding non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact fact that it is essential for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; they are thoroughly understood about the situation in which a picture may suggest something that actually can be used in context or completely mis@@ used species . &quot;
&quot; however , an investigation of false ten@@ ders should also take into account as internationally as internationally . &quot;

&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. un@@ mistak@@ able ) stri@@ ves to offer language thr@@ illed a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to be translated . &quot;
&quot; such words there are in each language , you press certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these un@@ translated words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese acid ) and others who were ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish s@@ lim@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of an easy translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes a bit context is required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT of V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Look to your parents in recognition of it , as in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik Language , spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after walking in cold days in the sun .
&quot; in Bir@@ ds &apos;s words , from his blog over : &quot;
&quot; they escape other cultures , reveal other ideas and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , as we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of this &quot; un@@ translated &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by in@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to invite their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; like Sri Lanka with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade , &quot;
the island State of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally released at the end of May , the rivers , Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement of the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people were killed because of floods and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 304 secure stays of residence . &quot;
&quot; the rainfall left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water states in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene relations of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected area and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give a impression of the magn@@ itude of the flood catastrophe :

many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly flu@@ ent wor@@ sen the den@@ gue crisis , the Save the Children , after further rainfall are already on the road . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations , and five are made for transport of emergency deliveries in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start@@ ups have also explained to help .
&quot; Facebook pages , such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ ing- Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water supply and humanitarian aid . &quot;

&quot; in addition , they led a &quot; SOS &quot; key that had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue actions for flood water and land@@ slide . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population Sri Lan@@ kan , with which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bringing residents in need in need of safety and help assistance to help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; use of .@@ Dam@@ as in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I confi@@ de her four years old daughter , familiar with me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we have still called slo@@ gan@@ s for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we add rights to trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound out of a American flag , others , slo@@ gan@@ ing slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things concern not you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not the Muslim ? &quot; &quot;
I already managed this conversation .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar that they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they mus@@ cled me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we practic@@ ed our religion .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different kind . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is well designed in our collective not@@ ion that as soon as Muslims I don &apos;t want to clean up there .
Dis@@ pos@@ ing to be mi@@ zed
I am not doing this alone .
it &apos;s even happened to the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images come in the sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in Western imagination , religion was deleted , as well as from among the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduced images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ ised by Western books for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this appe@@ aling image language is determined by the dark man you should fear , and the exotic woman that you should save . &quot;
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said broke the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also stand up today .
&quot; moreover , our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood still remains . &quot;
&quot; I have been working thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , in@@ correct nar@@ r@@ ative of the news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely overs@@ ha@@ dow the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women carry on it to carry their head@@ scarf in public buildings , to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same medal . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ vely weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it looks like that the first Muslim prayers were spoken to American soil by Afri@@ kan@@ ers who had been killed here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ set force of deep and fla@@ wed , that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are aimed at the target of anti @-@ milit@@ arily attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and due to the way we tell you , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the nar@@ rati@@ vely of the 1.7 billion .
and we have failed where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree of &quot; religious group in America .
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; at that time when Khan remembered the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ affected Muslims and Americans . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born in the Muslim Church as I was four years old when I was four years old , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they turn back to the following concepts : believe , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavi@@ ours are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , I would see my neighbor in the surf , that I &apos;m afraid of the 15 @-@ metre @-@ concrete and air that could separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the whole evening rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I like her to my poor , and you are called the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and the Q@@ ello . &quot;
I repeat each of them three times .
&quot; therefore , I ask that they are protected from evil , evil , which one can see and evil , which cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; Muslim means to be the prayers , which she had said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; the Muslim Brotherhood exists in it , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire , &quot; which was founded a company with the name of ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , has it a profound meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story I was not aware of what I was so old , as I was my daughter now , but those who have made me to be an un@@ changeable Muslim . &quot;
things I have left for a break in my speech in my speech .

&quot; we must ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of whose , consci@@ ously and un@@ aware of the &quot; others . &quot; as it did my girlfriend and in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , we have no pre@@ sidents in which we already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; to others , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; expl@@ aining of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , under the use of CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can I give it a possibility here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) , the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported a brief statement about Steven Bird &apos;s other initiative , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get the language diversity of great cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land , where T@@ LS has been carried out events in the United States , where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project are :
&quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided , if we do cities , accept diversity - safe spaces , in which inhabitants don &apos;t have to be forgotten . &quot;
&quot; while listening , often these events are often associated to understand , instead &quot; the listening to appreciate , to be able to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers enter their history first in their own language and then declare it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation will lead to the listeners . &quot;
&quot; they call , laughter and emotions , be the language no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; for example , the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate will also take the opportunity to explain the customs of stories for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ able of H@@ oses and the P@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after having explained the importance of his findings , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it that you don &apos;t understand a audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he shares his sense of exclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have heard !
they were attentive ...
they were very with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and the organis@@ ers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can organise with T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers .

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue their campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , dedicated an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ ri@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist of the German @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara Ru@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ dies ( The cost of freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is licensed under @-@ free , contains a number of essays that deal with the free culture in the face of the oppression . &quot;
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it says : &quot;
&quot; this book wants to discuss how mot@@ ions for free knowledge can be built , and what the true cost is associated with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , developer and authors who have involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked on page to look over the fog that gives our news@@ feeds to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and ac@@ claimed internet volunteer who has been detained since 15 March 2012 in Syria . &quot;
&quot; his name was painted from the directory of the A@@ dra pris@@ ons , in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that p@@ ushing him to his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us will start thinking about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what did we give up in this process of temp@@ oral belie@@ fs ?
the web developer for open source and digital activist is the Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi reported that the &quot; Military Police Bas@@ sel had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der @-@ Assad government and put it into knowledge of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his stay and condition remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in which access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project which founded Bas@@ sel , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps there was no one of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes prior to the work , which started around 2005 with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous civi@@ liz@@ ations , and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put everything on it , this architecture not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this review in the digital archae@@ ology and the conservation has created a time capit@@ ol that will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able value .
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not finish this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was already in custody . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read English good , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he always has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners , as they use computers , at least in theory , without having actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she gave the lyrics to him , when she visited him , and translated it from Arab into English . &quot;
the book is licensed freely .
book covers from Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens with every visit , &quot;
&quot; I sing in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; at the moment I lose comfort in the moment , in which we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation of the prison
and I dr@@ inge in every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; I bear with passion , my passion , &quot;
if yours eyes say farewell
and I &apos;ll let another piece of my soul ...
&quot; quickly , I return to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to get all the moments , &quot;
and to weep and to weep over your absence .
&quot; I bear record myself , that I will return soon ... &quot;
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bas@@ sel , G@@ ha@@ zi wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year passes , my soul &quot;
while
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of the monster
Bass@@ els story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests against the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad , the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared more than 6@@ 5.000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or arrested by violence through the regime , tortured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in prison since 2011 . &quot;
many other people are unknown .
the global Vo@@ ices Community calls for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
today we repeat our demand in hope we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption condem@@ ns director after dis@@ miss@@ al release again
&quot; the Mozambique re@@ acted to a corruption scandal during which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the State apparatus , which was celebrated in corruption . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other def@@ endants with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public agencies of the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza was appointed between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately requested his re@@ setting into the company which happened on April 19 then .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic that issued the application , there was no obst@@ acle cause for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to post his old post , because the company was not executed in detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants are not hot . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re@@ prove the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ back with regard to the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; what we have the knowledge is , that the company should have been carried out a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ process against the contradi@@ ctions . &quot;
&quot; however , the firm silent however , however , imp@@ lies no appropriate legal action for the application of the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contradi@@ cted &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent type , it would be advis@@ able after having been sentenced to a sentence and of which half had eaten . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image . &quot;
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to be integrated into the firm , which he helped to add damage . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
contradi@@ cted !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political sciences in Brazil says , the director does not have any mor@@ ality : &quot;
Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he did not believe him that they have rewarded him so massi@@ vely by the state .
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als and serve the state , * he already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead saved himself to the state instead . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was used to state the state , as a hand@@ ele to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself became tired of this man to be charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers there to remember the prime minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to the prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el in prison , not only for ever , as the first independent President in memory , but also as a sharp , lon@@ es@@ ome and - inci@@ dentally - prophe@@ tic redund@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations was , when he confirmed energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of anything , also to sell the fath@@ er@@ land for its amb@@ itions , its own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not the case . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not turn from his amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time crimin@@ als .
in Twitter the reactions were also le@@ aning :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , and he was sitting for 10 years . &quot;
&quot; and today he sets the company in which he res@@ ent@@ ed money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Par@@ tic@@ α@@ Diff@@ ic@@ ure@@ v ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chick@@ peas and age @-@ age .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received their posts from the net because they ab@@ stain@@ ed the word &apos; Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is normally used to refer to people East Indian origin or are generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook has addressed the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; , &quot; in bur@@ ial writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the ascent has been radic@@ ally nation@@ alist movements to the word an extremely wor@@ sen@@ ed con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that usually used by Ultra Nation@@ alists than hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to tackle hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; usually may be associated with rac@@ ism today , but the word itself doesn &apos;t call itself automatically hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people reported that even Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the Word or expressed doubts about his use , were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post @-@ one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether they could sore , as he could relie@@ ve his back pain , by p@@ ushing a vocabulary . &quot;
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ able ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ s is the opinion that they will decrease hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook needs to be analy@@ tic , before it extingu@@ ishes all the posts that dis@@ semin@@ ate rac@@ ism in sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the Word automatically .
&quot; the Autom@@ ism will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook . &quot;
&quot; what to do instead , is to analyse the mail carefully and check it by checking the next words . &quot;
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spher@@ es ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three nation@@ alists who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate language , will receive a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the promotion has a strong signal to all , the hate language may dis@@ semin@@ ate the efficiency of this strategy . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the c@@ ens@@ orship of brass often have a cat and mouse game , with the user to use social networks , a new word or an alternative notation of cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook started to er@@ ase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned by the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and parts of contents for 24 hours , because the Post @-@ Facebook Community does not dis@@ agree . &quot;
Facebook has a variety of poets of people that have no negative int@@ entions or simply attempt to show their opinions against hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed , who has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post the author shared his opinion about , why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more would have had more , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a good intention to reduce rac@@ ism to Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
&quot; for such words , there will only be more hatred within the different communities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and as &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; peas cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they did not have mistakes , they tried not to correct the f@@ eit@@ ful Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they have only something more respect for the 15 million benefits , which had a large turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has ensured for a lot of don@@ ors among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now aware of Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , to see if their posts will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook po@@ sts that no hate speech ab@@ stain@@ ed , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the peas and see an Indian movie .
&quot; to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screenshot , with permission . &quot;
&quot; post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screenshot , with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ideology and religious foundations , social networks have used to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech will also heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where there were disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts thousands of escape . &quot;
Facebook has been de@@ ferred to his bur@@ ial sites of his bur@@ ial sites across his bur@@ ial sites .
&quot; but instead of using the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better running in context than on code concentration initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago has no end with the children
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the State Parliament adopted unanimously a law unanimously decided that this practice is to be able to marry , so that the successful age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the sp@@ ouses there were several members of du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities at the practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , a group , the representative of the various religious groups in the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state did not im@@ itate maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened un@@ att@@ ested to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago has defined a contract partner of the UN child Convention on the min@@ ors , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; the United Nations statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who had already been married to 15 , were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2.8 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the State Department of the State confirmed that from 1997 to 2007 , more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ ition@@ ing and social media movements that stri@@ ves to abol@@ ish laws , followed by the foot , followed in great support . without doubt she helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leaders , for example , had no concern to tell the criticism of the child before they should say , dam@@ n even to her own matters . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition targeted for ten@@ sions in this actually intri@@ cate one , and sometime caught doubts whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would be able to make it a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle to Inst@@ ag@@ ram :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill to the child before was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
&quot; after having decided in the Senate , the draft law can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed because the laws were finally changed to the child before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a Minister of Ministers in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary d@@ ossi@@ p that has lost the core of the thing , but know what ? the child before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally arrived : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook of L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which says : , &quot;
the sp@@ ouse has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for sure ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who heard the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society that was quite openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the married at Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the change of sp@@ ouses has been decided today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 representatives , 35 of them were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all the members , who were contrary to the law , voted for the law . &quot;
the child before is legally not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # In@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ ism .
many thanks to all the activists who have put him out .
congratulations . congratulations .
thank you to our M@@ EPs .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ Organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to do judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and it seems to redeem his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the General Prosecutor of Paris Al @-@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law , it was quite true if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed to the law , the most social media users wanted to deal with the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking to the discussion so generally speaking , in a way that we may talk to the state that they might speak instead of the problem that they may be mis@@ used to them that they may be mis@@ used to them , &quot; would you be willing to continue their discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there is still places in the world where the child &apos;s in different gra@@ d@@ ations are legal or still the norm , even though there is laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; due to the sk@@ e@@ wers of websites , Turkish users can view Wikipedia contents again &quot;

&quot; for more than one month , Turkey has left the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day becomes clear@@ er , as important the platform for users to find helpful as well as reliable information . &quot;
both students and fans of TV series defend themselves against the lock .
&quot; although many techn@@ ician internet users are used to use changing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times , that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ency in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been edited by Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University has been held regularly since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that mirror content of Wikipedia and frequently are being updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform made all Turkish Wikipedia @-@ pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so calcul@@ ator @-@ computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is un@@ acceptable in spite of the prohibition . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put all of it to stop snap@@ shots of Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content on de@@ centr@@ alised and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot achieve the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ .org website . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also gave that this step was carried out independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia took part in other efforts to handle sperm . &quot;
&quot; Cri@@ sti@@ an Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has collected both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ op@@ .org , an open source project by Wikipedia , as also Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use similar to Mir@@ ror@@ sides by Wikipedia when in particular country Wikipedia is blocked . &quot;
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; there is no complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , an Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; you can interv@@ ene to another URL , which is not the original . that what you see then is by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially the server leads the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

he described Facebook as this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park in a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer !
&quot; I rested my home just at home , when Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the D@@ am river is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was found and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar dispute a collaboration with the authorities to obtain world recognition for Nepal as nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood up tig@@ ers from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can &apos;t b@@ other@@ ed himself from the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the name of their husbands , or even of older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use an pron@@ o@@ uns or to say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect her husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences , they should use the norm to keep this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced from the Indian state of O@@ was@@ a by a placebo and the village community , after she had addressed a married relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of her wives also did not call on behalf , is also common among men . however , they have far less jurisdiction to worry if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the little village of Wal@@ he in Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women gathered , among them health staff and house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss the delic@@ acy of the patri@@ arch@@ ate and discuss . &quot;
&quot; when one of 56 clubs , which are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and is used for the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices , such as children &apos;s hei@@ r@@ ition@@ ing up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this clubs . &quot;
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they have made it at the same time at the same time .
&quot; the first video , which showed the Roh@@ ini in her discussion , acted by women who call her husbands at the name . &quot;
&quot; she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , with which women can easily identify themselves . &quot;
&quot; to express the name of their husbands , a Br@@ also , which she pleaded not guilty to all , and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
&quot; this tradition testified that a woman will respect her husband , and wish him a long life . &quot;
&quot; a woman , who doesn &apos;t keep it , is regarded as a mis@@ fortune , as a woman without mor@@ ality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted that we &apos;ve never had thought of this discussion on this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted to have her husband as well as the name of her husband , to try out at home , as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini is telling :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law mother and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was ended .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned aside to me and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started her first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot; some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women attempted to raise the discussion with a practice in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us , means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was of the village of Wal@@ let in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition in which women should never speak of their husbands &quot; name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini is telling :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she had caught up during the whole practice , and another decided to allow him to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by exp@@ iring him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in the A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ward , with an old bridge , the women decided that they would actually try to call her husbands at home . &quot;
and they stopped their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a multitude of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini to and asked what ideas they put on women in the head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another pru@@ dent member decided to do it during dinner from the whole family .
&quot; as her mother @-@ in @-@ law she touched me , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the wearing of the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red Pun@@ ch on the forehead , pointing to the marriage status : &quot;
why must only women show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he would do it too . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him , to bear him . &quot;
&quot; the other women have not ended up completely , but mean that they are now in a better position to vote himself in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , discussion sc@@ rum is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we &apos;re doing a trip at each discussion .
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to worry about women , who might hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they dance and sang , talking about things about which they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; for so many years I have been working on these problems and yet , too , have some things , for example , such as our ident@@ ities on our husbands , never said so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say , certain things can say , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have been talking about the concept of honor and connected with clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have applied only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; most is the okay , but some wanted an Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta to bear a wide shirt above a tro@@ users ; they don &apos;t dar@@ ed themselves . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own war@@ nings , mor@@ als are connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , s@@ wollen Roh@@ ini her own couple Kur@@ t@@ as ( upper block ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can bear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it . &quot;
&quot; referring to the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion of discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have made only small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then we stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , make it still , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their husbands ; one or two women are now taking Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red at their fore@@ heads .
the women in discussion sc@@ ap@@ se know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - how to reach more freedom of movement or their own h@@ anger - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ able river .
&quot; giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am too .
&quot; but this club , each of us , gives us the confidence that something will change . &quot;
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman go home in the club and what else we are talking about what we are doing and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for organic trade unions , probably for super@@ faithful purposes , is thought to be a number of operations in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken from .
&quot; two men were arrested and in the result they stood , that the bodies of sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; there is the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a believing man &apos;s gold might cause gold , declared the pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that the successive attacks were registered on a record of men in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of murdered victims for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in South African country led a mission to examine these practices .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries in southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .

&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the murdered victims were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Ad@@ amo , student , and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police already postpon@@ ed the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the lab@@ ans are involved in the death of a record @-@ member men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of believing people for the extraction and sale of its organs in Mor@@ ov@@ em@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , has given cultural moti@@ ves and is given by the traditional fi@@ bre@@ ads , which also exist that a belief of the Republic might exist , according to which the victims of their head might exist , according to the victims of their minds . &quot;
in the last days three men have been murdered with hair problems in this part of the country .
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed the chron@@ icle of the poor Smith S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa indicating that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Mozambique is oppos@@ ing : &quot;
&quot; I want GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT I &apos;m ashamed A country where people would like to go on the road to make sex against good notes , work and other achievements to earn their bread , a country in which the elderly people would still continue to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or &quot; black magic &quot; will aim to aim to get a quick wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomena , some may not miss the opportunity for ma@@ kab@@ ren humor . &quot;

free Bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ti@@ ces Under Seri@@ ous Terror@@ ism of December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of international community for medical treatment of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate and Dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
&quot; a photograph of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a Global Vo@@ ices Framework Agreement .
the case of the incar@@ cer@@ ated Chinese dis@@ sidents of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in international community attention when his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage of the hospital .
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Department of Foreign Affairs in China has declared Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; and a speaker says it is not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China still receives views of the international community , the Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet , Liu X@@ ia , to allow him to permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries crit@@ ici@@ zed the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely eradi@@ cated . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate the treatment of Liu in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu , although the Norwegian government has said nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to go back to China , because exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; when the news was widespread , Liu was seriously ill seriously , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release , and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was unable to oppos@@ e its prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament passed a decision in which China was asked to free to release Liu and his wife to free from the house arrest and to allow him to seek medical support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called Li@@ us at the release of Li@@ us as she said in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet all visits , and they can be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador to Terry Bran@@ stad , told that the Americans , that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad , in@@ sof@@ ar it to him . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the Embassy must release the Chinese authorities not just Liu , but also his wife Liu X@@ ia free of house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request by the US Embassy drew a fur@@ ious answer from China to themselves , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country have the right to participate in and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel agent and access to the medical care of his choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz joined the Congress as well as a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push out Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; on 3 July , Berlin , Germany , Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu &apos;s support all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese president X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg , Germany . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters , China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on June 28 , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um urged China to provide an appropriate medical care to provide him and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told us that Li@@ us wife , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital , and that Liu is not allowed to contact anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says on :
&quot; Canada calls on China to protect its international human rights violations , including freedom of expression , and for exercising this rights reserved . &quot;
France
&quot; the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release on June 29 , Liu for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he needs , regardless where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact to him . &quot;
&quot; even though the news of news reports informed that the French government would welcome Liu in the land , the Foreign Ministry announced that there will be no further information if France will ultimately record it . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of State Affairs in Taiwan urged China on 27 June to show Liu fre@@ ed@@ oms and demand a bigger tolerance towards those who want peaceful resources to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u by the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress party also called for the sick of the sick of Liu , to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very much in a statement on 28 June , and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us being well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives that he took and had been strictly punished to a more harmon@@ ious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which again had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; personally I felt very moved and encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Justice Minister K. Sh@@ an@@ cour@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this observation has caused a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a town .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit an error .
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog of Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to defend the logic , to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land , you can say that we were not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities , a compulsory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of whose appearance he appeared ir@@ ref@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently being led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as you reach the key point of the subject , the good old surro@@ unds of the author@@ itarian sei@@ z@@ ab@@ ers , emerged , abandoned logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final effect , during the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , answers to his American guests concerning our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions he offered with non @-@ responses r@@ ational type .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , his opinion , because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog posted his comment , he shows that it should start with the critic@@ isms of the conference , that you could better understand the context of the statements by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the address .
&quot; as he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ favourable , even if we are looking forward to free and appropriate elections . &quot;
he missed Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said that Singapore , &quot; &quot; No country , &quot; he did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an displays his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam as leader of a her@@ ent @-@ growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am talking about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said it very much ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old yar@@ n , what expected me - be I agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed a mistake or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ dle speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country are the sovereign rights of the city Singapore back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role in the government , these are the statements of Mr Sh@@ an@@ arch@@ gam of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do they tell their military service , they defend their city , but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade to affir@@ mation , Singapore is always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many of the people of Singapur ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island State .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; , &quot; but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should talk of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect at your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world , and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series is from Nev@@ is Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question that is asked in Japan , is : &quot; are you an American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , and answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 , I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which the conversation is held , it is regarded as pol@@ ite , interest in his interview partners , making personal questions . &quot;
&quot; the standard answer is usually follows : &quot; Oh , rocky mountains , ice @-@ hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may be held in@@ war@@ dly especially when they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t distur@@ b me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that diff@@ ers us Can@@ adi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack , if they are travelling . &quot;
all love can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans by contrast ... .
&quot; so it was already , when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadian women have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay mar@@ riages are legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we clearly say very often , &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered the most toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like those types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
firstly I have many American friends which I ad@@ mi@@ red very much .
it would like nothing to be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : as &quot; nice &quot; to be referred to , is basically to be sk@@ e@@ tical - as good , gentle , gentle , but trag@@ ically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has one of his own Canadian doubles ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders , that is indeed a step forward . but the real problem exists in that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can encounter . &quot;
harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to earn any attention .
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that pass around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , say that the wish is free and alone , a principal independent of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own matters .
what out@@ standing as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadian women don &apos;t talk about the fence with the neighbours .
&quot; we are missing the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open friendliness , I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has just been sexy with Canada .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video published in Thailand was a music video published in Thailand , which took power over the jun@@ ta in 2014 , and in spite of their promises to restore the civilian government in 2014 . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells him how to make his friend his girlfriend .
&quot; although not explicitly politically , the music video rel@@ ates to the continued military power of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the band has been praised by many fans and other Internet users , to describe the situation of the country . &quot;
the video to song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook to 1.@@ 254 times and received 8.@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists trained to open the public . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the video , which relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have been har@@ assed in the last three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ kon@@ ic section 44 of the preliminary Constitution , given the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision on major national topics . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of the &quot; &quot; setting of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons who are considered as a critic of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , the online content monitors and persons accused of having s@@ lander the monarchy and have prosec@@ uted the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict mind against &quot; reading Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the Military Law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later there was a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continue to continue their decision is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , even though security experts said that the purchase is un@@ necessarily and a waste of tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it will even be shown how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans before introducing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they allegedly created &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet us@@ eless will cause long prison sentences you should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the band members of the band , who cited the Sal@@ ut of Pan@@ em , showed the tribute of Pan@@ em , who had already been used by p@@ utsch during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in Eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asian @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ off @-@ Finnish war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Thailand , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called viol@@ ins in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were more than 10,000 people here , today there are only a few hundred people in these cov@@ eted cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people after barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; this is a result of war , &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , which are called Chr@@ u@@ ush@@ cut@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
&quot; he starts a conversation , and it falls hard to end this . &quot;
&quot; this is a consequence of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why do I talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , which served all the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with infl@@ atable spl@@ end@@ our buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and had their contribution to the central planning industry of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
about fifty inhabitants live in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v kas , which can accommodate one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies where it is dry . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they re@@ discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has banned us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply is forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her friend something and suddenly they leave the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence sector ( cultivation of agricultural products for the property needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the laps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread in winter .

Gal@@ ina wants to assume no financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly install@@ ments are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden even a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells her that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; calling T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; &quot; they said , we could build cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;

every day she rec@@ alls the village spot in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ ti@@ en and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke out ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we have no fear of the dark street , or the few people . &quot;
one can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
&quot; every day I remember , as the city and the war were once . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation comes to the end , a little boy is passing by us . &quot;
it runs through the windows of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him back .
&quot; he plays with the ball , which then rolls the hill . &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our Partners PR@@ I.@@ org and appears with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; in the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Bra@@ ach@@ ula he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican , a small woman with a coral pink Br@@ illen@@ i@@ vory frame and gold @-@ coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many among the name M@@ om Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on the transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 Dollar the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bled walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no signs to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
&quot; at present , it &apos;s rather quiet , but in this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms that some have slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anybody .
&quot; they also helps them , and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can &apos;t pay , they massive them with a bal@@ m that used them from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived from a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa would be a reasonable first name for Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ ee ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ ón Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the family came from Angola to Brazil , hoping to go to Boston . &quot;
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her , because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very lov@@ ingly good .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans , which are on the way to the United States to make a normal stop in South America and then go towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other way accompanied by Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the route , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans are often going to travel together , and that the Afri@@ cans speak on What@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; like many of his approach , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world@@ cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy weak@@ ens , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest in M@@ um Africa for months : it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s future in the future .
&quot; m@@ um Africa is our mother and we never let it go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests will often send text messages when they went , to gr@@ ate them or to report her about the course of their trip . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the impulse of her work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chickens as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez may be very well known here , but it is not the only lack of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a s@@ asse leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valencia . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ ela and his family received migrants in their little house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and found that the Bu@@ stu@@ ets are sold to many African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking site outside . &quot;
Valen@@ cian states that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was referred to the United States after a raid on his work . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
&quot; José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to cap@@ e him , without having a plan . &quot;
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation , and a unknown , one all@@ ot@@ ting , has offered her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives , and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the traveler consult their teleph@@ ones . &quot;

China : X@@ in@@ jiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , micro @-@ scale . &quot;
&quot; X@@ in@@ jiang residents , a ethnic minorities region in the West of China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the mobile phone users in the Tian@@ shan district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone alert when it shows the District government , to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app will say that the app is to get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities did not use the app for more than com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because she , shortly after they had installed the app , news with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the police , the app would determine that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users to be aware how much time they spend online and to remote control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can naturally be used in various ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state or even h@@ acker able to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements via digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme tough@@ er and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ iss@@ ing Internet . &quot;
&quot; the media @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( one of the studios has published on Twitter , showed photos from a check@@ point , in which polic@@ emen were able to re@@ prove that they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang @-@ App .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a Check@@ point using a device without these software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
that is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; people are forced to use devices that are thought for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( a number of persons ) , also published a j@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which indicates that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receives un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ in@@ jiang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the town council , to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and with the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office in operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also referred to these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang , authorities published on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs , to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable HD@@ Ds , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible prevention , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and imagine that you are all alone at a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved after and after dis@@ b@@ anded and a truth , which is clearly recognis@@ able , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name honor .
&quot; one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions , which allow no met@@ aph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; but when you come back to reality and look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings from meat and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve themselves in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is caught on the axis of the storm , that you are caught between the walls that your parents are built here , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone was built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough to form@@ ulate &quot; my lesson , &quot; as the boss of the Security Services would form@@ ulate it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he insi@@ sted his power over us in that he even destroyed the easiest concepts that we knew .
five young people were torn apart during a peaceful strike as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to cut the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er . &quot;
&quot; all the quarters were cov@@ eted , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , un@@ condition@@ ally , in the wrong time , even if I had no high demands to a city that was up to the arter@@ ies with state safety organisms and their complic@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming down after the power supply of the neighborhood had heard . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence , when I cried several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I listened to my voice through silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to cooperate . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we lied to a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations and fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it simply don &apos;t care in the smell . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you swal@@ low - nothing can return to your voice , after giving you all the way to the office of the security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I was now .
&quot; Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to talk : &quot; let me hear , as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re just brave enough when we are not nearby . &quot;
his eyes met up on me .
&quot; and you will look at what to look for me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did then did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure when I answered : &quot; I would not have thought that you have already forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look to you in my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such disast@@ rous consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; he is in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement , and his father equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it , too . &quot;
the sc@@ ank of this twi@@ sting set is mine till today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ atic torture which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I pier@@ ced the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself . &quot;
&quot; afterwards again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a gear to individual cells . &quot;
I &apos;m looking forward to all details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise they would have assigned a larger cell in this time .
&quot; I have to share them with only one single prisoners and may immediately set me immediately , without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I laid hold back on an old and tried communication method : with the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell palace was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ it@@ ry , he responded to me . &quot;
apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a prestigious man @-@ aged aged who resem@@ bles me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there can be no distinctive facial features , and there are no doctors here ; we are all the numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers are inter@@ connected .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; investig@@ ators had assured me , they would fre@@ ak@@ y him when I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a bird @-@ shy , to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time , the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of the destro@@ yer is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; note on 13 S@@ ure of Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; this was the mystery to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wit@@ tic dial@@ ect - so they played their conf@@ essi@@ onal issu@@ ing ticket and ri@@ pped the close eye view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call Ko@@ exist@@ ence to turn the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the hearing and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man . at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , the expression of him : &quot; &quot; my young , you are still young , you can join this T@@ age@@ di@@ eben and to protest at demonstrations , which will soon become an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
&quot; I am acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to answer me , not to answer . &quot;
&quot; I can really say no more exactly when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes , after a friendly conversation for me , become an ordinary communication tool . &quot;
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me told me that I had to get used to be punished , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to tear , as much as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession &quot; .
&quot; it starts with a plastic pipe , which probably dates from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your hen gath@@ ers in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure you with it , and you cannot hold your cry out . &quot;
&quot; my cry have not cast him yet enough , so that the tube could be replaced by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a gar@@ bage truck or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in each other , to present ourselves from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them rarely changed , while I was still in the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , which I heard . &quot;
&quot; the hen noted the cooling , and found no pleasure in it , which is why he served as next to a electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground was the perfect power plant . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
&quot; after two horri@@ ble hours , he decided that he had met his duty for this night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; a few hours passed , who came to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fills the room . &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I answer the voice of an exhau@@ stible young people : &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you are shi@@ fted . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always released .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smoking a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b brings much of his time inside ; once again he turns into his screen , time to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what can be abandoned , a cigarette between his fingers , or his nic@@ ot@@ ine lips can be discovered . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank , which she had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( approximately : farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is a passionate activist , which is the conservative majority opposite to gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also demands the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics do not only find in its hom@@ etown Amman re@@ ev@@ ance but also in cities that suff@@ ice from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking , and he can feel noisy with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he doesn &apos;t open it openly , he gets a special consideration against the U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b viewed his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian skir@@ t of second generation , &quot; even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own life states , &quot; emphas@@ izes H@@ d@@ ai@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a man , while he dissolved in water , Nes@@ ad@@ an . it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food during the Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the pieces of tep@@ id coffee and the scales of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose is first of freedom .
&quot; in the meantime , Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially when looking at a glance into neighbouring countries . &quot;
hence it avo@@ ids easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison .
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan had cancelled a performance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila to the second time . &quot;
some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual Fron@@ ti@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no to oppos@@ e the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country .
&quot; in an interview with CNN , the Euro MP Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; many also claim , the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila embra@@ ced the Jord@@ anian people as a progressive supporters of human rights , who continue to continue to use an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to be rhet@@ oric , but it is actually a clear @-@ cryst@@ alline reality in Jordan , which is clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs plant . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b &apos;s traditional Gender nor@@ ms came back to body by decl@@ aring his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a obviously crushed woman , whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust .
&quot; over the past few years , the number of honour of honour has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch , according to Human Rights Watch , reached its peak in 2016 ; however , the number of honour is missing in the year 2016 ; however , Jordan became the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the un@@ break@@ able control of the year 1954 , women who are exposed to the risk of familiar violence as well , and for their release is often a year @-@ long bureaucr@@ atic service as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it , too , not to rep@@ udi@@ ate topics that are long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ying that his work is politically , however , he grants that his music , which is full of explic@@ it claims to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , cannot be able to separate politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , husband . &quot;
&quot; he was dre@@ aming of politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos; ed &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question about the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically on the core , can continue . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b published a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; the further course of the song , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can , in his words , &quot; that can be , &quot; whether faith or non @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noticed that hardly anyone says in Jordan on the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans , and that comments on equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals still were cen@@ sored in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , later to notice that his comments were torn from the context , revol@@ ted and cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts , but it was only a re@@ worked version , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b ac@@ qui@@ res the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als is not dis@@ miss@@ able to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ a , a poet from the eighth century , who still remained in memory thanks to his hom@@ o@@ otic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what , who should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , was openly able to write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do not believe it ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Irish Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government is rehabil@@ itated on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices be brought to silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service adopted several former government administr@@ ations and members of the teacher &apos;s teaching committee , with the reasons , they had agreed on comments in social media , which im@@ pose corruption in the country with the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of what is the show of H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs , only the tip of the ice@@ berg , according to the actual challenge , is a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a permanent stra@@ pping and take place . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila now for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is made of slow , bed@@ itor and inner changes . it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society take place . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dre@@ aming not only to bring his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will domin@@ ate the region by music , art and literature of a true and fundamental op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , spreading un@@ itions and an artificial way to run demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until the time is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to grow and consequently resist resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was enabled by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which is heard as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; this large , extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ riors are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous the@@ ories in regard to the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festivals .
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many oppos@@ ing To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory is that the truck , dr@@ um@@ mers and dancing over more than a thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , to force on the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could s@@ nap some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking for the meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en in a long time : two solid cars are just seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true and yet a breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre high @-@ car was incredible .

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care so important as in this history , because they help to maintain the Peru@@ vian youth from crime and to promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug dealers are everyday . &quot;
&quot; published in April 2017 , the survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population would not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - rising demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance , and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led that more norm@@ ality into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers can form them . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there are experts against each other to show , who can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric lungs as one can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; education facilities such as the school Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , found in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to share their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dressing sciss@@ or , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities of opportunities , dozens of teenagers have seen that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; the school offered special training workshops prior to the school year in March , reporting some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for children , we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

&quot; the following article is the processed version of the &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ sch@@ ists &quot; &quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; published the International Online Magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this post is published in a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who can out@@ fit themselves , to bring in aff@@ ection ? &quot;
this question was exactly the question of the young Colom@@ bian activist Leonardo P@@ á@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the foundation Bog@@ ot@@ he and Cri@@ sti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) which encour@@ ages young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; only recently , her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had closed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Armed Forces ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the sig@@ nat@@ ory of the peace agreement was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
&quot; however , in front of Colombia , there is still a long way until you speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a military rhet@@ oric , and around the clock they had to integrate their weapons to the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which itself acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to life in constant fear and in some cases , had acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed for gu@@ err@@ illas in some cases , and support them in its ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the Young Colombia would have to be joined together and the integration process would have to help .
and exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love botanical extracts of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them again in the company .
the campaign of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters - which should then be handed over to personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the Camp@@ aign
&quot; the idea for the reconciliation of Recon@@ ciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bog@@ ot@@ á in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an had the opportunity to speak short with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love human beings , who we love to write on Valentine &apos;s Day , but those who need to need a lot more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he continued to share his love with people in this year and needed the most urgent additives . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to build a new life . &quot; &quot; letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a history of peace &quot; , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ á . &quot;
I would never thought that someone would be forgiven
&quot; the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , on 19th March . &quot;
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ way to persu@@ ade the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC introduced themselves as they had done before to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters full of sub@@ missions from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , and told the political scientist Jim@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ nez Av@@ ila . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Governor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after having passed the letters , a former fighter led me through the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ates , a fatal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter which someone has written to me . &quot;
it &apos; a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life has written me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I h@@ ug@@ ged him , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions to be this dam@@ pers , and would help him to write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had something different from life than war . himself was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I would never thought that someone would forgive for my mistakes .
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside , the open arms waiting for us . &quot;
until now I have learned only how I must deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace is re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the start , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion round . &quot;
&quot; the students were all raised as early as the war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore the leader of the F@@ ARC was the story of the organization , their ideas and gave insight into their views over the peace process : &quot; for many years , we witnessed how the social in@@ justice on the entire Colom@@ bian people can help us to create a political party , we can help to create the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a target of this size , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; listening to this people who had never heard any hearing yet , and to recognize that people , which I often saw as a monster , and even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned out through their life circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much damage to bring us something , and give us a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered on the letters .
&quot; for example , in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , Gust@@ avo de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of Cal@@ i , wrote the following letter : &quot;
&quot; in Colombia , Colombia has made sure that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation peace would rule peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise , and to protest their rights , and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call for all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they hear - to rise across all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , because we know from my own experience that nothing is simple . among us that defend life as foundation of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homos@@ exual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region , are subject to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and ext@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; with terr@@ ors , activists have experienced the coverage of the past months about persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which hang@@ s like a mono@@ cl@@ onal value of the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only possible overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us what currently happens in the Republic . &quot;
LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has conquered international headlines in several months after reports that the to@@ wing , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic of them@@ at@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ ects men susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a tran@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
she felt her childhood since her childhood . she was a woman in reality .
&quot; when they were grown up , you became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safer place for them , why they went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt was opened to Sabrina . &quot;
they came out of fear for her life last night in the US .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer Hel@@ fer@@ an in a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that somebody needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a tran@@ woman that was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; as I tried to help her , someone made from whom I thought , he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he gave them no more men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya that can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
afterwards the photos of my documents took the round through What@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was doing just a few grocery bags from the back of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned myself , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt me . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family , you shame ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke up the last end of the hospital .
apparently some women had all involved and started to scre@@ am .
the man was fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two j@@ ell@@ ations in my right lung tower . &quot;
OC Media : in which ambul@@ ance were you laid down - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are dated , there is still my male name , but the doctor rose up and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I appreciate him to be respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely un@@ known . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some remote relatives .
&quot; the desired , send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they set absur@@ de demands : some told me that I had to prove it without through the streets ; others wanted me to change my gender in the official TV , and I say that everything was only bad , photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still difficult for them .
some elderly people said once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you , because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a rope around his neck . &quot;
luck@@ ily the neighbours came and saved them .
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it was clear that something was la@@ zy . &quot;
my human right @-@ right friends crossed the number@@ ing plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you see ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I want to remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something unexpected happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could .
&quot; shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought her , without writing me , without notice , without everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the gar@@ bage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a fore@@ igner .
I put the SIM card to my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , only because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you plug . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is # 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : just with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality . however , this is a t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
&quot; a few traditional Caucas@@ ian elements , I still bear in me . &quot;
&quot; so very much I wish it , this se@@ atic barrier I can not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really give me effort to consider how the person reminds us of her past , that is why my male form . &quot;
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for whom I needed more information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has spent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an there were no people arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock up a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; that I may download them , they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; by blood is experienced . &quot;
OC Media : are now gay men held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
&quot; Sabrina : a friend of me says , there were just not many . &quot;
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no relatives or they were dropped by their relatives to settle Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there so that you can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not just disappeared , but targeted to radic@@ alize himself . &quot;
OC Media : is it just a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just have been imprisoned for one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people have disappeared in this prison , after having grown be@@ ard . &quot;
there was nothing new from them since .
they simply took them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even involved when these men were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as a band@@ its , there were no reports yet . but we would susp@@ ect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else would it not have been allowed to shave this man ?
&quot; do you know if these persecutions and designs of people , who heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already in 2003 , I was already well known , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally intended to lead us to the &quot; ci@@ vil@@ isation , &quot; but ultimately kicked us back into the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were sli@@ pped , I had painted eyelashes , wore Rö@@ hren@@ je@@ ans and a short tops . &quot;
the Sh@@ aria &apos;s security department has never been curved to me .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where there were several ben@@ ches , and all the city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ emer : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; Sp@@ otte does not know about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; they often say often to children , when they have fun over sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply locked her eyes before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; never off@@ ended me , never stran@@ ded and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long kept this gifts time ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row joined the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but rather than the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could sense how people began in the city to change . &quot;
&quot; he who had gel@@ ed and laugh@@ ed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in the time , I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily s@@ lim@@ mer . &quot;
OC Media : what activity will you go after ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activist . &quot;
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I uni@@ fy them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ ries , compositions , I gi@@ ite her to the hospital , and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t miss a cent for this .
I discovered this people as a flu@@ ent variety .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : this is al@@ bern .
&quot; that is , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s exactly the same as ch@@ ase , who want to do with foam before your mouth , that there is no tail with them . &quot;
the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er who have Russians also ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; I come from there , so it &apos;s un@@ pleasant to hear something . &quot;
I meet here so many men out of the Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practic@@ ed Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
&quot; do you know , many think about Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a gu@@ ardian angel . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin , and not ashamed to my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups war@@ n an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase of suicide . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is min@@ ted by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Province of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that could rise in@@ ability to his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who like to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube video the moments , after he had kind@@ led himself , was fixed . &quot;
some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames back and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was put into the Tal@@ eg@@ nes hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; according to local sources , they were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only committed suicide that happened in August in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists war@@ n against any more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ ved Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung up . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a matter together : it were all family @-@ fathers , who felt due to the persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families and to pursue safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , which is based in a vast majority of Iran @-@ based Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to deny their living . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 great efforts to end the ethnic autonomy under Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the biggest in Iran pre @-@ coming oil and gas fields , and some of the most influential and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy is still developing only slowly , and the indigenous population receives only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; often , it is often victim of untreated diseases , hunger and relaxing . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime ref@@ uses to systematic jobs in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a wide range of dem@@ on , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian regions , where Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma lie there . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian youth has now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who seek a job , finished primary school , finished by 55 % a secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse than worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic minorities , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the integration process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions pre@@ fers no Arab labour , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to working possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed to anni@@ hil@@ ate the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to earn their living outside of their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their fore@@ - and sur@@ name , to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , because even Arabic name will not be toler@@ ated , because the Arabic name of Arab language , or the Arabic language is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i must stand , human rights activists strike the alarm before the situation is explosive . &quot;
&quot; it remains to wait , whether the world awak@@ ens and knowledge . &quot;
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ ic@@ able is avo@@ id@@ able .

&quot; why not I identified myself with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photos . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was an object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
&quot; they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside . &quot;
&quot; for example , in spite of equal education , women still earn less money than men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , if it &apos;s about doing what they are doing with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social nor@@ ms still ensure that women are sooner or later in various sectors of life to a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on the many different countries and cre@@ ators . &quot;
all this is aware and known .
I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; nevertheless : if I come to talk to skin color , on rac@@ ism , on black c@@ is women , to black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ @-@ community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I say , what kind of femin@@ ist and verb@@ al women , many white Femin@@ ist and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists have been silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all women agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; &quot; their voices , &quot; &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it that in addition to sexual violence , there is an institutional form of motivated violence that there are black women to be exposed to two times . &quot;
or beyond that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and arrivals are less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant background are more frequently referred to as a white girl , because of obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black Sp@@ h@@ ar and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I want all women , all men and all men , neither skin colour that have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider the white woman who ref@@ uses to take into account for both the sex as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and won &apos;t fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spher@@ es , who always turned me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , in their speech , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is in historical ways , a deser@@ ted and mar@@ gin@@ alised beings . &quot;
&quot; I feed myself , to join me group@@ ings , who also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ ec@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to honor them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to be a home to women of different Her@@ ons and to mar@@ row from white Femin@@ ism , the word &quot; Femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully and to get rid of femin@@ ism and to use me the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so hard to be celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever before , that we will define black women in our own ideas and we are going to be created for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the Book of Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : as we can withdraw ourselves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we can withdraw ourselves , in which they can defend ourselves in this way , in which they can be rever@@ ed to our own way , in which they can be rever@@ ed to the spiritual , spiritual , physical , physical and even the spiritual elements . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , I ask you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradi@@ ctions of the femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because I exist in this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither exagger@@ ated , nor rejected . &quot;
&quot; p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission , to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations &quot;

&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; Maikel Nabil Mus@@ a returned to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan Regional region . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river which we had lost , I was still a child , &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a told . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war , construction of reservoir , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers , Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ b@@ art@@ ender Alliance - which promotes the rivers and streams in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ izes the drums and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and edited for En@@ sia von Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , in Iraq , a documentary filmmaker and a multimedia journalist . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; from Kur@@ tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # v@@ lich@@ en@@ vir@@ g@@ inity ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the acts , but they could not do more . &quot;
&quot; when another wife of Bal@@ bu@@ ena was found because of abuse , also the ak@@ ten@@ er display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez has nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman returned its ad . &quot;
&quot; to break the v@@ icious circle of violence against women , is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women don &apos;t want to refund it at all , they are generally not receiving support by the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women also depend on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victims of violence as well as the prosecution authorities . &quot;
intu@@ ition 1 stro@@ kes and Stati@@ stic 2 In@@ visible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that nothing under@@ mm@@ ed 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women really are mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various reports and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are al@@ ar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Office of At@@ tor@@ ney , 9@@ 600 ads went to domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came by women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence at peace offerings . 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women reported that they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
these statistics show not the true magn@@ itude of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , are 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; for every woman who will not be refunded because of physical abuse , two women , who do not do this , declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a separate criminal law , the prosecution authorities cannot be adequ@@ ately documented , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases , in which women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ sions and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , they didn &apos;t want to do that , but then , however , she was supposed to repent . &quot;
Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but for two years she brought the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most notable :
I never thought that I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women , because they are fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook , where they described his ins@@ ults and several attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated it . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like , as wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least one certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that her former partner is mi@@ stre@@ ated them . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women that are all in any way victim of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experience , listening to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; it finally managed to convince her wealthy partner to convince her , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he started to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads stayed in the authorities without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed to become an imper@@ me@@ able jur@@ ist struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it mainly went to money , power , and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay laws : good approach , defective implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws , which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of ab@@ uses is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill of bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ El@@ la ( # Für@@ st ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and motion # Ni@@ att@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law sees to explain fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and pun@@ ish har@@ ness as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; the bill was changed in some points , in order to gain the members of the law , that the way for the crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions that are currently forbidden in Paraguay , and to be punished with up to five years . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had to fore@@ see the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) procedure which must be present in the victims of violence , if they just want to refund and maintain a secure property to state the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective if the legisl@@ ature does not provide sufficient financial funds to provide :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part between human relationships . &quot;
here must be a re@@ think that violence is not considered a little longer .
&quot; in view of these facts , he is guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will come away . &quot;
we will refund such a long ad until abuse does not apply more than normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was passed in the par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been altered . among other things , a passage has been canc@@ eled , which the partners came to reconciliation in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the passage in reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor , to attack his victims . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;
this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and revised version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ en@@ vir@@ g@@ inity ) which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons .
&quot; an independent media in Oman , a year after the ban continues to attack attacks . &quot;
&quot; this website has been locked because of the decision of the Ministry of Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the Iranian authorities signed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its coverage of corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and turned into court later . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed by the Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said since 1970 , who came to power after he had set up his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of law . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only s@@ ult@@ an , the main office in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s reign is marked by the har@@ r@@ ative efforts of security forces , in particular the state secret service , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , non @-@ governmental journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , were in@@ timi@@ dated and detained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights , including activists , and their views on public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisoned three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was prohibited until the authorities were banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , who was published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , having appeared an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands on Justice . &quot; it went around corruption in the Ju@@ di@@ ci@@ ary , and the interference by high @-@ ranking officers in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court of Oman under pressure , to raise a judgment in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n from July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties &quot; hands on judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was charged by the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS drew the deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who was editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on an in@@ definite period , after the information minister had given the order that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 is prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber found the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted among others because of the distur@@ b@@ ance of the Internet &quot; and &quot; Under@@ water of the State &quot; . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violations of a public ban and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and pen@@ alties in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . he was also charged a year of employment against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after he could represent the use of an information gri@@ ds to spread material that could be found a danger for public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was fixed in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 December 2016 , the Appeals Court acquitted Al @-@ Abr@@ i on 26 December 2016 , and sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence in prison .
the Court of Appeal also emphas@@ ized the decision of the Ministry of Information on the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
&quot; in spite of the decision of the court , Az@@ am@@ n , the paper looks after the attacks of attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Ministry of Information received an instruction that extended the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister issued a further time against the decision of the Appeals Court , announced the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at the recent times , press freedom was injured . &quot;
&quot; further injuries include the closing of the website of the independent journal Mo@@ wat@@ in and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper in the country . &quot;
&quot; due to the lasting cl@@ amping of Az@@ am@@ n and the incar@@ cer@@ ation of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the government officials are still not willing to prepare an end for extensive injury of press freedom . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the National Auth@@ orities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . protect the freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights defence and journalists in Oman their righ@@ tful human rights work uncertain and without fear of violations , including judicial kill@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defence ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support and protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , image takes place with his agreement &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is only rarely mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need of medical research there are two reasons : for a lack of medical services , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines to cover the special medical needs on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa as elsewhere , and lack of investments in research by pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research that will be carried out by African scientists in establishing its own research capacities in Africa . a major role of science and technology can be used for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first engraved impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Sam@@ bia for studying in the United States , first in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus itself before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understanding of the media on these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ic national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just launch a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant diseases . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important current science topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only bet solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise , we will always stay the recipient , instead of being mo@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it &apos;s impossible to use them here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the United States and Europe .
the projects are well supported .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or go here , because funding and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles do you have in your routine research work that you did not have ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money , a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interested but a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would propose that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
&quot; there is need to special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine are prof@@ iting from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across western countries - based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , there are limited speed , things to do , and the risk of access to scientific expertise listed here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that perio@@ dic@@ ally make an article accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the United States to India : like &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally reported on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been a salad of the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as out@@ sourcing , the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was only given through its own income and the question how many sal@@ aries can get it . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them . &quot;
&quot; patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for certain characteristics as resistance to diseases , a special red or green leaves or cro@@ ached leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years more , more of such patents have been filed for more plants such as cereal or cart@@ on varieties . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security in order to ensure the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still has a salad , but he now needs longer because his work is always worth more constra@@ ints forever . &quot;
it &apos;s like I would lie in a river a b@@ oul@@ ume that I must get her@@ ring .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it is a split with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents will go on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new sal@@ aries , because all characteristics are already patented . so it &apos;s so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very c@@ auti@@ ous and tried to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has also joined a movement that is becoming increasingly larger in the United States and everywhere , Open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; Source ) . &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have been cultivated and ate red redness in the &quot; greenhouse . &quot; the station is cultivated and eaten . there will be tested if plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like this , as if the movement from the IT area should come from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; open source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seeds ) can be inspired by the motion for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders are usable permanently . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can commit to ensure that others can be used by them far@@ med crops . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to make stores and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breed it , to cruci@@ fy it , and not immediately utter@@ ed - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for emer@@ itus Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seed plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would attempt to breed latter with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; if you want to buy good , locally and sustainable food industry , it should also know that the species is far@@ med in the farm markets , should also know how this vegetables is far@@ med . &quot;
&quot; food sovereign , undoubtedly , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative is committed to under@@ take other seed further to their seed . in contrast , seeds and plant characteristics are patented . &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i Supp@@ orters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply may be at risk , as the self @-@ contained gen@@ pool because of all numerous intellectual property rights to plant material , which is therefore always restricted to restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , The O@@ ss@@ i , is a director of O@@ ss@@ i , has found herself in her doctoral thesis based on genetic variation in car@@ rot and their availability . she found out that about a third of all Car@@ rot features are being protected as intellectual property , making it either possible for plant bre@@ eders either or not only . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates are still not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ aging plants like wheat in still greater style are patented as salad or carrots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ i@@ wise
&quot; plants will be so far@@ med that they have targeted features - of such , by which their taste or their colour improves up to such , due to which they prosp@@ er in certain environments such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders has more patents decreases . genetic diversity is currently more than ever before , because the changes in climate change is much worse than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokes@@ woman Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States , the company applied for preser@@ ving the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not contradi@@ ct that intellectual property has other bre@@ eders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varied innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not block innovation , it does not promote innovation , it promotes more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on looks like that : for 20 years to wait until a patent loop , which certainly does not have innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long to be able to breed in plants , which are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , the struggle would have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources ever have been a general public and it should remain to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; that is what drives us , and it &apos;s impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on wants to be patented in the concept of creating plant characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants form it themselves and as bre@@ eders , we ultimately did not know how plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if a variety is breeding , there are also his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which cultivation of her@@ b@@ icides are needed , breeding in its varieties of this concept of farming . &quot;
my concept is ad@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move to international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they keep the patented or keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mort@@ on looks at Sal@@ ate at his breeding garden .
photo by Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ties : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , more powerful than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need to constantly keep new material for my catalogue , since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years before the competition , &quot; says he . &quot; &quot; with a patent for 20 years before the competition , it &apos;s pretty simple . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US seem to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , but the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which himself describes as professional organization in the field of resources , works the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to get to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organization Agre@@ co@@ l works at an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for the bre@@ eders differ from country to country , absent for the O@@ ss@@ i commitment can not be purchased one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Committee of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventi@@ onally far@@ med plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . this is why it permits the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conventional bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is possible to bring to the governments of the Member States to implement these new lines . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators of governments , non @-@ governmental organizations and seed companies from completely East Africa to experience something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsor@@ ing seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; Saat@@ ben@@ ign systems that the organization is currently launching a global alliance for &quot; open source &quot; plants for the planned next year . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit organization organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on Ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed card . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , Global Alliance for the Future of Ess@@ ence - a consortium of aid agencies , like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers could have an opportunity to exchange it and improve the seed companies to ensure a stable supply with food . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a varied , local care with seed crops for sustainable food systems - a connection , by the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that it will soon be seen more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods are especially respected , where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we try now to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ lock the Egyptian authorities content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government locked the website of the International Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , documented human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world as well as the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities on this step sharp and promised to continue efforts and efforts to continue human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ Network for Human Rights Information Re@@ b@@ ess - despite this attack and rein@@ forcement of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , which should not be so difficult to follow these goals and to return to victims of the world , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was not so important to overcome the sperm . we hope to keep our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is regarded as the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ language output of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of wave of we@@ ster@@ ings for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights activist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada took his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of colum@@ ni@@ sts and articles , which he writes in Egypt not available websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to avoid the T@@ ens@@ ur@@ ian Government of the Egyptian government , itself the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider with the also Zi@@ adas blog is home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he took over the student protests and took a video like the police physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly turning about politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; this , blogs to lock is very old , however , has not been a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the lock of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is managed to give me a feeling of evidence of evidence ; an arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading by the National Security Council , blocking Blogs , and any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have demonstrated that I didn &apos;t write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was a Archive for me .
first I used it to the post of articles in order to avoid c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; however , after they have locked him and they &apos;re afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the pattern go the way up to an end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 pages . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , among others Orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented the blocking of providers , through which the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we realized how to offer the locking of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s . &quot;
&quot; such a practice indicates the intention of the government , to continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation will additionally emb@@ ell@@ ished , that the cen@@ sored decisions behind closed doors are made , which means that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction , with which they can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .
&quot; the Brazilian army has been used in the fav@@ el@@ as in N@@ iter@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; days for day reports newspapers in Brazil with glo@@ omy headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs . &quot;
some of the headlines as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; every second day a police officer will be murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ ie@@ ves pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence reached the highest stand for 10 years in Rio . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager will find a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which she announced , a new section called &quot; &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to pass over crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual slavery , etc . all that happened from the ci@@ vil@@ ised standard and what only happens in Rio is the &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we don &apos;t close our eyes as a journalist . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ ess , chief editor of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure is : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist discovered the newspaper that there is a member of the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , which will be controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , when it is dist@@ orted , is also used to shoot tom@@ bst@@ ones of the police , which only shoot and then asks questions to fail . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and their partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm you ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed to call violence as &quot; war . &quot; this is the opinion of a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy through the media and might make it difficult to raise responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as an extra in the analysis of the military career in Rio itself - combined with insufficient investment in personnel , education and historical and self @-@ counterfeit negle@@ ct of public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : Rio de Janeiro , the federal state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; the most violent village in Brazil &quot; &quot; is false : &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 non@@ violent cities in Brazil are located in Brazil in the north and nor@@ theastern country . these are the most recent data available . &quot;
no such cities are located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we watch the Mor@@ dr@@ aten in the state , Rio is on No.@@ 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of non@@ violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP has actually protect against more reports about ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the term &quot; civil war &quot; by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio is also serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; this calls for the state on , means and ways to use the typical for a war . in addition , the penetration in the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; is a sharp point in the countryside , and to the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al@@ damage &quot; and &quot; ver@@ itable spher@@ es . &quot; &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ lib currently about a million Syrians in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack involving chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the life of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacres committed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have stood at the siege of Damascus under siege by Damascus , which led to local additives or control points out by tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of long block@@ ade , traditional food supplies such as meat has become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ weight , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the conventional , planted in Syria and are only extreme rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them very attractive food source for many residents of the besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the request of the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French Intelligence Agency AFP &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivation of pilgrims , because they have a high nutritional value , like meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years , this project began to participate in this project and expressed its relief that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ seam@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to mediate 125 family knowledge to pl@@ anting pilgrims , Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations on Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is reli@@ ed on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity for 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel short@@ ages , locally manufactured greenhouse gases are used from plastic to supply the altern@@ ators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila told Global Vo@@ ices that she began with the &quot; &quot; production of the regions of pilgrims &quot; &quot; before they checked out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have created a &quot; &quot; teaching position for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding of various reasons . &quot; fraction of siege arti@@ llery .

&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege are visible . &quot;
we want our experience people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand for Justice for the Vic@@ tims of 2017
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in Portugal &apos;s capit@@ als in Portugal and called for justice to the victims of fires , which stood in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two and forty persons died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to that the government of solidarity with the victims had a state of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were registered in Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ bur@@ sts in the northern and central regions of the country , and some 250 million hectares of forest and many villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June , Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande took a similar tragedy in June , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system , monitored the forest area per satellite recordings alone , there are approximately 500,000 acres of forest in Portugal alone - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
&quot; in order to make you a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation , there is no fire in 4 districts . &quot;
&quot; Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ ane ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared images :
this is Bra@@ ga today . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # F@@ og@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into the event :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protest of Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to enter the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
João So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything . &quot;
they did this Sunday nowhere : there are dozens of open streets that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy could happen in June , as the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permit in Ö@@ r@@ t@@ ages will be back with a high level of Bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the forest form , which had brought to the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , has been objec@@ ted by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government resulted in a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so everything could be built , &quot; João Sor@@ val will continue in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environment organisation Quer@@ cus made attention to the fact that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of slightly burning wood , is still spreading in a Teu@@ fel@@ ess , according to fires in this species . &quot;

&quot; during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years ago , a terrible war between the different mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups had broken off , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . Afghanistan became a country of terror and distress . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was heard in the G@@ haz@@ ni province in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then at that time , she knew that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy should break . &quot;
his uncle would fet@@ ch him and bring him to the tu@@ b@@ p@@ res .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the A@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara became suddenly protection . &quot;
the Taliban came closer to their hatred to Haz@@ ara known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape was A@@ shar@@ af returned in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a co@@ leg@@ ru@@ zzo . the work was hard and made him ill .
&quot; then he took up what was left about his low wages , and went into Iran . once again he was in a strange country along with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to earn his lifetime . &quot;
&quot; back then , like today , the life of Afghan refugees were influenced by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , where we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hanged n@@ ylon before the open windows that we don &apos;t open at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities had rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ r came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , went alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that divided twice a day of eating and needy . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high beam quot@@ as , but it is true that the conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Human Rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffering from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in more than 3000 &quot; special admission centres . &quot; these are impro@@ vised establishments in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a admission centre , if they officially have issued a request for asylum , which can deduc@@ t for months after the registration of the asylum request . &quot;
&quot; until then there are people who have no money to stay , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the road . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but A@@ shar@@ af helped to free himself soon from these conditions .
&quot; after several years had done various works in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel and a Schn@@ el@@ lim@@ s opened after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is &apos;s success story is now on the documentary &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury &quot; - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind the Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; some of the Afgh@@ ans @-@ operated companies were created in recent years , among them cutting sites , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ it@@ ers and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the story of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals are far beyond the Italian food industry and retail trade , and aim back to the country that he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forgot my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know my people suffers .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
&quot; they represent half the society , and they have to get the same possibilities like all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also indul@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preservatives . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepren@@ eur was a trip through un@@ certainty and doubts , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he would like to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
&quot; Ne@@ ti@@ ces Report : regulatory accus@@ ations from Egypt permit social networks Mah@@ moud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , since more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ti@@ zen @-@ Report is an international snap@@ shot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in the internet right &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a draft law , which provides that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months after the document entitled to register their full name , as well as their identification number . &quot;
&quot; those who failed this step could be sentenced to six months in prison , or the final comm@@ uting of a penalty . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was recruited by sixty members of parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee in Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another deputy was a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of pre@@ sidents or a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the pre@@ judi@@ ce of the pre@@ sidents and state facilities are already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , one such action would be imposed with prison and fin@@ es , as right @-@ wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , it can mean up to three years in prison for the convicted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; an distinctive example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) that was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while keeping violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup against the President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident , four years in prison on a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the sentence against human rights groups failed to put the def@@ endants from prison in the court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups are eng@@ aging , such as weapons of arms , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and an attempt to kill . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza discovered the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ ic activists join through @-@ through documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation by Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly engaged in a trans@@ lu@@ ded action plan . according to the plan , according to the plan expressly stated a controversial bill of law , business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , official amnesty would be rejected . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light to look like the pre@@ dic@@ tive plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nomin@@ ation of his sources under the article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press code that journalists protect the right to protection of their sources .
&quot; however , he appeared in the Tunis District Court on 9 May as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force to force social media users to introduce their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media need a permit before they write messages in social media or share . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration is indicated that the registration must be required with the full @-@ true name . &quot;
analysts predi@@ ct that by the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in entertainment within the social networks . it is now un@@ clear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese network citizens have suggested in the social media , this rules only sel@@ ective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
see you then in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia granted access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat to register as the organizer of the information spread .
&quot; this term is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government runs a list of online services that make the &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to remove the removal of contents and force them on request for the removal of user data . &quot;
&quot; websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ con@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ruled the blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to er@@ ase two English articles that supports Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked to the site , because it works &quot; &quot; one source of information that work together with groups to recru@@ it a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is completely blocked off the website . it is thus , besides other than China , one of the few countries around the world in which access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain may not stop to treat .
&quot; after this week , the British government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased security auth@@ orization to monitor the internet service provider to monitor communications in real @-@ time , allowing data encryption to control the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; however , the government has cons@@ ul@@ ted with telecommunic@@ ations and intelligence services , however , has left other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation process runs until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
