<seg id="1">"although I had visited the USA for at least once a year, I would now live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love of America is extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American films to read American authors and run American authors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist for the American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the Grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, who covered the murderous conspiracy of a oil-Magnaten in The Pelican letter, who had to occupy his interest in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it, as if it's the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only increased."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country where I have ever lived, whose variety is so inviting, that you are always the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very painful love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is surrounded with his narrow-minded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops with his opinion about the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his empt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes cast, which he won at the Republican election, was the highest number ever nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigrot person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not meet Trump and his voters in harmony with people that I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, Professor Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, the people from all over the world, a deep believing man, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"trumps worldview did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours to watch the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights for life long, and her husband Dave, my host family that treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped with much patience and arrogance, and helped me to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodied by them deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump met his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the equivalent to its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the argument with the idea that men voted for Trump, because they were either aware of his racism and fanatism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to describe the trump voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful and implies an inability to understand those that act on another way, and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most know, are voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that it has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they may say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the" Whitelash "(s).: as much as" Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities "; Word Game from white to the White and whiplash, which means that great Van Jones called it exactly what America has made so magnificent."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether the myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - which faith or background can always have, America is everyone welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to hell with verseness, religion freedom and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at Ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a job change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have been my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" he asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" No! "</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "cloaked the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no! they answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would someone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN"!</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan closed with the words: "God is thanks to Mr. Trump is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Land, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find no place in this new America.</seg>

<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the church, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexicos, is known for their drug abuse and the Banden violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after an accidental meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered so rare hopeliness.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very serious, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI comments:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to reflect their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"always come and play with shining eyes and play in the action you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically on the largest landfill of Asuncion in the capital - on instruments which are made from recovered waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with reprepared instruments which consist of local fixed waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>

<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez remembers a local oologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place, where the parents had no music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was something that he had never seen before: a herbage produced from waste.</seg>

<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that is targeted on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already been operated by the Iberian waters, illegitimate fishing before the other coast of Africa was sought."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were correspondingly raised over accordingly, and not inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind to their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries who simply refused everything", "Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered the ship wreath."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was removed from the waters of the region: it was not successful to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, for plundering of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects against criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"alongside Somalia and Madagascar members, the members of this network were driven out by the six countries that were driven out of their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "thus, we have eight countries who are working together and work together. they will change information and stand mutually illegally, where to get illegal fishing companies," says Tony Long, head of Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is by definition not regulated: what is caught, is hidden, absent for it extremely difficult to track. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing systems can damage, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing once were disabled through bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snow-empirio, the actions between individual countries, these actions happen in real-time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists existing licenses, news to suspicious activities or details that you noticed during a port inspection or experience."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they move on the open sea with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to mark the ships, which are in banned areas. even so suspicious passes can be discovered - such that a ship invites his fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies may show whether the involved ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly, if they have a criminal law."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing are likely to be able to accept such ships in their ports. what does the ships cannot be sold in their ports, and that they may even be forced to pay the numbers of penalties, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" it is about significant financial losses for the owners, which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile. "</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to reach," "says Per Erik Bergh, Senior Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a Beratero company that has been set up for the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supported FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to return an estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year because of illegal fisherman who penetrate Eastern African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish farms, which attracts the world's commercial fish catch from all over the world. among these also selfisheries."</seg>
<seg id="122">"these practices include promotions, such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, inscription of phasienames, fish protected species and fish in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeted by the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system", "says Long." "previously, a ship could fishing illegally and a country could say" You won't run my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. "and exactly this legale hole tries to close FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front work.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 examinations."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has been uncovered against criminal networks, which had fake licenses in Tanzania. discovered ships, which used several fraudulent identities and found it winged ships and found."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to his cooperation with INTERPOL, international authority to fight against crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing through large distances and receive."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our examinations take us quite far in the "" organised crime "," Bergh says. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, which is to help FISH-i suspects more precise ships."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which will always be developed further, helps to bring illegal ships to hide themselves."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "the Illegal fisherman use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position." "said Duncan Copeland, Music analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, allowing them to be ortable anymore by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland is therefore helping to build a system, which connects different information on information. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African Nations can actually affect the undoubtedly global issue of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Marine Protection organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed by the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who is doing what is doing - that makes simply sense," says he. "" here is a chance for countries to combine together and their resources for the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run as a global system the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are indications that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminal, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, previously fished without licenses and hardly to calculate consequences, are now aware that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now counted a 33% increase in fisheries turnover, since then fishing boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i started to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries have also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we will now also copy other countries", "says Kiilu." "we will disappear several hundred million dollars a year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. now they fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "safety is the goal, even more such initiatives and structures will also be created in other regions." "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia had its first big triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and were not allowed to use bad networks, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also enclosed in forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time, the evidence that such a special, collaborative work mode works for the protection of the oceans.

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation failed are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, one requires two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in our native language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the previous language - native language."</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French native speaker was translated from English to French in French - not by the French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may be based on lack of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively low number of English speakers that are Japanese to learn."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that have no foreign employees cannot be finished. then the Japanese staff, whose English-knowledge is considered the best to be considered to be a translator, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widely distributed - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrens and enigmatic phrases that arise through machine translation, show that this technique can not substitute for long any human translators. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulation in Japan, including the enigmatic pressure prints, which often uses T-shirts or bags, are used only from stilistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr-users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may still be harmless as jewellery still acceptable, or at least harmless. but from big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, documented by the northeastern Japan, daily Kahoku Shimpo who have reached progress made in the last six years to revive the life of those who were affected by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Miyagi prefecture. the Miyagi prefecture, had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring preventive Fukushima and Iwate were forced evacuated because the tsunami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, the Fukushima prefecture has already experienced a nuclear accident, already on that alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from local point of view which progress has been reached after six years to rebuild the lives of local support.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper involves both statistics of the Japanese revival authority as well as the survey results of the affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing estate in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwata"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (paragraphs, sac, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi could see the greatest success among the three prefectures, Miyagi could be completed here. 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were finished."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, whereas about 70 percent is the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"even six years after the catastrophic, evacuated from Behelfsu) has also been trying to relocate in final spare parts for six years."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple-catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in Behel's accommodations."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such housing."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful in 2011. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people were moved to stay in detention centers."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number here is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by the disaster, have opened its doors to December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 percent of fisheries harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now back in operation, only 30 percent of fisheries ports have resumed its operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"tsunami and nuclear accident, in the three prefectures agricultural land, have dragged a large extent in the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land areas, with only 66 percent of the arable land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the arable land used in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 acres of 5 400 hectares of cultivated fields of Fukushima, lie in the" nuclear wave zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, the tourism has recovered far back, but here remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again up to 90 per cent at the same stand as before the accident. Fukushima, however, can only be 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster has almost half the coastal inhabitants, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine a total picture, the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuated people. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and, as you will find themselves towards the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo led a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness under the local population in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local people have taken action, have taken action to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>

<seg id="576">"in its edition for the anniversary of the earthquake, Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the position of evacuated Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only experience the enormous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident, which had to be experienced in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated people from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were registered in the areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were moved back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live outside of their home-prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastropod, most of the evacuees are still working in Behel's accommodations. it is known that the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects are to be competing for building projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will be held in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to focus on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">"they only left the factories, which can produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">"the motives, which led to such measures, were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the surcharge on the global market."</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song of "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youths of First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them. they do with Hip-Hop thanks to a series of migratory workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"since 2014, as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, we have been creating mobile studio studios directly to schools and youth centres to accommodate youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live."</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten cree-communities and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop will thus increase the young participants in our conversations, such as cultural identity, language, meditation, love, self-acceptable, or whatever it comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"for example, this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kiteckalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called" Highway in tears, "to which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were waning or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="700">"the next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motive of a video player to convey, how important the receipt of traditional customs and customs, despite the influences of globalization."</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters do not always rule the languages of First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagician Cree First nation, the refrain is sung at Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">The students involved here received some help by Gary Jolly from the Northstars Hip-Hop Group to give them a Strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">"at the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan the strophe is available, as well as translation into English, translated here to German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever interested in me?</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">"that is the day, in which you will take our cry"</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we lost our way in life as youth</seg>

<seg id="752">"behind each strip, behind every bone in the hundreds of secret tombs, stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be used."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican News Portal Animal PolÃ­tico is called the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" with drug trafficking, ") which should give a voice to these victims and reports the stories between enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project so:</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it is not normal that my 10 year-old Cousin thinks that he is great. and it is not normal that people will hear songs on the" heroic "of offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone, and those who have fear that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories are to blown numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of human beings is incredible for me if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village might be justified, that they were able to rise."</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can I give it a possibility here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the story of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported a brief statement about Steven Bird's other initiative, the unmistakable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get the language diversity of great cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland, where TLS has been carried out events in the United States, where TLS has been conducted since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project are:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the world can be avoided, if we do cities, accept diversity - safe spaces, in which inhabitants don't have to be forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening, often these events are often associated to understand, instead" the listening to appreciate, to be able to link. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers enter their history first in their own language and then declare it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation will lead to the listeners."</seg>
<seg id="1146">"they call, laughter and emotions, be the language no longer a barrier."</seg>
<seg id="1147">"for example, the following video shows a traditional history of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round the storytellers Rassidatou Konate will also take the opportunity to explain the customs of stories for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the Fable of Hoses and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after having explained the importance of his findings, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is it that you don't understand a audience that does not understand your language? "with a wide grin, he shares his sense of exclusiveness:"</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook has addressed the word" Kalar, "or," "Kalar", "in burial writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread issue of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the ascent has been radically nationalist movements to the word an extremely worsened connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that usually used by Ultra Nationalists than hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to tackle hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' usually may be associated with racism today, but the word itself doesn't call itself automatically hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people reported that even Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the Word or expressed doubts about his use, were censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letters as well as other words such as' Kalar pae ',' Kalar Oat '(camel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>

<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" (ku) + the questionable (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different. "</seg>

<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Hs is the opinion that they will decrease hate speech radically nationalists, but also emphasized that Facebook needs to be analytic, before it extinguishes all the posts that disseminate racism in suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the Word automatically.</seg>

<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(spheres)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three nationalists who disseminate hate language, will receive a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the promotion has a strong signal to all, the hate language may disseminate the efficiency of this strategy."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of brass often have a cat and mouse game, with the user to use social networks, a new word or an alternative notation of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook started to erase his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' is banned by the social network:"</seg>

<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a good intention to reduce racism to Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">"for such words, there will only be more hatred within the different communities."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"when one of 56 clubs, which are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and is used for the exploitation of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas works for seven years with the help of their video camera at the discovery of practices, such as children's heiritioning up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and they have made it at the same time at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, which showed the Rohini in her discussion, acted by women who call her husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, with which women can easily identify themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to express the name of their husbands, a Bralso, which she pleaded not guilty to all, and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">"this tradition testified that a woman will respect her husband, and wish him a long life."</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman, who doesn't keep it, is regarded as a misfortune, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we've never had thought of this discussion on this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted to have her husband as well as the name of her husband, to try out at home, as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law mother and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned aside to me and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage Rohini started her first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate. "some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women attempted to raise the discussion with a practice in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us, means that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas of the village of Wallet in Maharashtra over the break of a centuries-old tradition in which women should never speak of their husbands "name."</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini is telling:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she had caught up during the whole practice, and another decided to allow him to release the whole frustration against him and his family by expiring him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in the Adrenalinward, with an old bridge, the women decided that they would actually try to call her husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they stopped their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a multitude of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini to and asked what ideas they put on women in the head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another prudent member decided to do it during dinner from the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"as her mother-in-law she touched me, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understandable and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the wearing of the zinnoberred Punch on the forehead, pointing to the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why must only women show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred dot, if he would do it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only and I listened to him, to bear him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not ended up completely, but mean that they are now in a better position to vote himself in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, discussion scrum is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we're doing a trip at each discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to worry about women, who might hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the past few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they dance and sang, talking about things about which they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"for so many years I have been working on these problems and yet, too, have some things, for example, such as our identities on our husbands, never said so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say, certain things can say, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we have been talking about the concept of honor and connected with clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have applied only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most is the okay, but some wanted an Salad-Kurta to bear a wide shirt above a trousers; they don't dared themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own warnings, morals are connected to the Saris and much more, swollen Rohini her own couple Kurtas (upper block) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can bear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"referring to the question of whether in the five months since its first discussion of discussion, Rohini confirmed that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then we stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, make it still, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; one or two women are now taking Zinnoberred at their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion scapse know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - how to reach more freedom of movement or their own hanger - at the end of a difficult to navigable river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us, gives us the confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman go home in the club and what else we are talking about what we are doing and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from undressed groups in India and do videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Justice Minister K. Shancourgam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has caused a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of a meeting of the international branch of the State Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they are compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be regarded as a town.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit an error.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog of Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to defend the logic, to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and efforts to create this valuable land, you can say that we were not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the certificate of a flight before the responsibilities, a compulsory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons for Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of whose appearance he appeared irrefly."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently being led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as you reach the key point of the subject, the good old surrounds of the authoritarian seizabers, emerged, abandoned logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final effect, during the last week of Shanmugam, answers to his American guests concerning our press, our Judikative, our political system truly non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions he offered with non-responses rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam, his opinion, because she didn't understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if it was highly paid to be part of the government of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog posted his comment, he shows that it should start with the criticisms of the conference, that you could better understand the context of the statements by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"as he said that Singapore is rather a" "city" "as a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so unfavourable, even if we are looking forward to free and appropriate elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He missed Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said that Singapore," "No country," he did not mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan displays his disappointment about Shanmugam as leader of a herent-growing generation that makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am talking about what the Justice Minister of Singapore has said it very much...</seg>

<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not sure if he really believes that he is aware of what he defended."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"in the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Braachula he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59- year-old Mexican, a small woman with a coral pink Brillenivory frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many among the name Mom Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are on the transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 Dollar the night sleeping the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbled walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signs to the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells us, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present, it's rather quiet, but in this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms that some have slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"they also helps them, and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them medications that they can't pay, they massive them with a balm that used them from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived from a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa would be a reasonable first name for Mrs RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a Joghurtee) posing with ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answered with a smile." I really feel it suits her, because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very lovingly good.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston in order to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans, which are on the way to the United States to make a normal stop in South America and then go towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other way accompanied by Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the route," explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitians and Africans are often going to travel together, and that the Africans speak on WhatsApp by Ms. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his approach, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football worldcup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy weakens, he began his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest in Mum Africa for months: it sells SIM cards to save the necessary money, to buy the Bustuet to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact RamÃ­rez's future in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mum Africa is our mother and we never let it go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests will often send text messages when they went, to grate them or to report her about the course of their trip."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the impulse of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"they don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chickens as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez may be very well known here, but it is not the only lack of hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a sasse leads to JesÃºs Valencia."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenela and his family received migrants in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and found that the Bustuets are sold to many African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleeping on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking site outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencian states that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border via the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was referred to the United States after a raid on his work."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">"JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to cape him, without having a plan."</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation, and a unknown, one allotting, has offered her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives, and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, the traveler consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a majority of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy about her that her house is full, but it is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she finds her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair lovers, who made her a spin, some photos of their grandchildren and many travelers more, young and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she imagines me briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang of Twitter users, micro-scale."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"Xinjiang residents, a ethnic minorities region in the West of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone alert when it shows the District government, to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning"). "</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app will say that the app is to get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities did not use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because she, shortly after they had installed the app, news with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the announcement of the police, the app would determine that the app would determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom. "</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking of pornographic websites, by online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users to be aware how much time they spend online and to remote control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can naturally be used in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "state or even hacker able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while announcements via digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in major cities in the east and south, the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme tougher and surveillance measures as well as routinemissing Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the media-based media outlet" Images from Mainland China "(one of the studios has published on Twitter, showed photos from a checkpoint, in which policemen were able to reprove that they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">Authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang-App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered at a Checkpoint using a device without these software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">That is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"people are forced to use devices that are thought for older people, to use."</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (a number of persons), also published a jingwang product description, which indicates that the software can lift the license requirements of a Windows operating system and thus receives unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">"in Jingwang, the provisions in Jingwang possibly have a reaction to the instructions of the town council, to minimize the spread of illegal content."</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and with the party related institutions including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity Office in operation of their computer and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also referred to these new surveillance methods:"</seg>

<seg id="1990">"the intention is obvious to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants, and gives them penalties for a whole number of other possible prevention, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smoking a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib brings much of his time inside; once again he turns into his screen, time to his computer, back and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what can be abandoned, a cigarette between his fingers, or his nicotine lips can be discovered."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced his occupation of the West Bank, which she had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyees (approximately: farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now Hdaib is a passionate activist, which is the conservative majority opposite to gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapesmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also demands the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics do not only find in its hometown Amman reevance but also in cities that suffice from Damascus in Yemen to the whole of Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his thinking, and he can feel noisy with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he doesn't open it openly, he gets a special consideration against the U.S. foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib viewed his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to do in war zones, to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian skirt of second generation, "even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own life states," emphasizes Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so, because I am a man, while he dissolved in water, Nesadan. it is the holy month Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the pieces of tepid coffee and the scales of the Kent-cigarette in the nose is first of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"in the meantime, Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially when looking at a glance into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">Hence it avoids easy to do fundamental things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to land not in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan had cancelled a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila to the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some parliamentary groups that support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual Frontiers Hamed Sinno to oppose the cultural and traditional norms of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"in an interview with CNN, the Euro MP Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert was" straight "to be cancelled due to sexual orientation of the scary."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim, the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism, which represents the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila embraced the Jordanian people as a progressive supporters of human rights, who continue to continue to use an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to be rhetoric, but it is actually a clear-crystalline reality in Jordan, which is clearly reflected in Hdaibs plant."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib's traditional Gender norms came back to body by declaring his vision of the fate of Arabic women who have vorehelichen sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a obviously crushed woman, whose arms and legs can stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those they should actually trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, the number of honour of honour has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch, according to Human Rights Watch, reached its peak in 2016; however, the number of honour is missing in the year 2016; however, Jordan became the institutional infrastructure to support the women who tried to support murder or domestic violence to support appropriate species."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the unbreakable control of the year 1954, women who are exposed to the risk of familiar violence as well, and for their release is often a year-long bureaucratic service as well as the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will happen nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity and is known for it, too, not to repudiate topics that are long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denying that his work is politically, however, he grants that his music, which is full of explicit claims to sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be able to separate politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, husband."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he was dreaming of politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa 'ed" Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically on the core, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib published a song with the title" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can, in his words," that can be, "whether faith or non-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noticed that hardly anyone says in Jordan on the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals still were censored in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, later to notice that his comments were torn from the context, revolted and censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a reworked version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance against homosexuals is not dismissable to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nua, a poet from the eighth century, who still remained in memory thanks to his homootic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat, who should work on behalf of the Caliph, was openly able to write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do not believe it?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Irish Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government is rehabilitated on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices be brought to silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service adopted several former government administrations and members of the teacher's teaching committee, with the reasons, they had agreed on comments in social media, which impose corruption in the country with the deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of what is the show of Hdaibs, only the tip of the iceberg, according to the actual challenge, is a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a permanent strapping and take place. Jordan has denied Mashrou 'Leila now for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is made of slow, beditor and inner changes. it is certain that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society take place."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreaming not only to bring his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will dominate the region by music, art and literature of a true and fundamental openness - and not through bombs, spreading unitions and an artificial way to run democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time is done, Hdaib will continue to grow and consequently resist resistance."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the processed version of the" "Liebesschists" "guerrilla fighters," published the International Online Magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This post is published in a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who can outfit themselves, to bring in affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was exactly the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the foundation Bogothe and Cristian Palacios from the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) which encourages young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was the scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had closed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signatory of the peace agreement was considered so significant that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of Colombia, there is still a long way until you speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a military rhetoric, and around the clock they had to integrate their weapons to the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which itself accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, had accustomed for guerrillas in some cases, and support them in its ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the Young Colombia would have to be joined together and the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love botanical extracts of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them again in the company.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The campaign of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters - which should then be handed over to personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the Campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the reconciliation of Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to speak short with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love human beings, who we love to write on Valentine's Day, but those who need to need a lot more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he continued to share his love with people in this year and needed the most urgent additives."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to build a new life." "letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a history of peace", "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2,000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never thought that someone would be forgiven</seg>
<seg id="2202">"the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in Caldono-Cauca, on 19th March."</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation of Bogotway to persuade the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC introduced themselves as they had done before to oppose the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters full of submissions from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it is incredible how many different feelings are going through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, and told the political scientist Jimela JimÃ©nez Avila. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after having passed the letters, a former fighter led me through the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomegranates, a fatal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I said to him," Hello, what are they doing? "he answered," I answer a letter which someone has written to me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It 'a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has written me something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and set me beside the pomegranates."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions to be this dampers, and would help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had something different from life than war. himself was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of starvation. "I would never thought that someone would forgive for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside, the open arms waiting for us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned only how I must deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start, students and some leader of the FARC came together to a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all raised as early as the war, and the FARC already acted in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore the leader of the FARC was the story of the organization, their ideas and gave insight into their views over the peace process:" for many years, we witnessed how the social injustice on the entire Colombian people can help us to create a political party, we can help to create the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a target of this size, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to this people who had never heard any hearing yet, and to recognize that people, which I often saw as a monster, and even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned out through their life circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and caused much damage to bring us something, and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered on the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"for example, in Caldono-Cauca, Gustavo de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of Cali, wrote the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"in Colombia, Colombia has made sure that after deforestation peace would rule peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise, and to protest their rights, and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call for all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they hear - to rise across all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, because we know from my own experience that nothing is simple. among us that defend life as foundation of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2252">"when they were grown up, you became aware that Chechnya was not a safer place for them, why they went to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after having experienced a group of the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt was opened to Sabrina."</seg>
<seg id="2254">They came out of fear for her life last night in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer Helferan in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I told me that somebody needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a tranwoman that was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>

<seg id="2260">Afterwards the photos of my documents took the round through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was doing just a few grocery bags from the back of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned myself, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt me."</seg>

<seg id="2293">"at the time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it was clear that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-right friends crossed the numbering plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you see?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give their names, but I want to remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something unexpected happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her, without writing me, without notice, without everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a foreigner.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe in safety, only because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you plug. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is # 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality. however, this is a taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"a few traditional Caucasian elements, I still bear in me."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so very much I wish it, this seatic barrier I can not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really give me effort to consider how the person reminds us of her past, that is why my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have stayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed more information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has spent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock up a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that I may download them, they probably invite the relatives to take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honour "by blood is experienced."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now gay men held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">"Sabrina: a friend of me says, there were just not many."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no relatives or they were dropped by their relatives to settle Kadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there so that you can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not just disappeared, but targeted to radicalize himself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is it just a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just have been imprisoned for one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people have disappeared in this prison, after having grown beard."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even involved when these men were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as a bandits, there were no reports yet. but we would suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have been allowed to shave this man?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and designs of people, who heard a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already in 2003, I was already well known, when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally intended to lead us to the" civilisation, "but ultimately kicked us back into the stone time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were slipped, I had painted eyelashes, wore RÃ¶hrenjeans and a short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Sharia's security department has never been curved to me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where there were several benches, and all the city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redeemer: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "Spotte does not know about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"they often say often to children, when they have fun over sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply locked her eyes before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"never offended me, never stranded and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long kept this gifts time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow joined the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but rather than the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could sense how people began in the city to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"he who had geled and laughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in the time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily slimmer."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity will you go after?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I unify them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetries, compositions, I giite her to the hospital, and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't miss a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered this people as a fluent variety.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"that is, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that's exactly the same as chase, who want to do with foam before your mouth, that there is no tail with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestans have those who have the Kabardiner who have Russians also; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men out of the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practiced Muslims who go into the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"do you know, many think about Transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experience. but that's a guardian angel."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel me in my own skin, and not ashamed to my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not very sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, which is based in a vast majority of Iran-based Arab Ahwazi community, was shaken by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult to deny their living."</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was an object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, in spite of equal education, women still earn less money than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strict observation, if it's about doing what they are doing with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women are sooner or later in various sectors of life to a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on the many different countries and creators."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of this and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"nevertheless: if I come to talk to skin color, on racism, on black cis women, to black women in the LGBTIQ-community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I say, what kind of feminist and verbal women, many white Feminist and white intersectional feminists have been silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all women agree that women - all women - should come together to sing" "their voices," "Kumbaya, my Lord 'to sing the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it that in addition to sexual violence, there is an institutional form of motivated violence that there are black women to be exposed to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or beyond that black women and women of other ethnicities and arrivals are less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with migrant background are more frequently referred to as a white girl, because of obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black Sphar and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want all women, all men and all men, neither skin colour that have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider the white woman who refuses to take into account for both the sex as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and won't fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spheres, who always turned me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, in their speech, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain a ideology in which the black woman is in historical ways, a deserted and marginalised beings."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I feed myself, to join me groupings, who also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egoeccentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to settle white women the importance of overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to be a home to women of different Herons and to marrow from white Feminism, the word" Feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully and to get rid of feminism and to use me the movement of the Womanism which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of a white-feminist paradigm, which is so hard to be celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever before, that we will define black women in our own ideas and we are going to be created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the Book of Africana womanism: as we can withdraw ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: as we can withdraw ourselves, in which they can defend ourselves in this way, in which they can be revered to our own way, in which they can be revered to the spiritual, spiritual, physical, physical and even the spiritual elements."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, I ask you about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my being as a woman as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither exaggerated, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine which reports special about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content-sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"Maikel Nabil Musa returned to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in canoe - with a particular concern through the Kurdistan Regional region. its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river which we had lost, I was still a child," "Musa told."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of the war, construction of reservoir, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and revised version of the article" "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" "from Kurturally. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# vlichenvirginity), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to the protection of the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"Ada BÃ¡ez said that she was nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, a little time has passed and the police said that their statement would be laid to the acts, but they could not do more."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another wife of Balbuena was found because of abuse, also the aktener display of Ada BÃ¡ez has nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman returned its ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">"to break the vicious circle of violence against women, is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women don't want to refund it at all, they are generally not receiving support by the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women also depend on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit victims of violence as well as the prosecution authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Intuition 1 strokes and Statistic 2 Invisible Missions and a legal system that nothing undermmed 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, flawed implementation of strokes and statistics "</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women really are mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various reports and reports that show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Office of Attorney, 9600 ads went to domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came by women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads due to domestic violence at peace offerings. 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women reported that they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics show not the true magnitude of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually displayed." every woman who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, are 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for every woman who will not be refunded because of physical abuse, two women, who do not do this, declared it at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not a separate criminal law, the prosecution authorities cannot be adequately documented, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases, in which women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning, they didn't want to do that, but then, however, she was supposed to repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but for two years she brought the psychological violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most notable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women, because they are fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook, where they described his insults and several attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated it."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long by Carlos and left him not earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like, as wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least one certain complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that her former partner is mistreated them."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo CREO network ("I believe you") that consists of women that are all in any way victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can speak with others about their experience, listening to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally reported on the website Ensia.com, a magazine which reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been a salad of the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as outsourcing, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was only given through its own income and the question how many salaries can get it."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for certain characteristics as resistance to diseases, a special red or green leaves or croached leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years more, more of such patents have been filed for more plants such as cereal or carton varieties. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security in order to ensure the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of millennia old tradition, Morton still has a salad, but he now needs longer because his work is always worth more constraints forever."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like I would lie in a river a boulume that I must get herring.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it is a split with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents will go on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salaries, because all characteristics are already patented. so it's so good as possible and tries to breed those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and tried to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition, he has also joined a movement that is becoming increasingly larger in the United States and everywhere, Open Source Breeding (" Open Source "Source)."</seg>

<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds like this, as if the movement from the IT area should come from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"open source Seed Initiative (initiative for" open-source "seeds) can be inspired by the motion for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are usable permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"within the framework of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit to ensure that others can be used by them farmed crops."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to make stores and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed it, to crucify it, and not immediately uttered - two aspects that are prohibited by many plant patrons."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for emeritus Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of seeds and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seed plays a role in larger interaction such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to breed latter with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "if you want to buy good, locally and sustainable food industry, it should also know that the species is farmed in the farm markets, should also know how this vegetables is farmed."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereign, undoubtedly, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of Open Source Seed Initiative is committed to undertake other seed further to their seed. in contrast, seeds and plant characteristics are patented."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi Supporters argued that the future of food supply may be at risk, as the self-contained genpool because of all numerous intellectual property rights to plant material, which is therefore always restricted to restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, The Ossi, is a director of Ossi, has found herself in her doctoral thesis based on genetic variation in carrot and their availability. she found out that about a third of all Carrot features are being protected as intellectual property, making it either possible for plant breeders either or not only."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates are still not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaging plants like wheat in still greater style are patented as salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visiwise</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be so farmed that they have targeted features - of such, by which their taste or their colour improves up to such, due to which they prosper in certain environments such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders has more patents decreases. genetic diversity is currently more than ever before, because the changes in climate change is much worse than ever before."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokeswoman Carly Scaduto recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and crucial for Monsantos. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture in the United States, the company applied for preserving the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it does not contradict that intellectual property has other breeders, since" patents and the protection of plant varied innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not block innovation, it does not promote innovation, it promotes more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks like that: for 20 years to wait until a patent loop, which certainly does not have innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long to be able to breed in plants, which are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, the struggle would have already been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources ever have been a general public and it should remain to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what drives us, and it's impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton wants to be patented in the concept of creating plant characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form it themselves and as breeders, we ultimately did not know how plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" if a variety is breeding, there are also his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with big farms and monocultures, for which cultivation of herbicides are needed, breeding in its varieties of this concept of farming."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is adorable. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move to international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents have to survive the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they keep the patented or keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks at Salate at his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the avoidance of plant patties:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, more powerful than a company that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need to constantly keep new material for my catalogue, since I know my competitors can sell my varieties in a few years before the competition," says he. "" with a patent for 20 years before the competition, it's pretty simple. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the US seem to be a leader in the" open source "breeding, but the concept spreads rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which himself describes as professional organization in the field of resources, works the centre with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties to meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organization Agrecol works at an" open-source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for the breeders differ from country to country, absent for the Ossi commitment can not be purchased one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Committee of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventionally farmed plants should not be patentable. this is why it permits the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventional bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is possible to bring to the governments of the Member States to implement these new lines."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, to farmers, operators of governments, non-governmental organizations and seed companies from completely East Africa to experience something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards sponsoring seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "Saatbenign systems that the organization is currently launching a global alliance for" open source "plants for the planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit organization organization USC Canada and the Action Group on Erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed card."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, Global Alliance for the Future of Essence - a consortium of aid agencies, like the WK Kellogg Foundation, published by McKnight Foundation and others - a report published that farmers could have an opportunity to exchange it and improve the seed companies to ensure a stable supply with food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a varied, local care with seed crops for sustainable food systems - a connection, by the Luby von Ossi hopes that it will soon be seen more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods are especially respected, where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we try now to make people clear that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend of August 5, the Egyptian government locked the website of the International Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), documented human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world as well as the Arab world."</seg>

ANHRI was not so important to overcome the sperm. we hope to keep our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is regarded as the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-language output of the Huffington Post and Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider with the also Ziadas blog is home, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he took over the student protests and took a video like the police physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly turning about politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"this, blogs to lock is very old, however, has not been a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the lock of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It is managed to give me a feeling of evidence of evidence; an arrest, attempted murder, unloading by the National Security Council, blocking Blogs, and any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have demonstrated that I didn't write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was a Archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to the post of articles in order to avoid censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and they're afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The pattern go the way up to an end.</seg>

<seg id="2743">"AFTE documented the blocking of providers, through which the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we realized how to offer the locking of websites, the VPNs."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice indicates the intention of the government, to continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally embellished, that the censored decisions behind closed doors are made, which means that the Egyptian population has no jurisdiction, with which they can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2890">"back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees were influenced by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, where we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon before the open windows that we don't open at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without Papers in Iran and made ready for the journey to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
