this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard from Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which it was spectacular , that the NSA has illegal teleph@@ ones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a disast@@ rous US intelligence service , in which the CIA passed Iran literally on a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but you know who didn &apos;t really liked the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has established against R@@ isen and called him to call his alleged springs . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he was promoted to the symbol of the government of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and to discuss journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitu@@ tions , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media does not get this information , and if they can &apos;t protect the identity of the mu@@ tigen , they are reas@@ onably priced . &quot;
&quot; so , when the government in R@@ isen was ank@@ le , he did something that many brave reporter did already do before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was living with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , though , for years that it would be essential to their fall , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the rep@@ orters and springs can hide themselves less .
&quot; rather than fail@@ ing with fail@@ ures and to make statements , you could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , concerned his telephone conversation , &quot;
&quot; just like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its lending , and even travel tips with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and risk of risk to condemn . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer at his request , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condem@@ ns more than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now , you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is home to much of their work as ge@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we set the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has always has more opportunities to pron@@ ounce all . &quot;
&quot; but just like the technology of the government allowed the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources even better . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can take this from the moment when they contact us , rather than in the night , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which was not yet written when R@@ isen has written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source closing system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the internet famous , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just like the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; you can also upload documents or send documents , as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot pro@@ cure more information , and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available from pre @-@ pri@@ ori . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments develop new spy technologies throughout the world , all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is easy to ensure that not only technology professionals such as Edward Snow@@ den do have the opportunity to place mis@@ ery . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers , and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental worker , the alarm for the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t performs . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies have not only been made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on April 3 2016 the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that the rich and m@@ ess &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous money sum@@ s in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by a declaration . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness by a statement . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents built in Panama &apos;s local law firm Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a small gli@@ mp@@ se into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will receive a impression of what customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ a@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you judge that ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has stepped down .
there are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad has written bonds in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead over a narrow friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others , which are nervous for the next release , and to the next reveal documents . &quot;
&quot; now , it sounds like the plot of an agent or John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel . &quot;
&quot; it sh@@ es away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and M@@ igh@@ ty are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians are discussing such secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , to hide and waste their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I imagine it always like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so , one company has one company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans now , who came to this scandal in these revel@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; now it is not so , that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ lem Fon@@ se@@ ca has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a look at the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs to provide less information to start a company than to get a library ID . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed an employee of training districts to go to school children .
it has been allowed to slip especially vulnerable investors .
&quot; it is this kind of behavior , that affects us all . &quot;
&quot; here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice . &quot;
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 Bar Association in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African minister , the susp@@ ect money to the US wanted to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it really sho@@ cked us that all until a lawyer decided on our investig@@ ator how to transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all prec@@ urs@@ ors . none of these attor@@ neys took us as clients , and of course no one was given to him money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to regard this as single cases .
it is not possible to submit a single lawyer from our investig@@ ative investig@@ ators .
&quot; it does not go to a single top pol@@ iti@@ ker , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
&quot; this may sound everything very comfor@@ ting , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing ever had changed ; as if it will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but , as a born optim@@ ist , I see that quite a lot started to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen demonstrations to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron , at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has been in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really stands behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the USA stuck behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ents , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
&quot; for us at Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for changes . &quot;
&quot; we need ordinary people who can fur@@ ious , if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind illu@@ stri@@ ans . &quot;
we need executives in the business that rise up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business .
&quot; we need leading politicians who realize the problem , and use them to complete this type of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the in@@ transparency , which now allows this type of tax fraud , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story how I had ab@@ duc@@ ted almost and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I completed my design studies , I made a rear sale . &quot;
one guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans this . I don &apos;t want to land away in the trunk of an Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small car boot !
then I heard me saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get broken down ? &quot;
a game of wild sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of the bed , to the door to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he wasn &apos;t mad at all .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me , depends on his class@@ room today . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my eye angle completely .
&quot; perhaps people who were sold in childhood as strangers were , actually friends who were waiting for being found only on it ? &quot;
&quot; to lodge in my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost ple@@ t , my ro@@ omm@@ ates will be raised and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it easier to transform in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new fellow @-@ mates Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I missed something like this . our apartment will stay with a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , with a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a site and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars .
&quot; they thought it super , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure to decor@@ ate our cheese ham o@@ mel@@ ettes completely differently because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest at the castle , Brian and I fell to the castle . &quot;
&quot; we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time , and we could pay for our rent ? &quot;
things came in rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to investors : &quot; we would like to create a website , on the people publicly accessible pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of rooms , whose doors are closes when visiting . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
&quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would ign@@ ite .
but did not do it .
&quot; no one who is still at consol@@ ation , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned all that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if one has a problem , one can spy on the things that is good . we could design@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create imm@@ en@@ ant trust between people who never met before . &quot;
can design afford such things ?
is it possible to create with design trust ?
&quot; I want to give you a cost sample , which degree trust we stri@@ pped . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you from your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I want to un@@ lock your mobile phone . &quot;
type your un@@ locked mobile phone on your left seat .
this quiet start of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the first time .
for the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most of you feel the responsibility .
so the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; only so , who actually has Al Go@@ res cell phone ? &quot;
&quot; could you tell us , on Twitter , to announce that he is the President of the President ? &quot;
they can now return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had to be presented with his name only once , where he would have told how his dog or his children be called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments which are saying : &quot; he can really hold a very well locked cell phones !
how would you feel then feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ kept feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to give negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given to their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we studied with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined how likely that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust the people most who are similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ ference .
exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation among the common@@ alities .
&quot; thus , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots . &quot;
&quot; moreover , we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reas@@ onably priced . &quot;
here are the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you say too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; as for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted too . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , such as &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your home ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design ? make this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips to what topics you should write anything .
&quot; our entire company is based on hope , that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers . &quot;
&quot; with what we were not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay this pre@@ judi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; here , you see how many people take our offer . &quot;
you can recognize three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that was not covered before .
for us the business is very good for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything runs smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who celebrated un@@ allowed parties and have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . so hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of An@@ ru@@ fer , and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of 123 had only once had a fraction of 123 million . &quot;
for people trusted in one another .
&quot; if confidence works , can be created . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host came into the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend due to sitting activities in heart attacks . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian that save one &apos;s life even though they don &apos;t know it right .
&quot; they drive a hospital in the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to get lon@@ ely , they bring books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra charge .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; that is , of course , not every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s going to have a business trade .
&quot; but just to name &quot; rental industry , &quot; the thing is not just right . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
humans place a part of itself and that changes everything .
&quot; it is efficient and reliable , but it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would be , however , if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if in any place , the one we visited , a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a pub @-@ block district , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could cook a 5 @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would like apartments of reason for sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have to receive the thought of common share ?
&quot; I imagine the cities which allow us society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and irrit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces found in the government , &quot;
&quot; now residents were offered now . students who were looking for a stay , were offered &quot;
&quot; were convey@@ ed in people whose children were gone out . In@@ cub@@ ator programmes were started , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . via our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be participating in 191 countries by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why didn &apos;t we work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the existing components . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deeper pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about that when a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
of course we know that design cannot solve every problem .
&quot; but if we could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you view me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a terrorist act , a terrorist act ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the airport at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media represent the media which look like me . &quot;
a study showed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims .
people do not speak with their car@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met Muslims , it &apos;s great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee holders -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a se@@ al@@ ant fitness fan@@ atics ;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided that .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as homos@@ exual man , as some of my friends , but as the Muslim . I decided to bear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lu@@ ch@@ ow was : it was for me a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old felt to fit me a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have a Koran with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , set in question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that pro@@ found@@ ly deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone makes you perc@@ ei@@ ving you complete , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the fundament@@ ally the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , looked at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people spread out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the deeds of others from one citizen in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I was silent -- as we were silent -- so low it went into my seat , and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved in this night into our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw , and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; Stay in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Keep you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims were gathered to prayer . &quot;
&quot; again , war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ able , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were fighting for Muslims , into the free and struck . &quot;
there really was bran@@ ces in mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
&quot; because people who attacked this land , attacked our country . &quot;
I swe@@ pt the rage of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want Muslims contam@@ inate and close mos@@ ques .
they talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
the question arises : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or good ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is located as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all the Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but an important organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , sac@@ s and Olymp@@ ion@@ ers . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America secure ?
perhaps there will be a few parking spaces but not stop the terror .
&quot; regular visit to a mosque leads to people other faith toler@@ ant , and show more ci@@ vic participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , it has found that it begins online . as the first the person is cut off from their community , that the person believes that the terrorist group has ab@@ hor@@ red the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ideology , is a tra@@ itor or faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; after all , a group of the IS was justified with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a man , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would like to add ourselves to their pre@@ sides if they recognise it as a representative of 1.6 billion .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you throw a look at them , they do not drive out what they are in &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is its brut@@ ality , which they can read these things into the Scri@@ ptures . &quot;
an outstanding I@@ mam told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because they were curtain to join the IS . &quot;
I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . any spiritual , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence and said to her that their anger , her mind to un@@ righteousness in the world , would only bring it into difficulties . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger , she was a main goal for the instrumental alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who spoke one solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and their church .
&quot; rather than acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways for a real shift in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS . &quot;
that was an insight into the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies show -- show : if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept rather a authorized government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if you report test persons news in which negative about Muslims were reported , they have more military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the lead @-@ up of the war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; in fact , it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to ex@@ ert the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear does not harm us . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was in the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person he knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her CV . she was bl@@ ended and said :
&quot; when did my young man become such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ zanne &apos;s brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting the afternoon in the afternoon . he did in her home , as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he dropped eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be moral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we gone to the mosque or we stayed home safely ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not easy decision , because that America we would like to leave our children : one that we may control us through fear , or one where we can pract@@ ise our religion free . &quot;
we decided to go to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and my shoes went out , went into the building hall , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement to thank and welcomed our guests , because half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to join us but to join us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I am broken together . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion pan@@ icked and pre@@ judi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or are you connected to those who think : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you think about those who think you have a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a thought with deep dive to work in a no@@ ok thinking factory , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; looking at the Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims in the whole world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people appear as a rule , often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what began as a platform for Bast@@ ers , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for professional dr@@ ones . it is possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before air packages start into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France live a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago she began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flying panels reach high speed and acceleration on the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; you have learned to deal with bur@@ dens , with turbul@@ ence and react in general public laws . &quot;
today we want to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to create a system autonomous , it needs to be colle@@ c@@ tively knowing where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; we use a new location technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board , what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; and landing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight machine , which tries to beat two flies with a f@@ lap . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient in the down@@ ward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most starters , it can ho@@ ver , and so great benefits in start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a flip side . &quot;
a limitation of tail@@ or is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ence as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is , that the air@@ machine doesn &apos;t matter which the optimum position can be obtained , and the achievement can be improved . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often present basic abstract issues that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be for example : what is the smallest possible number of mov@@ able parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about machines with a thousand mot@@ ion@@ ed parts that were joined together to viol@@ ate you .
&quot; ago , a trained pilot controlled flight equipment could fly , which had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear wheel . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remot@@ ely used flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although mechan@@ ics is simple , happening in the indoor life very much , so it can fly stable , and can move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorith@@ ms of the stern . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to throw it exactly if I see all , is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in enjoyment , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etri@@ cal .
that is why he is equivalent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the great skill skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is shot or even like he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; a lot is possible in models , the rest is learned directly with flying . &quot;
let us see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller machines .
this turns on clock@@ wise
and the others counter@@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds it together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ru@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further when it is restricted . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by being able to do a half .
the last demonstration was syn@@ onymous with synthetic sha@@ des .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ ru@@ ter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; each unit knows where space is , and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the particularly safe machine as it wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us there is a reward in the development and the p@@ act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that it allows creative , wise tastes to form it in so spectacular manner . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i .
thank you very much .
&quot; more than 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are getting faster and faster , you turned the mass of three son@@ es in a tenth of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for those short moment , they lighten@@ ed more brigh@@ ter than all stars in all galax@@ ies of the universe . &quot;
it was a very big Kn@@ all .
&quot; their energy , however , set it not in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ feeling itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
&quot; about 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell living on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; 25 years ago , a group was decided to build a group especially brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ger from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a huge laser det@@ ector to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise about black holes . &quot;
most of them kept crazy .
but enough people recognized it as mad geni@@ uses that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of anger , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ ri@@ omet@@ ri@@ al ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; during the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could significantly improved what improved performance was enormous . &quot;
so let &apos;s call it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clari@@ fy some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the commissioning of the detector , gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ di@@ ating black holes passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; they went through you , and me &quot;
and through the detector .
Scott Hughes : just two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my suffering is father .
&quot; basically , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
all that I worked for what I worked is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he has been investig@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational waves like Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is an exhau@@ sting in the emotions of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content will expand into one direction and stri@@ ped into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity was often a really al@@ ber@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; for example , on 14 September , for example , each of us stretched out the waves and stri@@ ped off . the strain of an average people was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this reason one explained the Lig@@ o staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , which is already absurd , this length would be accurate to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear bomb . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic textile about Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , the hunt for the waves like this : &quot; the technical difficulties when constru@@ cting such detectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; physi@@ cists are fin@@ anci@@ ally and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
return to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o is more one ear than one eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite convenient , because you can produce a picture or map of things by taking the light around you . &quot;
in killing is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you a lot of : &quot;
about the face of your child .
&quot; instead , we l@@ ur@@ red for certain characteristics such as pitch and level , rhythm and volume , to close the history behind . &quot;
&quot; right now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob supp@@ ress them . &quot;
&quot; number Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can &apos;t make any easy pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but by contrast to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can hear their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern in shots , we can hear the all literally . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ tion simply : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turning the two bodies very fast , one stops the same cir@@ cled with an additional pitch of sound . that sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu : &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement of movement , shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; Sur@@ render of the sound &#93; J@@ n , who knows what he must hear , recognizes this as sound from -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 times the mass of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : we are thinking about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine this force .
fantastic .
and we know it because we have heard it .
therein lies the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore Al@@ ls as they never before was possible .
on this way we can listen to the All and the In@@ visible .
many in all we can see -- practical or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ aging stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur , but in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see as these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as if it is transparent glass . I &apos;d like to search for the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , because the urine is veil@@ ed through its own ref@@ g@@ ings . &quot;
using gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I &apos;m optimi@@ stic that in all things we &apos;ve never seen we will never see and of which we don &apos;t have any idea that we can only discover that we can listen .
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found himself in the first start of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me , the way of stars that bring black holes , like Lig@@ o they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
they are tremendous and ancient body from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak to our archaeological work .
&quot; Lig@@ o makes us a completely different perspective on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and cat@@ er@@ pillars of the cos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ ories -- a completely new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ oria on Earth and in All .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine ?
now the time is great dreams .
dreams with us .
thanks .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say all &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it was nervous , made me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I have to be live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , that I feared , I removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fears , speech@@ es , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes , changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain Ye@@ ah that changed my life on an unexpected . it started with a question of my small ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; bi@@ b , &quot;
&quot; as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south , &quot;
&quot; bi@@ b , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me , if I could play with her when I was at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; a new life of life in my family . from there I swear to play always with them , as soon as you do , I &apos;m doing , or whi@@ ther I go , I say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , to my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has a blo@@ oming side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; bal@@ ances to play with my children delivered my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things off you wake up life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a titanium .
dream job .
I create TV . I &apos;m making television .
I do television in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for doing this 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist .
the budget for one episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes : episodes To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts , which I created myself , and not only produced , so I don &apos;t have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans for bon@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , that is why I am a titanium . &quot;
dream job .
I &apos;d like to im@@ press you with this .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a household , take me seriously when I say : I understand that there is no dream of dreams about dreams . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am deep@@ ened in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted a screen on canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream , you dream a high level of clay , running a marathon . &quot;
it feels like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechan@@ ically , stren@@ uous and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when work is well running .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s sounds like a busy road , I could travel for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people take care of when I tell them the sum@@ s , that I don &apos;t want to write the writing to me . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong . it does .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began to work with TV production when I began to work and work , build , create and cooperate , I discovered this thing , this sum@@ s , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s of action is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s are music . the sum@@ s are light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , then you cannot achieve differently than any size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not different to stri@@ ve than to stri@@ ve , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or maybe it also means a workplace .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not for the failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I want to tell you , I &apos;m a titanium , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there , the more things the more time , the more I write history , the more expectations I write . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I &apos;m the sum@@ s .
am I only that sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , exagger@@ ated , exagger@@ ated , over@@ power@@ ing . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda @-@ Land . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
you are Baby @-@ titanium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sum@@ s stopped . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine was sil@@ enced .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore . the engine was off .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same things like always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ day , performed weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , don &apos;t do anything , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect titanium .
I was a show @-@ Titan !
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do if what is doing is the work that you love , suddenly blo@@ om suddenly ? &quot;
&quot; I know some might think : &quot; h@@ ay thyself from , im@@ pose of the author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know what you do is to work you are working , you just love to be a teacher , a painter , to be a painter , if you know the sum@@ s , when you stopped the sum@@ s when the sum@@ s stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a titanium ?
&quot; when the song of my heart hears , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; gave me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way outside , late and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I want to tell no , I want to be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , they don &apos;t called me &quot; bi@@ b . &quot; &quot;
they are called no more &quot; bi@@ b . &quot;
when is that happening ?
&quot; I spend it if I &apos;m Titan and my sum@@ s , and here everything changes in my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and their sisters encounter , we laugh many and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is exceptional because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can do nothing except to adjust . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists , sticky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ist pins and the song , in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air on this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
the opposite is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come back slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s remain with the thing .
it &apos;s Love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the working environment , the titanium , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you , who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I &apos;m working with those of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is not power and it is not labor specific .
it is dependent on the joy .
the real sum@@ s depend on love .
&quot; the sum@@ s is the stream , which comes from the lust of life . &quot;
the real sum@@ s are self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history that are to do , expectation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps I whis@@ pered the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I make this fixed rule , so that I can free me as a work@@ piece of every debt . &quot;
&quot; it is a law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ mers again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing for me is not a sat@@ a , how to work . &quot;
&quot; the truth does hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at home as at home .
&quot; this agreement is painful , because what a man works rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we sha@@ ved around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we sm@@ ashed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always follow my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! let them say yes when your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll keep myself for na@@ ive , for a day dream . &quot;
&quot; well , you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play for a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they have imag@@ ined that they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and speak my teen daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am Mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
&quot; each can bring 15 minutes on a piece , even on a bad mood day ! &quot;
15 minutes on a piece !
&quot; no mobile , no laundry , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but there are 15 minutes in it !
&quot; my children are my delight , my world . there must be no children . it is to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do good .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in this . I am fail@@ ing and I won victories . friends meet , books , read the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is just for everything I &apos;ve abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on a piece why not allow it to allow for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s seems to return if I &apos;m not working .
work doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a couple of months a door open to the energy and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , she meets me and my soul . I will hide it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s isn &apos;t me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sticky fingers , dinners with friends . &quot;
that is my sum@@ s now .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum@@ s of work is part of me , but only a part . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
&quot; it is me dirty that I &apos;m a titanium . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
&quot; yes , I said Yes to less work and to play more . &quot;
and nevertheless I have everything in the hand . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good Mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the land which I run , the marathon , I run , the screens , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life : the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , durable , naked and new life in me wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things off , I am we@@ aken about life . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a bit dre@@ aming .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and to play more . &quot;
Titan@@ en hasn &apos;t have a chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks fine .
I am neuro@@ surgery .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a severe stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low ability to support self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , heavy handi@@ cap . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous ones , the &quot; &quot; deep @-@ stag @-@ stim@@ ulation &quot; . &quot; the im@@ planted electro@@ de is im@@ planted in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
&quot; Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency department .
often I used patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you must imagine that brain trau@@ mat@@ a is til@@ ted in brain trau@@ mas and incl@@ ined to the brain pressure .
&quot; to save life , you have to decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; growing cells from a tissue , is comparable to the very small children who will get out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to th@@ rive . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , it made Jean François Hollande . &quot;
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with big green cells that are surrounded by small , mature cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you may still know more of the biolog@@ ist classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can be turned into any cell type of organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are covered in deep , small niche of brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
&quot; they never die , they are immort@@ al . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so , we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our large @-@ hir@@ n@@ rin@@ da cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the stage of the fo@@ etus , they take care of the f@@ ission of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay for us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find it at higher concentrations near brain ab@@ uses . &quot;
but that is not so sure .
&quot; however , one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area , and then cultiv@@ ate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François . &quot;
&quot; and then , marking the color , to be able to pursue them in the brain . &quot;
&quot; last step , we im@@ planted it at the close meeting of the same individual . &quot;
we call this aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted the cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re@@ im@@ planted the same cells in the damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after some weeks they were collected , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario we had a violation of and re@@ im@@ planted the same cells , and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were im@@ planted .
the evidence showing them are these small points . these are the cells that are colored in vitro in the culture .
&quot; here we could not stop , of course . &quot;
can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
&quot; so , we trained monkeys with a manual skill . &quot;
you had to take feed pellets for one tray .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable level of dex@@ ter@@ ity , we injured the mot@@ orized c@@ ort@@ ex range in motor Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they get spontan@@ e@@ ously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkeys . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous re@@ spiration , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , they see the monkeys that repeated spontan@@ e@@ ously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance in front of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the irrit@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; I can tell you , that was very exciting for us . &quot;
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , they im@@ planted in men . &quot;
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how human brain is the means to heal yourself . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that there are some dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who can do it . &quot;
I definitely won .
&quot; of course , the question is what the largest barriers are , before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from this great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kind of studies .
&quot; BG : that is understand@@ able , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to be hosp@@ itali@@ zed and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the agency allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it needs a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate it , whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , one must apply this to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment . &quot;
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : of course .
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; we have a big mistake in the West , to consider them as of course . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that it is in reality , but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider it as un@@ changeable ge@@ aring .
we believe capitalism has inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy comes to us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rising friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if anything would change anything . &quot;
at this point I want to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I beg you , together with me again , believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group will believe us , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are sp@@ ared to our future and our great , new technologies are w@@ asted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject , I want to prove you to an interesting conflict that currently threat@@ ens our ta@@ vern . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . they know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who casts his long shade over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt of debt , &quot;
only few recogni@@ zable his Di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be anxi@@ ous to invest there , however , to invest there where it might be productive and could produce all the things that humanity is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment , and so on . &quot;
&quot; it sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 billion US dollars , which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time , and absolutely nothing to cast out the stock prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and non @-@ productive capital constitute the twin peaks , which does not comply with the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result will be stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the US , Japan and Europe , and therefore a low @-@ economic demand that could not invest in a low demand for those self @-@ inflammatory , that would not be aware that his son will kill him if he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances leads to that Ö@@ di@@ pus kills him . &quot;
that is my shar@@ k with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely waste capital . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed , what do we understand under democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy in form of social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the priority of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these cl@@ as@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they did not enter the working arms , but not only the right to free expression of expression , but more import@@ antly and crucial to them the right to political participation with equal mood in question of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not kept it long --
&quot; like a candle , which lights very light , it is burned too quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed on politics during the economy - so the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone was created .
&quot; since the time of today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time that the separation between politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable battle between the two , and the economy gradually immig@@ rated to politics . &quot;
&quot; wonder why the politicians are not so much , like before ? &quot;
it is not in de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is that you can be in the government nowadays , and yet not on power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separate . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of prey that feeds the animals so sustain@@ ably the animals , from which it feeds itself , that they are therefore star@@ ved at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far @-@ caused by the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , the economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of its companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism spar@@ ked the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour force and wealth of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; reserves the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Marx@@ ist Left had this idea over 100 years ago and it was not quite good .
&quot; the doctrine from the de@@ ac@@ el of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low glo@@ om workers by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation the twin peaks are higher , the waste number , and the social conflicts deeper , as it -- already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the economy and politics , and make sure that we want to recover the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a disease surveillance hy@@ auto@@ cr@@ iti@@ an that will appear to the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not if capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements , which he has produced , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that the society will serve as &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve their energy into the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks with the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
so what would it like to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ such utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; in practical implementation I would like to give you , in all brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies : please ask a capital market in which you earned money , while you are working and in which your capital is coming to you from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and income origin@@ ate and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not belong to those who work there , but the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to which the company does not hear more between investment and don@@ ors , and ultimately no significant twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ate exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; . &quot;
&quot; continue to imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and every government pays the sum to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , particularly in parts of the world , in which investment is rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes suggested in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that it was not the technical resources to implement it back then .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I have been managing , is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they have privileged persons , and Marx@@ ist , because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash@@ ore of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
become we awakening in such a world
or are we going to drop into a &quot; Matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to be politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos; analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do not work , technological development will generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand , which Larry Sum@@ mers are called &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries , whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is minimal . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , Marx is definitely relevant &quot;
&quot; like Hay@@ ek , so I am a more liberal Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : that &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you have from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy over politics during the area where most of it plays , -- the field of economy -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in certain ways , if I may say that it is pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles the 19th century England today . &quot;
&quot; -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historical . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was especially sk@@ ep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China now , resem@@ bles very much the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to second . &quot;
&quot; now to cast China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells of the hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as a Finance Minister from the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to adopt us from self @-@ fake , and that den@@ ial that a massive decline in line is threatened by the euro@@ zone , and continues to continue with the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek crisis -- by the way , the first suggest@@ ion that revealed this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the forces within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , will continue to deny den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get a economic system that is not viable , due to political will and author@@ ism , it may be delayed by some time , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future when we don &apos;t change their structure .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as a financial minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any minister , that is , after 6 months of office , particularly in such a ten@@ se situation , that he did not have a mistake , then that &apos;s a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the bank &apos;s money to find a common solution .
but this was not .
&quot; they only wanted to bring our government to the case , just because they wanted to deal with the wor@@ d@@ ations caused by the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t wanted to admit that it has been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika , who has imposed on this policy , gest@@ ure us : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ exual mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive touch of conversations , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is opposite anyone who lives and loves Europe .
my greatest fear is that the euro@@ zone is not survi@@ ves .
&quot; for if they are not survived , the released Fli@@ b forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we propose to propose the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope so you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is : thank you for having been at T@@ ED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; from Roy Price , most of them have never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is executive director at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very tough battle . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very well . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located on the turn right onto the turn . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evalu@@ ations goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation . &quot;
&quot; will be rated your show with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; the shows are shows such as &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ di@@ cted , where , after one saw a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows such as &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going to happen at this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not rely on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ go &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle winding , the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad , they are simply not am@@ using . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon makes something so special , that &apos;s why Roy Price will not risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he will hold a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows , and presents them online where they can watch them online . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon exists for free in vain , you can interv@@ ene , right ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who will take everything .
&quot; when you start the show , when you start the show , you &apos;ll catch which parts are ski@@ pped or looks back again . &quot;
collect millions of data to decide with these data to produce which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and thereby gives the answer , and this is the answer : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US transm@@ it@@ ators . &quot;
they did this show .
anyone knows the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; alpha House , &quot; but it seems that no many remind you of this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.4 is 7.4 -- that is somewhat above the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time at another company another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager of program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is always looking for this a Super show , but he also uses data for it , but it makes it different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organized a contest , he and his team saw the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows , their course which shows them etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows them , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went to a venture , and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,1 rating on this turn . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competent , data diversi@@ fied firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data , and it works fine for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
how is that ?
&quot; however , logic does somehow indicate that this should work with everything . &quot;
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for one decision to meet you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics used as a back @-@ up .
optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; the worst thing you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , then it is a sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions too , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if any one ask here in the US and for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if there is a dis@@ miss@@ al or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide if a show is good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite of many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not true that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can predi@@ ct it through data analysis of flu , bad way , - by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news copy . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these mistakes , data have become apparent in decisions of life -- at work , in case of legal , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- a territory where some very smart people are un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions on how the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples over the difference between successful choices using data and not successful choices . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you have to do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , take this problem in its individual parts , so you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put together the individual parts to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and get together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to break a problem and understand his parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts again , and then come to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is part of pieces and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , especially if the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , where@@ with otherwise they would not have been able to get together . but the decision , how to make all these parts , get together again and make a show as &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that was not available in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they always could say : &quot; we tell us the data . &quot;
it didn &apos;t lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better choices but I think things going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and in order to be forgotten , this device is rather useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the decision for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ or or no , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment . &quot;
&quot; later , I will leave it later with a technique demo . &quot;
&quot; I have now met several decisions in my life , where I should have heard in the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have any data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated than data analysis , to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the principle .
&quot; so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately it is possible to meet decisions , if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks involved . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data , but the risks involved in the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks fine .
