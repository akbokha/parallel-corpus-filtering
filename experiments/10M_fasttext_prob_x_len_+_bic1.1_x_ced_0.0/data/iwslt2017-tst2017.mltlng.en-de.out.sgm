<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard from Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which it was spectacular, that the NSA has illegal telephones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a disastrous US intelligence service, in which the CIA passed Iran literally on a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But you know who didn't really liked the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has established against Risen and called him to call his alleged springs."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he was promoted to the symbol of the government of the government, Whistleblower and to discuss journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutions, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media does not get this information, and if they can't protect the identity of the mutigen, they are reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so, when the government in Risen was ankle, he did something that many brave reporter did already do before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was living with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, though, for years that it would be essential to their fall, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and springs can hide themselves less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than failing with failures and to make statements, you could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, concerned his telephone conversation,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its lending, and even travel tips with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and risk of risk to condemn."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, it is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower at his request, but instead the judiciary condemns more than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now, you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is home to much of their work as geheim."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we set the press coverage of the game that should be protected by the first constitutional complaint because the government has always has more opportunities to pronounce all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just like the technology of the government allowed the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources even better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can take this from the moment when they contact us, rather than in the night, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which was not yet written when Risen has written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source closing system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the internet famous, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just like the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can also upload documents or send documents, as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot procure more information, and many of the information that would like to request it would not be available from pre-priori."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is but only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments develop new spy technologies throughout the world, all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is easy to ensure that not only technology professionals such as Edward Snowden do have the opportunity to place misery. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who wants to report about abuse during the supply of soldiers, and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental worker, the alarm for the contaminated water of Flint performs. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies have not only been made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3 2016 the largest data leck of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that the rich and mess] have hidden [enormous money sums in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness by a declaration.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness by a statement.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a Leck of 11 million documents built in Panama's local law firm Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will receive a impression of what customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosabag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you judge that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has written bonds in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead over a narrow friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others, which are nervous for the next release, and to the next reveal documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">"now, it sounds like the plot of an agent or John-Grisham novel."</seg>
<seg id="52">"it shes away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and Mighty are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians are discussing such secret tax havens, like secret tax havens, to hide and waste their assets -- something that we have been discussing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I imagine it always like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so, one company has one company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans now, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not so, that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by principle, after which these tax havens work, Moslem Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a look at the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples which have connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states less information needs to provide less information to start a company than to get a library ID."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed an employee of training districts to go to school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to slip especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">"it is this kind of behavior, that affects us all."</seg>
<seg id="71">"here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice."</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 Bar Association in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as an African minister, the suspect money to the US wanted to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"in fact, it really shocked us that all until a lawyer decided on our investigator how to transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all precursors. none of these attorneys took us as clients, and of course no one was given to him money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to regard this as single cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not possible to submit a single lawyer from our investigative investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it does not go to a single top politiker, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound everything very comforting, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing ever had changed; as if it will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but, as a born optimist, I see that quite a lot started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen demonstrations to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron, at the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been in central registers at national level, who really stands behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA stuck behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have entered a bill in both parliaments, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure more transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">"for us at Global Witness, this is a moment for changes."</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who can furious, if they see how other people can hide their true identity behind illustrians."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need executives in the business that rise up and say: "intransparency is not good for business.</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who realize the problem, and use them to complete this type of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the intransparency, which now allows this type of tax fraud, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I had abducted almost and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I completed my design studies, I made a rear sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">One guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really plans this. I don't want to land away in the trunk of an Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small car boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought," Oh man! what did I get broken down? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of wild sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of the bed, to the door to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he wasn't mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me, depends on his classroom today. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my eye angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps people who were sold in childhood as strangers were, actually friends who were waiting for being found only on it?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to lodge in my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost plet, my roommates will be raised and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it easier to transform in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new fellow-mates Brian Chesky:" Brian, I missed something like this. our apartment will stay with a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, with a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a site and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep on a wooden floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they thought it super, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to decorate our cheese ham omelettes completely differently because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest at the castle, Brian and I fell to the castle."</seg>
<seg id="134">"we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time, and we could pay for our rent?"</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to investors:" we would like to create a website, on the people publicly accessible pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of rooms, whose doors are closes when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">"that will be the next big thing!"</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still at consolation, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned all that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, one can spy on the things that is good. we could designate them."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immenant trust between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such things?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create with design trust?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I want to give you a cost sample, which degree trust we stripped."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you from your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I want to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked mobile phone on your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet start of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">For the only thing that is still personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of you feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So the most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"only so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you tell us, on Twitter, to announce that he is the President of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">They can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had to be presented with his name only once, where he would have told how his dog or his children be called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 assessments which are saying: "he can really hold a very well locked cell phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then feel when you would have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-kept feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were given to their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we studied with Stanford a study. we examined how likely that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust the people most who are similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preference.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting if you add the call of a person -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation among the commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"thus, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deep roots."</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we knew that trust is dependent on how much you are reasonably priced."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here are the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you say too little, for example" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"as for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is rather not accepted too."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" Tolle artwork in your home! I do with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design? make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips to what topics you should write anything.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our entire company is based on hope, that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we were not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay this prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="195">"here, you see how many people take our offer."</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that was not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is very good for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything runs smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who celebrated unallowed parties and have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. so hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of Anrufer, and will always be our biggest motivation to improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of 123 had only once had a fraction of 123 million."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence works, can be created."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host came into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend due to sitting activities in heart attacks."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian that save one's life even though they don't know it right.</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive a hospital in the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to get lonely, they bring books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra charge.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"that is, of course, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's going to have a business trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but just to name" rental industry, "the thing is not just right."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">Humans place a part of itself and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"it is efficient and reliable, but it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would be, however, if travel would be a rich buffet from local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place, the one we visited, a group there would wait to fill a thoroughly and one at a pub-block district, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook a 5-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like apartments of reason for sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have to receive the thought of common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine the cities which allow us society and relations, instead of loneliness and irritation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces found in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now residents were offered now. students who were looking for a stay, were offered"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were conveyed in people whose children were gone out. Incubator programmes were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. via our platform alone, 785 000 people will be participating in 191 countries by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why didn't we work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the existing components."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about that when a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if we could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you view me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a terrorist act, a terrorist act?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the airport at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media represent the media which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study showed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans mean that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">People do not speak with their carber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met Muslims, it's great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee holders -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A sealant fitness fanatics;</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided that.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as the Muslim. I decided to bear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Luchow was: it was for me a feminist declaration of independence, and against the pressure I felt as 17-year-old felt to fit me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have a Koran with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, set in question, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that profoundly deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone makes you perceiving you complete, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the fundamentally the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, looked at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking News. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people spread out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:..." Muslim terrorists... ","... "in the name of Islam..." "..." "jihad..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the deeds of others from one citizen in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and start with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I was silent -- as we were silent -- so low it went into my seat, and I was afraid for the first time to be recognized as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved in this night into our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" be careful, "" be careful, "" Stay in well lit areas, "" Keep you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims were gathered to prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"again, warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandable, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were fighting for Muslims, into the free and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was brances in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this land, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I swept the rage of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we actually hear people say:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want Muslims contaminate and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They talk about my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">The question arises: are we malignant or good?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is located as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all the Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but an important organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, sacs and Olympioners."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">Perhaps there will be a few parking spaces but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visit to a mosque leads to people other faith tolerant, and show more civic participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, it has found that it begins online. as the first the person is cut off from their community, that the person believes that the terrorist group has abhorred the true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"after all, a group of the IS was justified with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a man, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add ourselves to their presides if they recognise it as a representative of 1.6 billion.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you throw a look at them, they do not drive out what they are in" "Holy Scripture." "</seg>
<seg id="345">"it is its brutality, which they can read these things into the Scriptures."</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because they were curtain to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. any spiritual, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence and said to her that their anger, her mind to unrighteousness in the world, would only bring it into difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumental alization by extremists who spoke one solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real shift in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight into the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies show -- show: if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather a authorized government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if you report test persons news in which negative about Muslims were reported, they have more military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the lead-up of the war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in fact, it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to exert the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear does not harm us."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain itself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was in the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, most generous person he knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her CV. she was blended and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did my young man become such a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne's brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, was murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting the afternoon in the afternoon. he did in her home, as opposed to Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He dropped eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanatism can not only be moral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we gone to the mosque or we stayed home safely?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not easy decision, because that America we would like to leave our children: one that we may control us through fear, or one where we can practise our religion free."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, and my shoes went out, went into the building hall, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement to thank and welcomed our guests, because half of the meeting were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to join us but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at this moment, I am broken together."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panicked and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or are you connected to those who think: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what do you think about those who think you have a TEDTalk, a thought with deep dive to work in a nook thinking factory, so an exception and not the rule are."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't be fooled. I am completely normal."</seg>

<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">"looking at the Muslims all over the world, and I did that with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims in the whole world, people want normal things."</seg>
<seg id="403">"they want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace."</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>

<seg id="407">"what began as a platform for Basters, is about to become a billionshop."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for professional drones. it is possible in research institutions around the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air packages start into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France live a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago she began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flying panels reach high speed and acceleration on the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"you have learned to deal with burdens, with turbulence and react in general public laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we want to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to create a system autonomous, it needs to be collectively knowing where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"we use a new location technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each air machine has internal sensors to determine position in the room, computations on board, what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level. for example," "start" and landing. ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight machine, which tries to beat two flies with a flap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the downward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can hover, and so great benefits in start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a flip side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailor is that they react sensitively to turbulence as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is, that the airmachine doesn't matter which the optimum position can be obtained, and the achievement can be improved."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often present basic abstract issues that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be for example: what is the smallest possible number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to answer the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about machines with a thousand motioned parts that were joined together to violate you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"ago, a trained pilot controlled flight equipment could fly, which had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear wheel."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remotely used flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although mechanics is simple, happening in the indoor life very much, so it can fly stable, and can move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithms of the stern. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly if I see all, is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospinner is a exercise in enjoyment, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is equivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the great skill skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is shot or even like he rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the interactive rivers of the eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is possible in models, the rest is learned directly with flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns on clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the others counterclockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds it together, they behave like a high-performance quadrucopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine further when it is restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by being able to do a half.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was synonymous with synthetic shades.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we took commercial micro-quadruter -- each single weighs less than a slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where space is, and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine as it wants to become a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us there is a reward in the development and the pact.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, wise tastes to form it in so spectacular manner."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the dot on the i.</seg>

<seg id="469">"more than 1.3 billion years ago in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are getting faster and faster, you turned the mass of three sones in a tenth of pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for those short moment, they lightened more brighter than all stars in all galaxies of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big Knall.</seg>
<seg id="472">"their energy, however, set it not in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-feeling itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"about 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell living on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God stand for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"25 years ago, a group was decided to build a group especially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Dreger from the Caltech -- a huge laser detector to look for gravitational waves, which arise about black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them kept crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as mad geniuses that the U.S. National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of anger, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser-interferometriometrial observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"during the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could significantly improved what improved performance was enormous."</seg>
<seg id="483">So let's call it Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the commissioning of the detector, gravitational waves of the two collidiating black holes passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">"they went through you, and me"</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: just two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my suffering is father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I worked for what I worked is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been investigating gravitational waves like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves? "</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is an exhausting in the emotions of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when crossing the shaft, the space and its entire content will expand into one direction and striped into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturers in courses for relativity was often a really albery dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"for example, on 14 September, for example, each of us stretched out the waves and striped off. the strain of an average people was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. this reason one explained the Ligo staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, which is already absurd, this length would be accurate to less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear bomb. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic textile about Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, the hunt for the waves like this:" the technical difficulties when constructing such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"physicists are financially and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo is more one ear than one eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite convenient, because you can produce a picture or map of things by taking the light around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wave length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that make you a lot of:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About the face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we lurred for certain characteristics such as pitch and level, rhythm and volume, to close the history behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"right now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob suppress them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"number Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can't make any easy pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by contrast to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can hear their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern in shots, we can hear the all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circultion simply: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turning the two bodies very fast, one stops the same circled with an additional pitch of sound. that sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu:"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement of movement, shaped into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I never forget -- heard Ligo the following: [Surrender of the sound] Jn, who knows what he must hear, recognizes this as sound from -- SH:... two black holes with each 30 times the mass of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we are thinking about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve a hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine this force.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore Alls as they never before was possible.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the All and the Invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Many in all we can see -- practical or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massaging stars explode in supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur, but in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see as these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves penetrate iron, as if it is transparent glass. I'd like to search for the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, because the urine is veiled through its own refgings."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I'm optimistic that in all things we've never seen we will never see and of which we don't have any idea that we can only discover that we can listen.</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found himself in the first start of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me, the way of stars that bring black holes, like Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are tremendous and ancient body from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak to our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo makes us a completely different perspective on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and caterpillars of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a completely new generation of Observatoria on Earth and in All.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than to listen to the urine?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dreams with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say all" Yes! "I was afraid of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it was nervous, made me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say" Yes "." "</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Would I have to be live on television?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, that I feared, I removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fears, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes, my life changed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes, changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain Yeah that changed my life on an unexpected. it started with a question of my small ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all" bib, "</seg>
<seg id="570">"as if they were a waitress from the south,"</seg>
<seg id="571">"bib, I need milk for my beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me, if I could play with her when I was at the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life of life in my family. from there I swear to play always with them, as soon as you do, I'm doing, or whither I go, I say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, to my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has a blooming side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" balances to play with my children delivered my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things off you wake up life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create TV. I'm making television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I do television in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for doing this 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that previously did not exist.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one episode of a television channel can lie between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars TV, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes: episodes To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of those 70 TV hours are broadcasts, which I created myself, and not only produced, so I don't have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans for bonfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that is why I am a titanium."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I'd like to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so all of you who work so hard if you're now a company, a country or a household, take me seriously when I say: I understand that there is no dream of dreams about dreams."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am deepened in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I painted a screen on canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dream, you dream a high level of clay, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">It feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanically, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when work is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums sounds like a busy road, I could travel for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take care of when I tell them the sums, that I don't want to write the writing to me."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong. it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work with TV production when I began to work and work, build, create and cooperate, I discovered this thing, this sums, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums of action is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, then you cannot achieve differently than any size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not different to strive than to strive, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workplace.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not for the failure, and I know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I want to tell you, I'm a titanium, and I know I don't want to ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there, the more things the more time, the more I write history, the more expectations I write."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I'm the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, exaggerated, exaggerated, overpowering."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are Baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silenced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things like always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-day, performed weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, don't do anything, with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect titanium.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan!</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do if what is doing is the work that you love, suddenly bloom suddenly?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some might think:" hay thyself from, impose of the author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know what you do is to work you are working, you just love to be a teacher, a painter, to be a painter, if you know the sums, when you stopped the sums when the sums stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a titanium?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart hears, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" gave me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way outside, late and she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I want to tell no, I want to be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, they don't called me" bib. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They are called no more "bib."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I spend it if I'm Titan and my sums, and here everything changes in my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. "</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters encounter, we laugh many and I read very dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is exceptional because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sums, I can do nothing except to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists, sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, waist pins and the song, in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" Die Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air on this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">The opposite is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, hardly audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's remain with the thing.</seg>
<seg id="702">It's Love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working environment, the titanium, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you, who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I'm working with those of broadcasts and TV hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is not power and it is not labor specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the stream, which comes from the lust of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history that are to do, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps I whispered the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a titanium?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I make this fixed rule, so that I can free me as a workpiece of every debt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is a law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the summers again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing for me is not a sata, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth does hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at home as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this agreement is painful, because what a man works rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shaved around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We smashed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always follow my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! let them say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you'll keep myself for naive, for a day dream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"well, you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play for a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they have imagined that they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teen daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am Mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring 15 minutes on a piece, even on a bad mood day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But there are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my delight, my world. there must be no children. it is to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in this. I am failing and I won victories. friends meet, books, read the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "is just for everything I've abandoned when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece why not allow it to allow for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seems to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a couple of months a door open to the energy and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, she meets me and my soul. I will hide it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I'm not the sums, the sums isn't me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinners with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my sums now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but only a part. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me dirty that I'm a titanium. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">"yes, I said Yes to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="780">And nevertheless I have everything in the hand. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good Mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land which I run, the marathon, I run, the screens, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life: the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, durable, naked and new life in me wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things off, I am weaken about life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"it belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a bit dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and to play more."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen hasn't have a chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks fine.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a severe stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low ability to support self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, heavy handicap."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous ones, the" "deep-stag-stimulation". "the implanted electrode is implanted in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"Neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency department.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I used patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You must imagine that brain traumata is tilted in brain traumas and inclined to the brain pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"growing cells from a tissue, is comparable to the very small children who will get out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, it made Jean François Hollande."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw it under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with big green cells that are surrounded by small, mature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you may still know more of the biologist classes that stem cells are unripe cells, which can be turned into any cell type of organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are covered in deep, small niche of brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface fabric of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They were divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so, we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our large-hirnrinda cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the stage of the foetus, they take care of the fission of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find it at higher concentrations near brain abuses."</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"however, one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François."</seg>
<seg id="853">"and then, marking the color, to be able to pursue them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">"last step, we implanted it at the close meeting of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call this autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted the cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in the damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after some weeks they were collected, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario we had a violation of and reimplanted the same cells, and now the cells remained -- it grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence showing them are these small points. these are the cells that are colored in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">"here we could not stop, of course."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we trained monkeys with a manual skill."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets for one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the motorized cortex range in motor Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they get spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous respiration, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side, they see the monkeys that repeated spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its original performance in front of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the irritation."</seg>
<seg id="877">"I can tell you, that was very exciting for us."</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, they implanted in men."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how human brain is the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that there are some dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know somebody who can do it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely won.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the largest barriers are, before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from this great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass these kind of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: that is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to be hospitalized and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the agency allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it needs a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate it, whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"afterwards, one must apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you have to reprove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment."</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us."</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"we have a big mistake in the West, to consider them as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchangeable gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism has inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have demonstrated that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes to us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- not affect the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rising friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if anything would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I want to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me again, believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup will believe us, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are spared to our future and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject, I want to prove you to an interesting conflict that currently threatens our tavern."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. they know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who casts his long shade over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">Only few recognizable his Didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be anxious to invest there, however, to invest there where it might be productive and could produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the United States, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"it sounds a lot of money until you compare it with the 5.1 billion US dollars, which were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions around the same time, and absolutely nothing to cast out the stock prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and non-productive capital constitute the twin peaks, which does not comply with the usual market mechanisms by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result will be stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the US, Japan and Europe, and therefore a low-economic demand that could not invest in a low demand for those self-inflammatory, that would not be aware that his son will kill him if he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances leads to that Ödipus kills him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my shark with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely waste capital. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies" green "technologies that are crucial for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed, what do we understand under democracy? "</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy in form of social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the priority of Athenian democracy due to these clasps."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that they did not enter the working arms, but not only the right to free expression of expression, but more importantly and crucial to them the right to political participation with equal mood in question of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not kept it long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which lights very light, it is burned too quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">The liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and economy is possible and the democratic process was imposed on politics during the economy - so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone was created.</seg>
<seg id="941">"since the time of today's democracies, since the time that the separation between politics and economy began, an inexorable battle between the two, and the economy gradually immigrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">"wonder why the politicians are not so much, like before?"</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is that you can be in the government nowadays, and yet not on power because the power of politics into the economy is separated and the areas are separate."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's about like a herd of prey that feeds the animals so sustainably the animals, from which it feeds itself, that they are therefore starved at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far-caused by the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, the economic demand falls and the general manager of the corporations are anxious to invest the cash of its companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism sparked the" demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour force and wealth of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the policy and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "reserves the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea over 100 years ago and it was not quite good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the deacel of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms can only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low gloom workers by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation the twin peaks are higher, the waste number, and the social conflicts deeper, as it -- already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reconstruct the economy and reunite the economy and politics, and make sure that we want to recover the reunited area, otherwise we end in a disease surveillance hyautocritian that will appear to the movie" Matrix "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not if capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements, which he has produced, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix, "or something that the society will serve as" "Star Trek", "in which machines serve their energy into the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian" Agora, "in long talks with the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it like to look like this "Star Trek" -such utopia instead of the "Matrix" -similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation I would like to give you, in all brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies: please ask a capital market in which you earned money, while you are working and in which your capital is coming to you from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and income originate and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not belong to those who work there, but the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to which the company does not hear more between investment and donors, and ultimately no significant twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please just imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuate exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries]."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos "," units of "Cosmos", "in units of" Kosmos "" -- and every government pays the sum to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invested in" green "technologies, particularly in parts of the world, in which investment is rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes suggested in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that it was not the technical resources to implement it back then.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in the background a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I have been managing, is at the same time liberally, in which they have privileged persons, and Marxist, because they have buried the separation of capital and work in the trashore of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Become we awakening in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or are we going to drop into a "Matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to be politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx 'analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do not work, technological development will generate a massive decline in the overall economic demand, which Larry Summers are called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis from a part of the earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries, whose interest in liberally democracy is minimal."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, Marx is definitely relevant"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, so I am a more liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: that's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly said what you have from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy over politics during the area where most of it plays, -- the field of economy -- a completely democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in certain ways, if I may say that it is provocative, China resembles the 19th century England today."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historical."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was especially skeptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China now, resembles very much the development which we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now to cast China now, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of the hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as a Finance Minister from the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to adopt us from self-fake, and that denial that a massive decline in line is threatened by the eurozone, and continues to continue with the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek crisis -- by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the forces within the eurozone, within the European group, will continue to deny denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get a economic system that is not viable, due to political will and authorism, it may be delayed by some time, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future when we don't change their structure.</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any minister, that is, after 6 months of office, particularly in such a tense situation, that he did not have a mistake, then that's a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the bank's money to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But this was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to bring our government to the case, just because they wanted to deal with the wordations caused by the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't wanted to admit that it has been a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika, who has imposed on this policy, gesture us:" that was a colosexual mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive touch of conversations, you seem to be quite a pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is opposite anyone who lives and loves Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the eurozone is not survives.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they are not survived, the released Flib forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price, most of them have never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision which Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is executive director at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very tough battle."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very well."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located on the turn right onto the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluations goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will receive this evaluation."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"will be rated your show with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"the shows are shows such as" Breaking Bad "," Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicted, where, after one saw a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows such as" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going to happen at this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not rely on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undergo" Toddlers and tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle winding, the average television -- the shows that neither good nor bad, they are simply not amusing."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon makes something so special, that's why Roy Price will not risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he will hold a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and elects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows, and presents them online where they can watch them online."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon exists for free in vain, you can intervene, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched by watching this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who will take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"when you start the show, when you start the show, you'll catch which parts are skipped or looks back again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">Collect millions of data to decide with these data to produce which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and thereby gives the answer, and this is the answer:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US transmitators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Anyone knows the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," alpha House, "but it seems that no many remind you of this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of these curve 7.4 is 7.4 -- that is somewhat above the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time at another company another manager has plazed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager of program design of Netflix. just like Roy is always looking for this a Super show, but he also uses data for it, but it makes it different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organized a contest, he and his team saw the existing data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows, their course which shows them etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows them, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went to a venture, and decided not to make a Sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this turn. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competent, data diversified firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data, and it works fine for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">How is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">"however, logic does somehow indicate that this should work with everything."</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for one decision to meet you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics used as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the worst thing you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, then it is a scary because we live in a time in which we take more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions too, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if any one ask here in the US and for dismissal, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine if there is a dismissal or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide if a show is good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, it can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite of many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not true that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can predict it through data analysis of flu, bad way, - by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news copy. the success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the journal" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these mistakes, data have become apparent in decisions of life -- at work, in case of legal, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- a territory where some very smart people are unimaginable many data to make serious decisions on how the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples over the difference between successful choices using data and not successful choices. this pattern should be disseminated.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you have to do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, take this problem in its individual parts, so you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put together the individual parts to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and get together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to break a problem and understand his parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to assemble the parts again, and then come to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is part of pieces and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, especially if the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, wherewith otherwise they would not have been able to get together. but the decision, how to make all these parts, get together again and make a show as" House of Cards "," that was not available in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they always could say: "we tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It didn't lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better choices but I think things going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and in order to be forgotten, this device is rather useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the decision for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it's amazing. for decisions using a jor or no, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." highly likely "-- exactly here in this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"later, I will leave it later with a technique demo."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have now met several decisions in my life, where I should have heard in the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have any data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated than data analysis, to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the principle.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so maybe the ball is smarter and smarter. ultimately it is possible to meet decisions, if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the great amount of data still pays out to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks involved."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data, but the risks involved in the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks fine.</seg>
