&quot; Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your eyes to the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ age where young people are to meet .
&quot; a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle , where is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ dener generate the current reason for farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories on days .
it is nervous when playing cards are not currently present .
everyone knows that had to be exciting for the car because the car @-@ Nav@@ i had a green meadow .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are all others more than currently - but therefore very reve@@ aling . &quot;
especially if you compare it with current online cards .
&quot; then , the cities and municipalities in the area of Munich has changed since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ ich that is not the same as such .
&quot; in the large over@@ sight card , tickets for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps , so @-@ called urine leaves . &quot;
&quot; these originated after the Bavarian survey@@ ing administration between 1810 and 1864 , and jump on the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns . &quot;
your Client : Napoleon .
&quot; in the spring of 1800 , the French armies occupied since spring 1800 during the second coalition of war with Austria . &quot;
&quot; in Napoleon , Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic photo of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes . &quot;
&quot; finally , when the French troops seized the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 , it was today &apos;s neighbors , which created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thereby the Bavarian State Administration . &quot;
&quot; the jungle sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is , like all others , on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the country &apos;s capital .
the city expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is sub@@ du@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , in the Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling lies in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of sub@@ sid@@ ers are concentrated in 1856 along today &apos;s pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is , there is nothing more than fields - at first glance : when in zo@@ oming , a small @-@ piece card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written bottle pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ als &quot; from which the fundamental tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; there are no farmers in the countryside today , but small gar@@ dener in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , in the 19th century , had actually a meadow , and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle table one reads only the street name &quot; &quot; Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , not only the street names &quot; &quot; at the inn &quot; &quot; or at the bottom &quot; &quot; At the ventilation &quot; - but also in great letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here , at the Au@@ er@@ field road , people once un@@ locked people with mad@@ ness . &quot;
in 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &apos; was created on the Au@@ er ventilation .
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ der directed the establishment of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the an@@ chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , director of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients , first place was first , and it was extended to 500 places later . &quot;
at some time this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ r@@ ament in hair in 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist in Germany . &quot;
young people meet young people at the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt .
&quot; the Order received the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth home with education . &quot;
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; built in architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 1856 as the &quot; main place &quot; and the department of merchants called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city centre .
one big remained until today - by Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , Small Business Houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once more to the Mari@@ enhof , where this day will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der sli@@ der , the old Munich map will be compared with the air image of today - and fill the hole on Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group Publ@@ ished travel warning for Missouri
the National Union to promote Far@@ ms has issued a warning for colored people who are based on the discri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Missouri .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri , which should come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a number of frag@@ fying , racial @-@ based accidents in recent times in the entire state , and here is to be noted here . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people heavier to gain discrimination against discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , aimed to release the dis@@ sent@@ ing group , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , the people pass . &quot;
&quot; due to their skin color , they are beaten and killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such an incidence which we have not heard .
it is the first such warning to exhibit the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited inci@@ dents as rac@@ ist fighting against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ ing circumstances in the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state of Missouri in custody , without being accused of crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also refers to a recently published report of the Office of the Office of Missouri , in which black motor@@ ists will be able to keep 75 percent more common in the state . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families , friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said chapel . &quot;
people must be willing to bring it on the money or relatives that they travel through the state .
&quot; Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in the year 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the FBI &apos;s report program , which had the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for home or employment discrimination .
&quot; earlier , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona , after the United States have passed immigration authorities to susp@@ end people because of immigration disorders , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; it@@ war@@ nings are normally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries , but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the fence project is elementary .
the Fis@@ her@@ acher Wei@@ dez@@ aun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CDU Bundest@@ ag@@ s@@ led Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac were given a picture on the spot .
the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family members met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs in the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted first insights into its operation , in which it supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as well as many young cattle and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; is responsible for him the ageing process of the milk of its cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the cottages are exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ President of Fis@@ her@@ ald , he described the &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; as &quot; elem@@ ental project . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t accum@@ ulate on der@@ art steep faces .
&quot; the green surface care for much work , much must be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann stressed . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh operation and worked on this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not have a bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , the Commun@@ e was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the funding promotion . &quot;
&quot; at costs between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope , that the point of view of the surfaces could go out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , the people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they continue their operation , &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often seen in criticism
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the reve@@ aling surface amounts to 40 hectares , which must not be applied until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; half of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter carried out the Fis@@ cal community . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers were donated to 12 610 euros , that they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometers of the fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; explained Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and fellow women do not go . &quot;
also available for Peter White : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the state of coun@@ cils ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg is possible to support the state funding of Wei@@ de@@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded funding .
&quot; in addition , the fence can not be har@@ med by the fence . ( hang@@ ar above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the arm@@ or . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ cal Com@@ ming Project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which are located just under 16 kilometers of fence . &quot;
&quot; the covering space corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated cost of more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty now .
&quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , if they begin to attack the statues . &quot;
&quot; the Americans appreciate these as every other , so the sor@@ bet of Saddam Hussein staged on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , didn &apos;t know what he did when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CNN about the proposals for the dra@@ stic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller won &apos;t handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have wished to do it if he had done it .
&quot; but it touches its importance , and especially the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument . &quot;
&quot; when Miller A@@ co@@ sta passed : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty ... an icon of American freedom which light@@ ens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer later , was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is correct , but how he form@@ ulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary reson@@ ance on the elabor@@ ate words of Lazarus , the only one where a state did not only invite any old immigrants , but the arms of the poor : &quot; your pot@@ ters , your poor , and yours in@@ pressing masses that year@@ ns to breathe freely , the el@@ ent waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ating tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller does not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural argument : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words after her death on the base - did not know that it has been made a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans in creating a classical picture showing the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she herself is a different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the association with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed , people wanted to change them from the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the great scre@@ am Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the bapt@@ ist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was that the American flame is going into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch shall not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States . &quot;
rather unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the view@@ point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys at the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and improve a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; her statue speaks to them the words of hope , and of welcome you must hear . &quot;
and that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever wish to recognise .
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black is the Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle reminds himself of a time when only two vill@@ us belonged to the UK team .
&quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of world championship lead &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 on Friday .
black believes that &quot; something special has developed in Scotland &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand , and we will continue , until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the guy from the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ cher - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is rather modest .
&quot; her chapter speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or practice , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; passion and real feeling , the emot@@ ion of natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth @-@ Silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships for the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that &quot; &quot; unbelievable &quot; &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last year , the middle distances of Mu@@ ir leads five British and two European records last year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle reminds himself of their first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud &quot; on the fact that many of their fellow country@@ men are not only the team , but in some cases also at the medals and for the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about team cap@@ tains is in the fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me , makes it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to Po@@ wers . &quot;
what is my speech as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think they went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it &apos;s really important to set on this home support and benefit that we are again in the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and there &apos;s just a great atmosphere there out there . &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not apply to a public office if you cannot bear the heating of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspaper struck him because of everything , from the inner policy up to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he was im@@ min@@ ed with criticism , safe . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put his critics into silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dum@@ b , and m@@ ute , as sheep for the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; after Maryland Jo@@ og@@ an , this brings me to Maryland Jo@@ og@@ an who needs to work more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people , and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained him about this week in the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Govern@@ ors of the Governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online comment was filled with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when there is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor , in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary heat head .
it has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
&quot; he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters , and to use his ha@@ em@@ less head to chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , blocking of people who come on the page of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum , which is considered officially called and by employees who are paid by public tax @-@ Dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
in an interview with The Washington Post joined H@@ og@@ an &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ amm@@ ers , which sw@@ aying online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the Post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and they are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no trol@@ ls . &quot;
&quot; they said they said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an &apos;s Catholic faith . &quot;
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ fully , but she asked for Hass@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; I commented on pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary section of the news release &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people became the same subject , they are used by some more than a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated Spam attack &quot; would call other likely &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut out , simply by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous times , when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and to burn or kill protest@@ ers and to silence . &quot;
but this is just happening digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials saying that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is pro@@ claim by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , last the First Am@@ end@@ ment , published according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , proclaimed a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable Por@@ tos had similar effects like the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters struck down on his leadership . &quot;
&quot; and even at that time , Washington had anony@@ me . &quot;
&quot; people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola &quot; , &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers , which make Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ ition@@ ing that crit@@ ically critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put it into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreements , and dis@@ courses are the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true guiding means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hoping for domestic comfort in Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European Union no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hope in the next three days of domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lor@@ hi@@ an organiz@@ es the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the En@@ dr@@ unde last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue as a tournament holder in the name of the founding @-@ founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he put this place .
he is an eag@@ erly advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he has won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it had won them in the year after I was taken out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the home scene . &quot;
this event will be the first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it good , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
&quot; I really enjoyed playing again , and I played a solid golf . &quot;
I am glad about how it went so far .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Champion Paul Broad@@ ho@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ eile . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six stops on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) will come to this result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he moved to this subject to this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; reas@@ onably then in time , &quot; says the head of the court of Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house closures , the situation is more complicated than susp@@ ects , as the underground contains a lot of amounts , which is not listed in the plans . &quot;
the traffic that has always imp@@ aired the construction work is a major problem for the construction in the St@@ ump@@ p company .
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indonesian gold land
if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner you don &apos;t use any stove .
it even uses only rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ an@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the stolen Kn@@ olle is taken from eag@@ erly , washed hands and swallowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she runs their daily work , for example clothes with cloudy water from the nearby S@@ mur@@ f . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
the youngest of the four wives of her husband were not allocated to their fields .
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be quite dangerous : the most vill@@ men are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one doesn &apos;t dare , at 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life of the Hochland von Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1.0@@ 26 elders should vote before the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal representatives . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and west , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea to the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo shel@@ ters , and made of wave boards which were converted into various yellow tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indonesian have made their journey here , refuse to journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her lively , hand woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; previously , we had only leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesian gold .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine of the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ lands of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort destroyed the value of 3.1 billion US dollars of gold and copper alone . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua wood resources has a value of estimated $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these wealth are a source of affliction for the Papua , which ensure that Indonesian military preser@@ ves a former military presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local military forces and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for larger autonomy thre@@ aten these golden gin and are mer@@ cil@@ essly treated .
&quot; according to the activists of activists more than 500,000 Americans have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped by the Indonesian military since 1969 , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970 @-@ s mass kill@@ ings in the 1970 @-@ s , mass kill@@ ings were committed to the genocide of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators in the region . &quot;
&quot; we Are All Ver@@ sions &quot; is in a report by the arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about atro@@ cities committed in the year 2016 , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have strengthened themselves , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development changes , as Muslim economic migration from the populated islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ fare is selling fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people fight around here .
&quot; the migrants have begun , chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua to sell , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 year old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local , who moved to the province Capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the indigenous Papua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua and its market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised during his election campaign in 2014 , the ine@@ qualities and the legal rights violations in Papua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann is 27 out of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a depth of only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ l &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot;
&quot; the rock@@ ing children said to them , they should turn off their head@@ lights . &quot;
&quot; one of the soldiers participated in their tone , and later came back by four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued and beat the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , said sacrifices and witnesses . &quot;
&quot; then , one of the soldiers fired in the group of children . &quot;
&quot; a child , the 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to hit that he fell into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and the things are escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered to a football field before the local police station and the military commander to demand justice . &quot;
they carried the tro@@ op hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some protest@@ ers started stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent to a command of an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released to local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned back , I suddenly shot in my left hand , he said to the porch of his colorful wood @-@ house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the rows of here assembled . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was met three times , so his cousin , the witness of expul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who , as many Indonesian , bears only one name , the TIM@@ E said in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the head @-@ inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their station only &quot; &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the messages about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i was in Jay@@ ap@@ ura in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he vo@@ wed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ or to go to the historical problems in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Policy Wir@@ anto announced that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the fail@@ ures began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred before long time .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ he years .
&quot; the point is that we have obliged to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat , when he spoke to Jak@@ arta in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E and said that he had no plans in Papua a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally regulated , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was accused of having been accused of crimes against humanity by the UN for crimes against humanity by the UN , which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor &apos;s independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Vor@@ um . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such claims with indig@@ nation .
&quot; I interviewed four times in the last three years but there was no progress , &quot; Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me after me , &quot; says he . &quot;
the shooting eries have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a conscious man in the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ va , who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
att@@ ested vill@@ agers prot@@ ested to the company &apos;s location .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers , who re@@ acted on it by blocking warning shots . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness as the last here has been delivered quickly , so the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house , &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called to withdraw the officers to raise the officers and withdraw the police Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an infinite herd for the Indonesian government .
&quot; lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family @-@ related Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al , who live in green land of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claims to defend the rights of Papua troops , def@@ ending spor@@ adic attacks and demonstrations of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ das Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in response , thousands of people arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some emerge again .
among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic and forgotten place .
poverty strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just outside range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
&quot; they keep the most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold in the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic im@@ balance between the local Papua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight gro@@ oves to the Nab@@ al airport in larger numbers . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot;
Papua rarely the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in to stay in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Princip@@ al of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , limitations of the reporting international media remain ten@@ sion@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to films . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign to raise the limitations of reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West paper@@ ua : visa extension and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March they called for six Pacific countries - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ots and the Jord@@ on Islands , to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shooting . &quot;
the same countries have seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on site want to know more foreign governments .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the right @-@ right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and th@@ ron@@ ged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; but , according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but anonymous to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the fact that they probably won &apos;t agree again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Princip@@ al Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that , is living under the constant threat of a Muslim military . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , her voice to Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want righteousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ ars led a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they may know that they may never forget justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the responsible crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with his head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest homes in Dubai in Dubai , by hundreds of residents , from the 337 m high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in just two years by the high house , which is called the tor@@ ch @-@ tower ( tor@@ ch Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the cry of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor down to the bottom , &quot; &quot; a inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais Civil Protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00@@ .00 p.m ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was frozen .
&quot; the government said , working on the provision of accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for security of materials , which are used in outer areas of high @-@ buildings around the world , revi@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; an investigation conducted by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage from the covering , outside cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of the plates are used for isolation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire in June , about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ Five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is due to its large Davis Cup coup d at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single was only supported on two winning items , as well as the two @-@ third majority supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the very long , however , very long , but also very estimated five @-@ movement classi@@ cs remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for the reform , the goal of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ c@@ ely missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; you will continue to work , to improve the competitors . &quot;
&quot; not until the vote was , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal has come to place the final on a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the right next year in the next round .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places , etc. are reli@@ eved and players will need to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers offer prohibited items in the plane , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying objects revealed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously are consci@@ ously challenged or un@@ consci@@ ously banned objects on the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , which carried out the plane while acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had been delayed , that they have travelled ir@@ r@@ t@@ orial with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted by more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather dis@@ regard the rules . &quot;
&quot; of those questioned they gave that they have attempted to fly with something that were banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were driven by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave it to have worn objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male surveyed have confirmed that they were intenti@@ onally prohibited drugs in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said it was about travelers in the whole country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had s@@ mu@@ g@@ ate s@@ mu@@ g@@ ware , and how many would have been deliberately done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who wear on the most s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , in@@ accurate or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - through safety , those who are most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
&quot; humans are often uns@@ afe , which may bring them to them , or how much of it . &quot;
&quot; so , no surprise is that the biggest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items are prohibited . &quot;
&quot; for a time , people thought T@@ SA could view books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients will cancel Order
electro @-@ thou@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k gives the huge number of orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the customer has already re@@ tra@@ cted its un@@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; besides the usual numbers of revenue increases and even more gigantic targets for sales increases Tesla @-@ boss El@@ on Mus@@ k , for the first time , has betra@@ yed a different , less gl@@ anz@@ ous figure : the cancellation fee for the new mass market Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k had frequently advert@@ ised with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k has been : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have already been withdrawn from 6@@ 3.000 . &quot;
&quot; critics have always pointed out , that it only deals with no binding reservations . &quot;
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla pays off the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; booking payment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are at present at present , in a telephone conference at the analysts at an analysts &apos; conference . &quot;
&quot; so that the cancellation of so far is about twelve percent of all orders to be encountered , the Tesla boss did not believe . &quot;
his argument : the challenge of the ambitious growth target is not in demand but on the production site .
&quot; last year , Tesla was delivered up to Tesla 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are supposed to be combined - 500,000 will be one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1,800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; if you have ordered a &quot; model 3 &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 , if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never in the practice tested production roads without any greater interru@@ ptions with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to greater del@@ ays , then the reason for Tesla could become a problem for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then , since then , the company cannot harm the customer , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA @-@ boss P@@ ru@@ itt draws for decreasing the rules of Obama &apos;s Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; one day after he had been accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , decided to delay its former decision to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of smo@@ other pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities in relation to response times faster than previous administration . &quot;
&quot; he did not mention the law@@ suit , which had been raised up against his previous position in a German Federal Court . &quot;
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for States to stop the standards of 2015 for bott@@ om@@ less o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , announced that he would hesitate to give compliance with a year to study the plan to study the plan and to hin@@ der the plan in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ General Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time to become a reliable opponent of environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly been repe@@ ating or delayed , to block the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden change of wed@@ nesday is the most recent legal revers@@ al for the exp@@ ir@@ atory escal@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA for@@ wards had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane cks . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply simply hit the read@@ iness of EPA in cooperation with the states through the complex process of tim@@ ely fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administration , the EPA often did not adher@@ ed to the dead@@ lines for performing and then waited for the implementation of activists and others , and in an agreement concluded an appointment for the implementation &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt carried out its &quot; impair@@ ment of delay and all other legal framework &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in the Congress push for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; one of the last month approval of the bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the measure was not yet to vote in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man who led the Coalition of the States who had denied the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York , which are directly affected by the smoke which flows directly from the tu@@ g , said pr@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in this case , California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Io@@ wa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ sy@@ l@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; soil zone arises when pollut@@ ants are produced from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight . &quot;

tum@@ ours celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church is invited to an old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ lingen on Sunday , July 16th , at 4.@@ 30 p.m. at a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;

&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is unique , a unique small treasure . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ al document : &quot; count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the proud parish church &quot; &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the publication of the document , on the Tum@@ my mountain apart from the former parish church , a magnificent courtyard , too , belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Ober@@ dorf Freu@@ den@@ stadt in 1858 , along with the Lower village and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen today , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the grand settlement of the village . &quot;
old cards from the time around 1600 are under@@ mining this historical ge@@ aring .
the patron was created out of the early medieval y@@ ho@@ ist law .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church , took place and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church , and could also inherit this y@@ ho@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a priest or Bishop a new priest . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the Lar@@ ger of the two ends on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created Glo@@ cke was first made in 16@@ 92 but had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 .
&quot; during the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window washers have been stolen and the bells were stolen . &quot;
the roof was uns@@ ett@@ led .
in 1796 the French troops en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the Church threatened in 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius ch@@ urch@@ yard served as the final resting place for the dead from hearing aid . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the steep@@ le was left .
&quot; in the New Year of 1834 , a storm was over@@ thrown by a storm and the half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demolished . &quot;
&quot; only today , the Tur@@ m@@ ts@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness to the 750 @-@ year old church history . &quot;
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em is the support of the &quot; Schaff@@ dier retired &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;

Association wants to check permission from Win@@ dr@@ ä@@ s
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim blo@@ ws himself , &quot; doesn &apos;t see any legal requirement for the construction and turned on to the coun@@ sell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; has ordered , &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ded ( CDU ) is requested to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal to be un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of the approval of 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen , there exists a wind power concentration zone at the time . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy plants are generally possible , at the same time , the concentration of wind power supplies for the rest of the urban area . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days ago , the town of Vier@@ sen decided to have a second wind power concentration in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but the district government was not approved in Düsseldorf , due to a lack of formations . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirement , the requested per@@ mitt@@ ance decision was un@@ lawful and thus decl@@ ining , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , President of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
the current state of things : in front of the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette approved ; a approval from the District government is still standing .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; that is , at this point , the issu@@ ance of the construction of wind energy systems were excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received since past week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; said a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the circle , it takes on the occasion to test the matter again . &quot;
&quot; they do not lead to it , however , that the procedure will be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view on ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the district court has not been responsible for the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build on a surface at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , the construction of four per 200 metres high . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company was involved in the town of Vier@@ sen , P@@ acht@@ ler talks with the owner of about 65 hectares of large ground @-@ area . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy plants , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to around one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the past summer , there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as an investment in a wind energy system in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor together : Mrs. dies with horri@@ ble accident
one terrible traffic accident has occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am at the L 333 between low @-@ fl@@ ashes and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn Circle ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more people were injured .
the state road remained blocked over hours .
&quot; after police report , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch ran with her passenger car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person the L 333 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
bath Lan@@ gen@@ s@@ alt@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the commercial club and municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants for shopping in the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the commercial law , Christian King , announced the &quot; homeland @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend to make their customers sensitive , which offers its own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
native companies should present themselves with their training places .
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center should invite the &quot; mit@@ ter @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; city . &quot;
&quot; the promotion does not only aims to inhabitants of the city , and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , advertising spots on the radio , a Internet video and printed bags looking at the stock weekend , says Christian King . &quot;
city administration and Trade Association collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
so the commercial club and the city enter into a further stage of the project &quot; Attra@@ ctive Centre . &quot;
&quot; to this end , new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest with sell on Sunday , talks with all the tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the signing of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should be new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
local guests and tourists belong .
but many natives have lost the city center during shopping .
&quot; at the end , everyone would contribute to bel@@ li@@ fy the city center - to land@@ lords , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it sailed with a network to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y , which partially spread themselves , had said king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , divided into five Thuring@@ ian cities in the nationwide third &quot; home Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ si@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be &quot; more powerful for the appreciation of local trade and its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the action under the lead of the I@@ HK and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can also be able to influence its direct environment . &quot;
two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
during construction there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new more people were injured .
&quot; at a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine other injured , some of them difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , there was still a last critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died as part of a school building during the explosion .
&quot; a first Ver@@ mis@@ ster was later born , also dead . &quot;
&quot; at the dead , employees were involved in the school . &quot;
&quot; as a turbul@@ ent matter , authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the holiday season , only few people stopped in the building of Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump set up through the trans@@ lu@@ ded tran@@ scription of telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall .
tran@@ scripts from telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump returned to a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to stop publicly that he would not pay for a scheduled border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president compl@@ ained him because he had den@@ ounced the Wall . according to report , he said to him , &quot; This is not able to tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to establish a wall in the southern border of the USA , and to pay to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ halle has also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia , would be ridicul@@ ous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after he had said Mr Gy@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ ase as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driven by a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous suit - took a long turn on his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; clo@@ aked the man .
&quot; get him from the car ! &quot;
&quot; the silence , when a young black man was dist@@ orted by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; , almost all in the audience was very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Citi@@ zens came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - were gel@@ ded by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has ever been indicted for the mor@@ de .
&quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all those years no single person was arrested - even though we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who helps in the organization . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spots on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of the State Georgia and a Life @-@ Citi@@ zenship .
&quot; for him , the reproduction as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community , that an in@@ justice was never corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want a pro@@ secutions , we want the termination , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we get righteousness . &quot;
a court @-@ medi@@ ator puts a towel over the l@@ ath of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 1946 .
&quot; according to the FBI agent published by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men were suspected of Monroe and the surrounding Coun@@ ties in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision made by the Supreme Court of Justice made the black citizens of Georgia for the first time to admit their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at the same time as the election st@@ ach , according to the FBI , Roger Mal@@ col@@ der , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a struggle - allegedly committed because of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our was in the city , that H@@ ester has slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , paid a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey in prison .
&quot; but when she went away from prison , and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge passed away , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the murders and ordered , &quot; includes a FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in murders that removed the evidence and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it &apos;s pre@@ conception .
&quot; it was a electoral massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot;
&quot; almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene led the annual reproduction of Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , att@@ acking , and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism , which many believe that he doesn &apos;t exist in America anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are then confron@@ ted with its hem@@ at@@ ern@@ ity in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t want to convert any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to listen to what I did . &quot;
&quot; rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - into a room and lu@@ te , as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of boss C@@ lan@@ head for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , play their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ ch from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a er@@ ev@@ ites the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks out ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still k@@ ich@@ ing . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- he said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; wit@@ ched one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you just have to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there is the energy in the room , a feeling of camera power replacing the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene will start once .
&quot; this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is terr@@ ors , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , clothed with a tragedy , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and brings cheap Holidays , &quot; Strange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks out with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of around four dozen spectators and tears came out of our eyes . &quot;
the audience is equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a pair has arrived from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the road . &quot;
they have experienced in almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as oppressed humidity when bro@@ oks they live on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has stayed an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now if you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels dispens@@ er . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and to inspec@@ t the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks to their heads , register the fake blood and the breast@@ feeding body and whis@@ per@@ ing one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; they mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy when he wants to remember it . &quot;
&quot; after a couple of minutes , Gre@@ ene of the quantity - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
actors throw the Lyn@@ x arrow and wi@@ pe off her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w h@@ ug@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the sound member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his fellow players and breaks down in their arms . the emotional last of the performance eventually breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; she whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sit together with the actors .
&quot; at a table , a white pair made of Atlanta excited about the position with a black pair , which they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky had fought words to find words which have left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... by people who look like yourselves and do that , because they look like , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does it really do with me , believe me , that the Lyn@@ chen still continues , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; today is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks &apos;s farm stands on his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a certain way , because she describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who does not study his own history , who doesn &apos;t know his own history is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; the u@@ ter@@ u@@ chs &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf is reli@@ eved of a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e st@@ aging in front of gigantic , six story back@@ drop . &quot;
&quot; the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) , displays a sh@@ ab@@ by road corner , with the wall @-@ edge and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ ements &quot; logo from DDR times or New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhine le@@ thal was posed as rock@@ ers , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; min@@ ted oil subjects remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ pes - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - harmon@@ ize as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you will carry Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , mur@@ m@@ ur in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and put a cor@@ pse in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious area of Hagen who surro@@ unds the A@@ ura of a heav@@ y@@ weight @-@ box@@ ers .
&quot; brutal the scene , when he strikes Siegfried . &quot;
later you have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Mark oak ) .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated with modest and his hands at the Merkel @-@ cat@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a large appl@@ ause for the Fest@@ spiel@@ Orchestra , which shows the first time on stage - in view of the large heat again in le@@ gerer . &quot;
&quot; with tension , Frank Cast@@ orf and his team were eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ous whi@@ st@@ le concert in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; one not@@ ices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she said briefly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding for its visibility . &quot;
I draw a positive res@@ ume .
Max Quant@@ ity works as a volunteer
&quot; they work in their volunteer year , at several places . &quot;
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in the furniture of stone , once in the week I help here in Gre@@ ven , the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at school .
how are your experiences with this ?
&quot; amount : it is a nice , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so it is a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does this come ?
quantity : I have made high school SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a building engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully abandoned . &quot;
&quot; I recognized for me , that it &apos;s a folding for me and I want to do something else to work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps , really . &quot;
and it was so ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start studying in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different applications during the volunteer ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s always going on , where you can be FS@@ J . &quot;
you can make it from the old @-@ house to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partially in O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
unlike in Civil Engineering ?
&quot; amount : sure , here it is not about to calculate statistics . &quot;
&quot; there are always other people in front of the head , each with a very different story behind him . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a youth , who has been picked up from the family - you always have to go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is a field that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but this way is life . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son don@@ ates further 3,000 jobs and short@@ ens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , it will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ ding by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure with which the company is confron@@ ted . &quot;

&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber , attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital of Kabul , attacked a soldier of NATO and several others , say officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and interpre@@ ters were injured , a statement by NATO . &quot;
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ Arabic , three civilians died . &quot;
&quot; the bombing is the last violent crime in Afghanistan that month - on Tuesday , more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by Nato , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; alleged &quot; &quot; of persons . &quot;
the statement says that all the last in a stable state will be treated at Bag@@ ram &apos;s air@@ field at the airport Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dent say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ Arabic , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of which were in the capital . &quot;

EPA does the decision to delay Smo@@ g rule according to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ ating what the states are obliged to en@@ cers Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was carried out a day after 15 States were accused of the agency because of the pac@@ emaker . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said that she is showing the obligation of agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and hereby we react to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , in June , had announced the intention of the EPA regulation which should be measured in a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where in@@ sections must be delayed until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday , and said that effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to raise a wide range of environmental monitoring , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda that aims to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature groups who are worried about the effects of larger emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function &quot; can rein@@ force the respiratory symptoms &quot; as asthma . &quot;
Municipal coun@@ cill@@ or wants to be shared space
&quot; at the end , the decision was clear : the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ es decides to set up the establishment of a common room in the future shel@@ tered area . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic piece was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; even though the church community has been in possession until the date of the church community has been in possession , there is now no planning event for the project from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price .
&quot; management and majority of the community pending , such a common room does not only look as the meeting point for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ rous living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made a round . &quot;
&quot; the decision is sent by providing funding for the current budget already in the last autumn , through funding options . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be reported , T@@ j@@ ades , with 60 percent reduction of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision is fore@@ seen to signal the investor that you don &apos;t want to throw him between the legs , as well as P@@ ult@@ ant &apos;s legs , which makes both the tr@@ ash @-@ level reduced and the construction of economic power - as well as possible . &quot;
&quot; un@@ necessarily , so does not only think Wil@@ fried sole , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously it happens the body .
it &apos;s not as easy as in the common room .
&quot; Daniela Call refers to the many own buildings , with which you are not so progres@@ sing , that it is now in the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; I do so hard to do so . &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against an public participation .
it sees behind a covered sub@@ sid@@ y in assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; unless this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface you don &apos;t give a supplement , but will receive a real , in doubt , is the counter@@ act . &quot;
&quot; to apply the petition to follow the decision , three advoc@@ ates finds . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposition voices at the original program that Stefan H@@ aller will summar@@ ize : &quot; if we accept the decision , we make a huge step then , a huge step in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision with car : cyclists is tra@@ ded on road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cyclists was hit by car in Gar@@ ath by car and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old e Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been travelling around 12,@@ 20 o &apos;clock with a bicycle on the road from the road , Schwar@@ zer road direction Hil@@ den . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last , that was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes on an increase in performance in the first official compulsory play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great trust that my team shows this qualities .

in Har@@ z from Star to Star
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star path &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planning the club ob@@ servatory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star path &quot; come to meet the needs of many har@@ bours , whose name was it . &quot;
&quot; it includes nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
members want to set up along the planned route tablets and inform about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the club plans &quot; well @-@ reaching installations at five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; in@@ qu@@ ire of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , brown @-@ position , Hoh@@ enz@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables should be completed by Internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the site selection . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
&quot; later , the star@@ path train should be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the club . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star is more enlighten@@ ed than another , although it is much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation can be used to find a selected star and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , on the highest mountain in northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection in the middle of the National Park , Har@@ z ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; often , from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da Galaxy with a mere eye can be seen . &quot;
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , it has been on the initiative of the sponsor@@ ing Planet@@ arium Göttingen something similar to the planned star@@ vation - the planet path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting in front of Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to Hain@@ berg and ob@@ servatory , as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( municipality track ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the tri@@ ples with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are precisely in the distance , and a scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the Earth has shr@@ unk so to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures 75 meters ( less than 70 centi@@ meters away ) . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is good four kilometres .
&quot; during the light of sun up to the Plu@@ to about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour up@@ to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in space .
&quot; the march to the next fi@@ f@@ ings , however , would take half a year . &quot;
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia that should stand in a coll@@ ision course to stage the most exciting boxing fight in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles until Garcia , the un@@ designed World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , went down to the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ Feder@@ er champion . &quot;
&quot; according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Garcia put forth his right hand and said , &quot; How are you doing , Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7@@ pm on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple was posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ managers Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; remembered Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I am up to Bron@@ er &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down . I want to come down .
&quot; and he must move on a lightweight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; , and then we fight . &quot;
they desire the fans .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that will fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year to arrange a date with Garcia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their light @-@ weight victory in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked after him , &quot; &quot; Garcia and pushed it openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names may produce this kind of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
&quot; Garcia said he grants Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; a huge fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think the tri@@ athlon champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side view &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... You were willing to co @-@ off the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Garcia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could sense the moment@@ um , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
this is the fight that needs to be performed .
no other struggle manages so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work with it , &quot; &quot; Garcia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I was waiting for the top fighters , and this is Mik@@ ey . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four For@@ get to T@@ ire Plat@@ zer
on Thursday afternoon four people were injured in an accident on Thursday afternoon .
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was lost at 16.@@ 30 before the entry into the market , probably after a ty@@ re @-@ placed control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car ran to the right in the ar@@ ches , where he over@@ turned and then remained on the roof in the ridge . &quot;
four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the decline in the rescue service , A7 towards the north was blocked for about one hour , then traffic could pass through the road strip on the left side of the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; dirt chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann is hop@@ ed for the season 2 : 2 , at the end of the season , that the optimization of the def@@ ensive information takes place in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first seasonal game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , as they were not the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must watch in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ ender from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the triple chain should also be optimized . &quot;
and a fool after a stum@@ bling don &apos;t want to catch the Fort@@ un@@ as too .
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will be on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will also make the experience in preparation with the dirt chain better , than with the fourth chain . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , but Hoffmann is sure that we can just build on the semi @-@ positions at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; requirement is , however , that we are still harmon@@ ious and we don &apos;t afford such a lot of waste . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can &apos;t talk about a mis@@ erable start , I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance might well be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the trop@@ hy , we will certainly be able to talk about a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
he wanted to know nothing about his coach .
&quot; the start in the season , I only spent six to eight games days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim was cancelled due to a temp@@ est . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh since they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a climb in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know that 100 percent where they are currently standing , &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the Rhineland , guests from the Rhineland , go as a little favorite on Sunday in the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , it is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ kel , the balance at just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there are no team in the 2nd division , which one must propose from the pre@@ hen@@ sion , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as Chef coach . &quot;
&quot; such statements would be arro@@ gant and excessive . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel wants to see his players on Sunday in no case .
new results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Ri@@ ode@@ gra@@ z ) has begun to carry out tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should be more precise , after the Swedish migration authorities ( mig@@ r@@ ations ) was crit@@ ici@@ zed for errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , mig@@ r@@ ations sent 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person could possibly be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot;
tests are done only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly growing during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person has been judged as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has to be over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and told that there were 4@@ 42 cases to propose that the subject should be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet found the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said that she was 18 years old in this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical care assessment , which are analyzed in the rays of white @-@ rays , and MRI recordings of knee joints , which then be analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do it as if we could it , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is where the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
works on the three bridges of the Highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ tonne of concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern local entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Construction director at the Department of Transport and Transport at government offices in Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at the same time at all three gentle bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and is sure to keep the schedule .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is disgu@@ ised with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come to the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and transport security , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on Wednesday morning , has a 1,@@ 30 @-@ metre wide and seven tons of heavy @-@ called glasses . &quot;
&quot; this is a Rand@@ y attachment , which is also used as a shop road . &quot;
&quot; in the southern part of the bridge , a width of 2.@@ 20 meters will be used on Friday . &quot;
&quot; then , then the pedestrian walk@@ way should run . &quot;
&quot; the particular thing is that there are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tip has the wiring of lines required by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; in advance , residents were informed of the projects through a hand@@ book on the project . &quot;
fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be refresh@@ ed .
&quot; for the bridges between the building buildings and the collective , the traffic in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction on the bridge at the foli@@ age b@@ acher &apos;s entrance is the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bri@@ dging operations amount to 700 000 euros .
it is financed by the country .
Af@@ ol@@ stein in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ illed with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so frequent that parties should move on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else can be difficult to bring with a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows peac@@ efully on this day because the African Union in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell will invite you to the &quot; large election campaign . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and famous names start to start - like Alice Wei@@ der , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , forming the top duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already in front of the event at the beginning of the event , do not want to listen to the African developers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; Show more on a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now take place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and just before the eyes of those who come to the African event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful image that offers you .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , are pleased : &quot; great as many people have joined here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad &quot; &quot; which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police force many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , but shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how has the Af@@ D come on Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
&quot; Mario Hom@@ pes reports from the Af@@ D volcanic island , he worked for such an event and received the supplement . &quot;
&quot; initially in Dau@@ n , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there is no cancellation because of the already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes there is not enough parking spaces . &quot;
&quot; now , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; with views of the event at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; this is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peac@@ efully . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock , the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ platz is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle of various speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ whi@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the world &apos;s top @-@ term candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch keep their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the police force remains unchanged , but so far , officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour takes the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there &apos;s already some 21 hours . &quot;

Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both uni@@ fies the lust , not only to exceed the borders on their instruments but also merge the limits of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach on the two as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; uni@@ fies himself with Bulgarian Folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz photographer N@@ ils W@@ W , mix classi@@ cs , jazz and the free games to a fascinating overall arts . &quot;

Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about their bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and will eat it until the end of their lifetime . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stewart openly openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I bite in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood star has been the &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , which ultimately became bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette actors opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love in love with whom I copied . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; according to their separation , Kri@@ sten was to bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed in du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ der me .
&quot; I never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; however , according to &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school days , she rather dre@@ aming like a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children I would look like a Bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and sh@@ atter@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; now I look back and think me : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they would not like to love their love : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps I call myself some und@@ an@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify me before all the public . &quot;
Virginia Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump , that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; if you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thinking ... today I will tell you as the inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a major announcement in the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not viol@@ ate the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . &quot;
Justice that is the only billi@@ on@@ aire by Forbes was elected in 2016 .
&quot; Forbes states that he has grown cab@@ em@@ ins in five states , and inherited a carbon business from his father . &quot;
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening issued a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would rather go down to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 Gou@@ vern@@ ements and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the final re@@ jection of a party that is from top to bottom and not able to find a positive , reas@@ oning message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honour@@ able &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for D@@ oping scandal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , comm@@ ended on Thursday what he described as an evident ap@@ ologi@@ zing from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to go to the sport again . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF congress , Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF World Championships in the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the prohib@@ itions of his country was correct and that he decided to fight the d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those in cont@@ ests gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; in spite of his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was executed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) not@@ ices to state sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought there was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation itself has seen itself in itself , that it will experience some rather hot times , and everything will be possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
CO@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia should accept the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think progress were achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the World Athletics Championships that begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfill some of the criteria for a revival . &quot;
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden coach charges still free . he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral for Mali ra@@ ced in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the northeast of Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two were considered by a helicopter drop in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high safety precau@@ tions .
&quot; to still un@@ clari@@ fied crash , Defence Minister Ursula and the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing . &quot;
they described the two pilots but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of their specialist . &quot;
&quot; we bow before this highest victims , which they have achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen were killed on Wednesday of a week in the West African Mali .
&quot; their S@@ är@@ ge were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a death @-@ wake of the Bundes@@ wehr , in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter . &quot;
&quot; at noon , only the relatives of the church took farewell . &quot;
&quot; afterwards the funeral service began in the circle of family , eng@@ ster friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics . &quot;
among them were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Assembly of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wie@@ ker .
&quot; trau@@ mas made ro@@ ses down ro@@ ses , and the members of the arm stood in arm in arm . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ ed and many soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
defence Minister from the Le@@ yen called the en@@ cap@@ tive soldiers called &quot; highly decorated &quot; and one of them .
the Chief Inspec@@ tor has built the flight operations of the helicopter tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regim@@ ents .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent , among which the soldiers were , declared : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the crash , nobody would have mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali has not been the author of the Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the war@@ ms were brought from the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr doesn &apos;t make any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants not a grave besides his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is enclosed in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
the Queen would agree with the decision of their husband &apos;s decision it was further in the message .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik , be buried , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
but he does not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made it a h@@ eh@@ l that he was not happy with his title .
after the thr@@ ill of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to be king .
&quot; in 2016 he retired to reti@@ re , and he also puts the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik does not receive the title and the function that he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent in his wife - not after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the director of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old was ultimately to be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he is not the intention of being taught in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the past 50 years .
&quot; Mar@@ gre@@ t@@ at , a son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London in 1965 . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
&quot; during his late wife , the people ever flew to sympath@@ etic experiences of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious state in his almost 50 years . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik above the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk str@@ amps instead of stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ ls that I smoke instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco , and they able to be the call to be the brand of social intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope in night . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants to make a rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , he doesn &apos;t want to return to a rapid re @-@ election of the country day . &quot;
&quot; because , on Friday , the Parliament &apos;s resolution was made . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising outlet of a Green Party in Lower Saxony led the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country election the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scar@@ ce A @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP .
the old Green dep@@ uties of El@@ ke T@@ akes established its step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ou@@ ler wants to recommend it to his faction to record them .
&quot; the CDU and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony &apos;s Day , SPD and Grü@@ ne 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the New Land@@ tag will be elected to the 14th January of the year .
Th@@ sm@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government had to decide whether they could rule in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , holds it indispensable for un@@ intenti@@ onally that the Land@@ tag decides quickly his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on further progress on Tuesday .
&quot; the country version also sees the possibility that the State Parliament will elect its trust and cho@@ oses a successor . &quot;
&quot; our Constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be examined by legally clean , &quot; &quot; Th@@ um@@ ler said . &quot;
&quot; in peace , you will discuss all the questions if they are legally verified . &quot;
th@@ umb@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something short . &quot;
the political scientist himself stressed : &quot; I &apos;m not tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described himself as a app@@ ell@@ ate of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the revol@@ ting dep@@ uties on the return of their country day .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they receive their land @-@ day , which she has received over the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; shared the state of met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the S &amp; D Group president , An@@ ja P@@ IEL , said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ akes . &quot;
she deliberately decided to run no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; in front of the background , that there was no intimate differences , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
&quot; SPD Federal Chancell@@ ery , Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the Chief of the Sax@@ on Green Party El@@ ke T@@ akes to CDU as betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of former Green M@@ EPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the S &amp; D Group on Friday on Friday . &quot;
&quot; he supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , which can quickly choose the Land@@ lord &apos;s decision . &quot;
the Austr@@ o &apos;s exit is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the political scientist &quot; in her injured vanity and in her Fr@@ ust her personal interests in front of the country &apos;s good interests , crit@@ ici@@ zing SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
&quot; it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ spiel , trying to beat out this political capital . &quot;
CDU fra@@ ction@@ ing of the CDU faction leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ou@@ ler wants to recommend its dep@@ uties to the CDU and El@@ ke T@@ akes in the CDU .
&quot; the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , rejected T@@ akes , with personal career thinking about the outcome of the 2013 country @-@ election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest party before the SPD , but the SPD and Green had a small majority in the same day . &quot;
&quot; Home Affairs Minister in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the scandal pass ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
&quot; in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) , Land@@ Minister , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) speaks speech and answer . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can the consumer protect the pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer inside and consumers to check out the eggs in your fridge and check the emp@@ iri@@ cal pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the information about the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , according to everything we currently know , a health haz@@ ards are practically impossible . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut up immediately and has since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s parties in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all the information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade has just as the manufacturer to concern , that the sold @-@ selling products are in@@ capable and harmless . &quot;
&quot; if the resi@@ li@@ ent temperature of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not transport . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs can , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the establishments are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after such knowledge , the production plants does not meet immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of services . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are too little control in the harvest . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or even on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , they were just the official controls which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth , however , belongs to the truth , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent information of such events and the hand@@ over to the constitu@@ ents in the cases are of crucial importance , are of crucial importance . &quot;
I have already done several times that I expect a mosquito control by the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm function at food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer goods and consumers have the right to get solely safe and competitive foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumer are distur@@ bed . &quot;
&quot; through the pan@@ cre@@ ed funds , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are advised into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pro@@ il is not acceptable in the attitude of life @-@ based animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately . &quot;
it must be consistently implemented on all levels and worked with high pressure .
I expect from all responsible authorities that the atomic fact is settled .
how to move the financial rules of football to Paris on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars &apos; move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to aim to prevent und@@ eter@@ ised issues of the European football club , Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to French Paris @-@ Saint Germain do not inter@@ fere with the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA yet , because the leading organization , which over@@ sees the European game , has the power to offer teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial fair @-@ play rules , which have been launched by the UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point some point out that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar was funded without large losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) in order to recover the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can easily make money to make money , so that Ne@@ y@@ mar writes and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy @-@ rich rulers of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may turn up a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must communicate with legitim@@ ate revenue sources who allow them to go to the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; after his election , FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini as the UEFA president in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their quest for success , had effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ked to ru@@ in , when banks or owners moved back their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from the concentration to the club &apos;s debts to monitoring their losses . &quot;
the change meant that Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then invested strongly to improve the crew and build a global brand - to be a tough@@ er affair .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P processing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini is fallen from the presidency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his UEFA successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to deter them from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA für FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out @-@ Cl@@ ause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract . &quot;
Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements .
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 gave the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was given a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members will be limited to 21 players for the Champions League of the 2014 @-@ 15 season . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to consider their financial statements by taking their revenue by companies that are associated with owners of a clubs . &quot;
&quot; while a cat @-@ based company could spon@@ ges the PS@@ G value , if the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; just this happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the PSA was blo@@ wn up by Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ y@@ mar will come to Qatar for payments of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar have disputed that Ne@@ y@@ mar World Ambassador will be to be to find out a man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA regulatory authorities .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEFA is still attentive , to avoid any attempt to avoid the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEFA had no prepared discussions with PS@@ G via Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press since they were not fu@@ eled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of 54@@ 2.4 million euros with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last fiscal year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was definitely irrit@@ ated to see one of the best soccer players , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Weg@@ ener by claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; fin@@ alist D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish newspaper AS in regards to Kat@@ ars , the official owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose club is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservation of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger to Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair FA@@ IR@@ PLA@@ Y , because one can have different ways or different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new Sch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; over the past few years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y on board has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the kis@@ ses cooperation in front of a possible end : the airline writes the order .
&quot; at the request of the news agency S@@ DA , Swiss spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed a relevant report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ wel@@ z &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to the current planning , Air@@ line will close a new contract during the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be reviewed every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the latest suppliers Sim@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; approx . 17 million small rot@@ ten packed com@@ it@@ ers to 14 grams per year spread a flight leader before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss no information wanted to do about the costs .
&quot; industry @-@ insi@@ der appreci@@ ates the order volume according to &quot; Northwest Switzerland &quot; at 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more import@@ antly the advertising effect : for a p@@ og@@ gi@@ ous producer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; like many applicants , on the new ten@@ dering , the Swiss doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers come . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y wants to stri@@ ve an renewal of the Treaty via the spring 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA the biggest Swiss chocolate @-@ manufacturer was not accessible to a statement .
&quot; since 2006 , the Swiss chocolate bars spread its flights on board . &quot;
&quot; before leaving Swiss a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had supplied the chocolate @-@ tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , Swiss conducted two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .

many of the central stories are the same .

and there is another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious Plot to be involved in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ ward ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the Ex@@ t@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ avi@@ d signatures by &quot; Singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old Kn@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; they are the moments of random mad@@ ness that might make this fran@@ chise . &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : twenty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band as they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is now reminis@@ cent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;

the main rol@@ lers - a hard @-@ named Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i ; the dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than one idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags to see ( the police ref@@ uses the time to watch chess in television as Americans may do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - among them Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find the voice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda self @-@ drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Reagan mask , it is often like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , which has been shown on a lower length , could always deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re better , since Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef once again visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who bur@@ gers a bun@@ ch of Hamburg . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a gel .
the fic@@ tive Romanian Creator failed : we even make it with our own younger history and with her .
impact on drug @-@ Mafia in the country
the police was a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart were searched numerous objects such as the Office of Constance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 lab@@ elled at the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warran@@ ts already issued warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; during the same raid in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
on the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed in the field .
&quot; the members of the Mafia was accused of drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was established against organised drug dealers in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the public authorities in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contacts with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; hence , the large use on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the visor of examinations , Italian students enrolled in relation to Italian Mafia . &quot;
&quot; even a incident on May 27 in hat@@ s , in which early morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , is likely to go to the bank account . &quot;
way to acc@@ ede big g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens , which should not appear to appear : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable defects in Germany . &quot;
lead to partial fail@@ ures in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to media management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a media report presented to great g@@ aps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; according to the data registered data , for asylum procedures and deportation orders could lead to partial fail@@ ures , in an analysis known as the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the regi@@ sters , ten million people are recorded with foreign nationals , among them about 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data are therefore administered by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been maintained enough , the data quality has not been well done so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases data were found from 1921 , &quot; of people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ing data inputs can significantly slow down back processes , &quot; says the report after further . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on foreign people , the EU citizens are recorded , which would not have to go out . &quot;
&quot; however , such false declar@@ ations , however , led to a debate on how to deal with &quot; &quot; trav@@ ellers &quot; &quot; means that it is therefore stated in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children after Italy , when they arrived there . &quot;
this go from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ back Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F will hold such procedures &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , the newspaper has been practically no longer possible , so the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Dublin agreement , the EU &apos;s refugees is responsible for refugees to come first . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back to the country . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the office is now called : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has been significantly increased . &quot;
Italy handed over for the recording and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) are sufficient for this commitment .
other EU countries would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internal political speaker in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threatening due to the lack in Italian asylum system of human rights and a threat of childhood . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach died a total of 220 litres of blood vessels already available for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , which were presented on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now sold 50 litres of blood in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church announces the annual read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is gen@@ ial how our body is created for it and we will provide respect for donations that make their blood for foreigners , still un@@ profitable , &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one only blood don@@ ors helps several people , explained the super@@ visor of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserved foods are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported the actions that performed in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Kreis@@ ky manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change@@ over to the theatre house has led to higher attendance over a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and met@@ a Um@@ berry were among the multi @-@ workers , were awarded for 50 years . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the inflation of inflation in the spec@@ ulation over an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; s@@ lugg@@ ish &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a sustained pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 , to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , since weak economic growth has increased its support for an increase in this month . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly annual inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 to 1.6 % and warning that the pressure on the budget would continue to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it was sign@@ alized that in the next few years there would be zinc threats to breed by the Bre@@ xit , and she said that loan costs may have to rise more than expected by the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth business package , which was issued prior to a year after Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will require time to provide funding for the financial plan to provide budget funding from the upcoming February , although it is expected that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in the frame of this system - with 115 billions of Po@@ unds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains extremely short , as pressure on the real income of households continued to consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for cooling down inflation , and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent would be required than the markets anticip@@ ate . &quot;
the markets currently projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank estimates that Incre@@ di@@ ctions would be &quot; progres@@ sively &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast revised growth forecasts for this and next year , compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May . &quot;
it maintained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound dropped after these messages from the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appointing growth figures have applied increasing expectations to an interest rate of interest and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months , to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover during the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the most recent annual inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by an increasing inflation and lower salary levels , as the sharp@@ ening is still worse before they became better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years can &apos;t stop the income of income , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their thir@@ ties &quot; will be considerably &quot; recover . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is strengthened by the rising demand for British quality , which is attributable to weak pounds , which is compens@@ ated by a lower consumer expenditure . &quot;
the decision comes to a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in the last August following the sho@@ cking EU voting that caused the sin@@ ks of the coup .
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to complete the prices and economy .
&quot; prior to the last judgment of the Bank at the Bank &apos;s interest rate , the call was increased after a loss of interest since the inflation was on hard @-@ pushed households with three political decision makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the inflation declined by 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank said that this was expected and put it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the aims in relation to their target of 2 % is &quot; absolutely &quot; to the weak pounds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ale , Director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest way of s@@ wap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive , as the credit@@ ors are looking for businesses looking for a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who exp@@ orting the existing de@@ ans and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is to prop@@ elled HIV @-@ drug 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV @-@ Con@@ venti@@ onal treatment in September after a struggle against the financing of the medication in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before the sexual intercourse has been recorded , the prevalence of infection in high risk factors by around 86 percent , now being delivered by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he prepared herself ready to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court in the past year , that the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the record announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described it as &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to follow the application of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be launched in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ positioning hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a consequence of HIV drug which are taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP was significantly reduced by the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection .
Pr@@ EP prior to sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body of a person present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come to question for the treatment are gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants will be identified , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
&quot; people who are living in England and registered with a resident , can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will cost £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs in this week after an international competition pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the whole potential of Pr@@ EP by which clinical evidence is collected , as it is implemented in large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to improve HIV and take over .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in managing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of the NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted to have targeted and endangered people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September on , people with high HIV @-@ risk have access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individually controlled and will not be subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , President of the Hig@@ gins Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be accomplished that the study is quickly conducted throughout the country and that no one has left the risk of HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ aments was created , we are on the best way to protect over 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ dows Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and over@@ due for months of delay and delay . &quot;
&quot; the evidence shows how trans@@ forming this drug as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and termin@@ ate the transfer of these life @-@ changing infection . &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as fast as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life living : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ note with passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 by a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to an Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something that was comparable to my prize .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; I loved in love , and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; originally a single room estate with a f@@ iller layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Jo@@ anne storage room and a mezzanine to optim@@ ise the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she instructed the architects and designer Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not just a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; to be creative , Er@@ fan had to be creative to release the submission . &quot;
&quot; the steel structure is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other , without having to g@@ aps ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about to build a simple platform , but put the steel that he had the right height above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
for the mezzanine has a classic copper light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us across the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
a short Cor@@ ridor is mir@@ ro@@ red on both ends to make it longer .
in the kitchen you feel like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous noise , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if they are not used . &quot;
hing@@ ed kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineers went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF . &quot;
&quot; it is always important , so if you push the door high , very easily gli@@ des . &quot;
&quot; thanks to clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor space , and use high @-@ quality materials that make its own luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be turned out by good design and increased income of slightly standard in something completely .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not . &quot;
we fight for a 500 million US dollar empire for a 500 million US dollar empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation for one of the largest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how your property and its business amounts will be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp move on the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in the Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin is described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ on - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court of jurisdiction says that Colin is owned by a value of $ 316 million and Paul in worth $ 176 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to mark Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ance point .
&quot; the nomin@@ ation of Colin filed by Colin made him left with what I held for the best objects , in 2015 he wrote in a first aff@@ id@@ av@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday . &quot;
&quot; the brothers also struggle to control over the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , have ruled him . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed , this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some owners in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was submitted by Colin , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi , Italian immigrants , were operated to milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
you used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says he began in West@@ co as he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , were hoping to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi told me often that he never wanted to land at court in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lut@@ on company group , with Colin claimed that Mark had been paid for the company &apos;s 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark , then Paul says , &quot; Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept himself very well though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography in 2015 from Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media started with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers in contact .
&quot; only Colin made by SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to satisfy the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would like to end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope in a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; says Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the Media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media , hoping to hold the boss on a uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met his first working day with conduc@@ tive employees , he set up a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : bad news that goes into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or mail@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; wa@@ it@@ ory diagnosis makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ ame dr@@ ump by super@@ vis@@ ing his media monitoring . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship for television goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , its television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if there was a candidate of Tr@@ ump because of an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were convinced that he said to the former election campaign Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February , compared to the POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key , tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it consists of control to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter needs ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
perhaps these fighters official know something that we do not know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets have even contain more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never find something about twe@@ ets who did not send tr@@ ump .
&quot; when his employees made it a few times , his troubles came away from him , then their effort was worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevent , that Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy emerged . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem exists , that people in a white house , together to present themselves out of competing parties , attempts to present their own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , possibly promoting their views from the world . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - busy with this history - reported in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to bring the pre@@ sidents of strategic reasons for doub@@ tful information .
this was an example described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump as a volcano can react to negative press clips , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he might find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when somebody accused the president of mal@@ icious writing a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the vice @-@ president of K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ban@@ ished because of Sch@@ ik@@ ans permanently from Twitter , or that he has no specific evidence , or that he expressed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask employees of Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump of paper . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still under influence . &quot;
this un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .

the police force throughout Europe in this summer ( virtual ) postcards of dangerous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of selected s@@ crimin@@ als are not known to us , references from the population will be hop@@ ed and pray . &quot;
Europ@@ ol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &apos; EU Most Wan@@ ted &apos; adv@@ ent calendar of winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many volatile and holiday villages hide , it was named by Europ@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; it was compiled for 21 postcards covering 21 EU countries . &quot;
&quot; since 2016 , website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ok , more than 2.5 million times have been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online companions were so far been arrested , at least eleven of them due to the release on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers take action over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ är@@ s &apos; series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again standing with some un@@ closed trav@@ ellers on the b@@ are@@ foot , which have negotiated one from the church , in order to rec@@ la@@ ve a field before their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
&quot; passengers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and a army of transportation , after being taken out in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated gr@@ in to prevent their failure . &quot;
the tac@@ tic group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section called un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent away from Bentley Heath , where stones have thrown onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced to act in fact , because it was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the trav@@ ellers were moved there in May , and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; yesterday evening was coming , probably more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; The Council of Birmingham knows how to re@@ circum@@ vent long sub@@ mitt@@ ances in order to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my local dest@@ iny when the Council can &apos;t even stop it .
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of this traveler , only to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased , and even one horse has seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokesperson for the Council of Soli@@ hull said , &quot; We are aware of a bearing bearing on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police force of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps to continue as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our mobility collection , it is very important that as many residents sign a anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; to do this in order to create a picture from the situation , in which the court needs to consider when we submit our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former ambi@@ ance of the company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights went lost per year and also revenues by the local fee . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , given the dramatic numbers of refugees who came in the district , the hotel building was offered to the coun@@ sell@@ or , which was provided for controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up an building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
&quot; however , in particular , Freud &apos;s Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel &apos;s location and said already at that time for the home @-@ growing interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ Hotels Group , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object has four houses .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Mann@@ al@@ b .
&quot; Lu@@ ise Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been a long time building container in front of the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear that large renovation works will be done . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings to a part destroyed , ancient bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
all should be renewed in the Black Forest .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input range is converted , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; beautiful , &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; they are not positioned at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a elevated inner city level , emphas@@ izes inner . &quot;
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms are broad@@ cast@@ ed wide and explains Sch@@ erer further .
&quot; both tourists , groups or business@@ men are to feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so cas@@ hier . &quot;
the performances of the city are covered with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to set himself exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; outside systems are also brought to the fore@@ man , that is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace created in a courtyard , which is open from the restaurant that is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Jury sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair of US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury according to a report . &quot;
the body has recorded the work in the past weeks that the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote to appeal with the cause of confi@@ dential persons .
the newspaper valu@@ ated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the transmitter CNN reported , there is already the first loading of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps , eldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin for longer , targeted in the presidential campaign in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps Ele@@ ction Bal@@ aam and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller took even more and more tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a couple of weeks ago , the Washington Post , wrote that the Sonder@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally moved to the center and seek the alleg@@ ations to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair may hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to consider evidence of evidence and decide if the prosecution is to be charged . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called upon request . &quot;
&quot; usually , they are turned on when larger and controversial cases are involved . &quot;
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be switched on by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons under E@@ ide .
&quot; according to the transmitter , CNN already issued pre @-@ lad@@ ders who turn around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were asked to be a statement , in the report it was reported in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and s@@ son in J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam@@ aging agent Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were talking about the conversation . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ wing experts said on Thursday evening in the US television that the consent show that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be needed , quickly act . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have to be hot that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the Gre@@ mi@@ um &apos;s inclusion in the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason for the concern of President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations &quot; President on Thursday evening there was a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the topic give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
&quot; his special adviser T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he has been ignor@@ ant of the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this also work usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ate any measures taken by the work of the Sonder@@ ator on &quot; fair &quot; way accelerated .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the pre@@ sidents .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something changed , it was written in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this ro@@ oted , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump had become loud , he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for an appointment of the investigations against the then national security consultant Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under large pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; after a presentation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the Sonder@@ ator and its employees . &quot;
this appe@@ aling spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent special specialist of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , in order to rep@@ ay the president Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could fired on the president of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but prevention .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators , on Thursday , according to which the special message could not be released so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , there has been a gigantic ice@@ berg from the scar@@ city of nearly seven times of Berlin@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it shared the Alfred Weg@@ ener Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine research on Wednesday , Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometer large Kol@@ oss now runs north and will probably take two , three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; it is a length of 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ice giant , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent , climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the iron ore , is un@@ clear after research . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , for some 30 years , there has been an extraordinary interaction of ice r@@ ying in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact @-@ background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ae .
scar@@ city flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aciers .
&quot; therefore , it grows further into the sea and breaks regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ bows is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this Sch@@ el@@ age was the equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um of wa@@ xing and ab@@ rupt@@ ly distur@@ bed some years ago .
&quot; the A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen has been broken down there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C swal@@ lowing in danger , because the front edge have never been withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the iron sla@@ b stand under tension and can be crushed if there is a piece of keys . &quot;
&quot; melt the melting of sh@@ ackl@@ es and ice cream , the sea level doesn &apos;t increase as they push on the water , and ice so much water as it yields in the melt itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the scho@@ oner carrying the glacier leads directly into the sea directly into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only a small extent , writes the British research project to observation the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ bows is the fourth biggest scra@@ p of the Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI @-@ data . &quot;
&quot; on the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural happening and no direct link to climate change , the iron sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the wid@@ est retreat since the start of records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists may be disputed whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ae will now grow again or fall in long @-@ term , and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers have the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg non @-@ change on climate change , however , in recent decades , many sk@@ ill@@ eries of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been destroyed . &quot;
this long section of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Columbia , British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the temperature increase has contributed to this decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated over the past 50 years and t@@ aming about three degrees in the areas where the temperature is at the fastest time .
CDU wants to lift their heart rate at staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy , free jobs , the CDU , from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
just before the summer break the C@@ ret@@ ali@@ day 41 new jobs arrived in the administration .
&quot; more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
now 17 trainees have their first working day behind .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very desired .
about 620 applications were given to record places in this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle continues to be able to cope with the Asc@@ ended requirements and tasks . &quot;
at present there are still 50 coun@@ ties in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers and forces are sought for general administration . &quot;
the CDU would like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG and compete in the administration of professionals .
&quot; according to the wish of the parties , the administration will work a concept for recru@@ itment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term demand for professionals , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ orient@@ ated candidates . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should look inside and out@@ ori@@ ent , concrete measures for cross @-@ entry display and a training offensive , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems you did not know it before .
other cities advertising good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is from a real &quot; competition &quot; competition .
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees gained from the service of disease or age @-@ related diseases . &quot;
&quot; therefore , highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , President of the CDU , will go beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he already looked at the chal@@ k day for a fine surprise , when he posed the personnel cost public in question , and the rest of the parties was bl@@ ossom . &quot;
&quot; people want to be reviewed , that all options are checked , which allow the exit from the communal labor association . &quot;
&quot; if we are not at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the gy@@ mn@@ asium with the trade unions - maybe even in cooperation with the affiliated towns - may also achieve a home rate . &quot;
&quot; in order to make the CDU , the employees and officials better to pay better than tariff of tariff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , enh@@ ancements or more money is only if one changes into a higher level , orient@@ ated to professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the duties of the circle have grown steadily over the past few years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up , in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law . &quot;
&quot; last but not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tened the tone to NGO @-@ migrants @-@ rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs , use the life boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue to continue to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code code , it &apos;s difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; &quot; Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti said in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning got a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German aid organisation &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human hands in a way that lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation since one year , refused to express itself with Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority for us . so we are very sorry that we can &apos;t operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all pay attention , which are currently le@@ vi@@ ed , first , after all the information collected and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &apos; Youth R@@ ained &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew of din@@ gh@@ y migrants will take on board , which can be delivered directly from human hands , and that s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one of these meetings took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the markets of the government , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation has been suspected to complain about the authority of Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone of humanitarian grounds and not out of any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code code , boats must have used boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly in Italian police officers , who monitored their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations are now ready to keep in the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , because they don &apos;t have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate Organisation for Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , had decreased in the last weeks that the efforts to strengthen Libyan Coast Guard and cooperation with the local Civil Society . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali have measures to reduce the number of migrants who left those countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
ascent and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the Northern Turkey for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
&quot; the first tour went on hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle , above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; there followed look@@ out spots , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the pl@@ agu@@ er forest and the bearing planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were still longer periods of climb for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the People &apos;s Manifest@@ o market . &quot;
&quot; again look@@ out spot point to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ ats &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate pace . &quot;
&quot; over the last two days , many of the altitude have been announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins , ruins . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers w@@ aged the bi@@ kers in the free@@ wheel content of healing Sole .
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 meters of altitude , the group had learned the parish forest of his best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga for e @-@ sport
&quot; the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of wit@@ ness@@ ing at the wind and weather over the stadium @-@ friendly ? &quot;
&quot; fact : E @-@ Sports is long ago become an increasing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high quality . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal government , which increasingly engage in this area . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young target groups for V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says President Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is sure , &quot; that some associations will rise again . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organiz@@ es the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; in which the gam@@ ers can compete in different clubs . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian region . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E athletes under contract , one could be present more often by far more often in these markets than once a year , to send to Asia as a year . &quot;
what is it possible ?
&quot; at the E @-@ Sport computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will focus on competition layers . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport , Li@@ es have long established , in which the pros can compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asia &apos;s 2022 , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all about a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is safe . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has also dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions show that can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress changes , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should not only train at console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
but there are problems too : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming increasingly a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online gaming , and in the scene failed the structures of classic Sports . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ise a positive impact of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are international on the road , that &apos;s like a big global family , there is no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ or . &quot;
a study by management coun@@ selling Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) pre@@ dicts the E @-@ Sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to be 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the football league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ant . &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ bask@@ et@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
even in Europe there is quite a lot .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , bi@@ rob@@ ber@@ y says . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football @-@ first league @-@ league clubs are broken down according to D@@ utt , a e @-@ sport department . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter , for the lyrics , condemned Conrad Roy to suicide . &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and they were subjected to par@@ ole five years . &quot;
&quot; Carter was sentenced to death by Conrad Roy in June for the killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free until his appeal .
&quot; it had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives went on to argue that both her and Mr Roy came on a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and one cream @-@ coloured ble@@ use , Carter stood here with tears in the eyes , folded hands and in the eyes that they were condemned . &quot;
&quot; his actions were killed by Conrad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the State lawyer . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she took over no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she showed no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ver &apos;s lawyer said that it was a &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they completely regret . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; age or irrit@@ ation &quot; or even their mental disease have no significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I &apos;m going with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , for his sisters there is to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she will be persecuted by the realization &quot; &quot; that she would never be taking part in the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have , with which I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep for my life always with me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to commit suicide . &quot;
&quot; Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle of carbon dioxide , when Roy was found dead in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the case moved out of national attention , after having revealed text messages that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , spring from a building , inv@@ ent yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent them in several weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing that you have to do is to switch to the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should take advantage of the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; one of the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to death in Italy for murder in 2007 , was acquitted of murder of two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Knox , 30 years old , published a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua K@@ imm@@ i was allowed to run the Audi Cup as captain , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern mar@@ ries the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner a great season - Extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; something else was there on his place in the cabin , the Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the additional garment is very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since wide and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was seen , he made himself up with him to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach doesn &apos;t have announced , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner was back after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
it would have better to run better than at 0 : 2 versus the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could be interpreted as well .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just chosen from the vac@@ ant professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a game guides , but he . &quot;
Su@@ gar@@ bage is distributed to those who want to be a lot for those who want to keep in La@@ une .
&quot; so if anyone who are retired , the heritage of the Lah@@ m can only be used , can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ i confirmed : &quot; that is what you want to do as a player : responsibility .
on Wednesday 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as a mini @-@ lame .
&quot; at the right behind , this is now its position , the white bin@@ der on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this starting formation as the one that can also take the ru@@ dder into the hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , attempted to draw the un@@ installed tro@@ upe . &quot;
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
&quot; V@@ idal to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ks hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus att@@ ends to the achievements of the Asia trip ( fol@@ ks only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le should not fall negative at their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
that still works quite well .
&quot; in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y before the def@@ ende , ran both . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and also the sweet@@ eners had a few times successfully . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave to the fact that the result was not so , as we hop@@ ed ourselves . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance at the debut .
&quot; playing siege , speed change : &quot; I got even fet@@ ched for this style . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ used this Bavaria @-@ world , for new@@ com@@ ings , one looked at the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two , but six or seven interviews in cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich passed on a few cris@@ p statements in his new fellow @-@ player &apos;s back .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le another interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what is going on here , now I noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the New Testament . &quot;

&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge has the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the largest turn@@ around sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the circuit of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country now , at the top . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Ministry of Planning is hoping for planning to stand up until 2021 . &quot;

&quot; Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are faced with a counter@@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ president said that &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; it is smar@@ ter &apos;s options &quot; &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based on vehicles or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that three million Mercedes cars will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprise as a recall .
&quot; European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States , to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions . &quot;
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines em@@ it , are considered cardi@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automotive manufacturers , systems to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles , also take advantage of what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies attempt to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which were used to regulate the use of so @-@ called off @-@ age devices to keep the rules when a car was tested , but at normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were indicted by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in engine development was arrested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is an Italian and is therefore not being protected from extradition and could be put in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi became involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen , after the authorities tried to handle the system to handle the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could make Volkswagen hard @-@ t@@ ass@@ ware : the luxury car manufacturer is super@@ proportional to profit from Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ n@@ oses and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most widely published Carto@@ on Dra@@ fts@@ man , the cre@@ st of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 records , the Argentin@@ ier still stands and works in a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , because there are too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he struck himself among other things as sig@@ ner for lucky cards - which fru@@ str@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris succeeded in a breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of its carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
&quot; again , the artists were inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish mor@@ dil@@ lo pieces cav@@ orting in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting by his own data on the drawing , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; cal@@ endars , Pu@@ zzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and watches find its d@@ rol@@ s figures continue to spread much dis@@ sem@@ ination worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series for six years .
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los any popular animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ man as a counter@@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie which should come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it &apos;s strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he rather puts on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , will be produced . &quot;
lavender from Provence on Climate Change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is falling due to drought conditions and caused by diseases of borne insects , what scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert in the agricultural research firm CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the Lav@@ ender del in Provence is effective , because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the spring of last years and much more in the autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil sp@@ ends not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; rather than very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and weak@@ ened either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; thus , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered to be considered , are a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the Ass@@ assin@@ ation of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce will normally meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days , to check their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organized crime , corrupt civil servants and in@@ cess@@ ary drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the target of an attack with gren@@ ades in 2009 . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have three words on a table on the front of the room : enemy , neutral , ally . &quot;
&quot; ask the rep@@ orters to propose names for any column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal feelings . &quot;
&quot; drugs are drug g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there are no rest of violence in the country , and throughout the country the bodies are more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto continued to join in December 2012 , and now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter you are editor and her In@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; he wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is perceived deeply , although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Val@@ dez , that shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; put on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ ce building . two rep@@ orters in the thirty years , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez , bear T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ark . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Special Representative of the Federal Office was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , this was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders each year associated with drug traff@@ icking and organis@@ ational crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely challenged . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tra @-@ east and although the terrain is now av@@ eng@@ ined . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not the Why , we susp@@ end everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he made it only to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was shot by two men . he was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with &quot; &quot; 12th River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Schüt@@ ze drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans was arrested last year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the country &apos;s blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story mouse to drugs that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the ri@@ val@@ ing cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in war with Gu@@ z@@ mans sons were announced in February . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have off@@ ended the children , suspected Gang@@ es bought every copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was in this , Val@@ dez not to force her , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story , the country to its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues received that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism , without encounter the ri@@ ddle d@@ ash@@ ore , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest coverage , and the turnover and the advertisement took . &quot;
&quot; reporter loved it , hard tre@@ ading investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the reader were fascin@@ ated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Award &quot; for their reporting in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect Journ@@ alists for his courage in pursu@@ it of Mexican drug history , wherever she led them . &quot;
he gave himself up that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug traff@@ icking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; said he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you must take the task to help you as a journalist - either you or you &apos;re playing the dum@@ b .
I would not want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ak bird , who was able to curse the Spa@@ ak , the generous with hu@@ gs and rat@@ chet , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar over the office , go there and always sit at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for the routine his cal@@ am@@ ity ?
&quot; his death , too , forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can do their work best and staying alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret start and run@@ ways , to tackle drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ aging and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ ances .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , lead it away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of Ri@@ odo@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no longer - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ rati@@ ves s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the scenery is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones was allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
there were two police protection from the heat of 104 degrees outside the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
&quot; they were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ class building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the joke , some of the rep@@ orters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter went into the mountain landscape , where the drug abuse are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has bent on three main layers . &quot;
there was the murder of the brother &apos;s brother Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state spending , which focused on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that was placed in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who has been kidn@@ apped or as it was done , so it was given to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politicians , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , who ruled almost all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ car@@ cases of corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter to write about previous inci@@ dents in this eating house , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man was sent to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the reader discovered the column of Val@@ dez than the best informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its stream@@ lined body style . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the Office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers who prot@@ ested against the murders of journalists , dedicated to something that they had never expected themselves : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; reporter Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez made a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration , due to another journalist to the office of the public . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ams disappeared after three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials , based on DNA tests that it is its . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists were loud by organizing the &quot; SOS Press &quot; organized in organized protests . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; with a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day following the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pi@@ ping out journalists and to bring them to the truth , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked that she is again divided by the government , because she is concerned that their anger has injured their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organizational crime , involved with government officials and an equal society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; wrote that reporter did not only be killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; was assigned over half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die , because you want to keep the mouth , &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the murders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one forg@@ eth the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
your body was found together with a note that was report@@ edly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am for my reports .
a computer keyboard and ear@@ phones within its separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ro@@ sl@@ ava Bre@@ ach in March .
&quot; others continue , as it did El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug Cart@@ el with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and seek dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently , like the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was assassin@@ ated in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue work , it &apos;s a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , gives evidence that the drug traff@@ icking is frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I became reporter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the pav@@ ement before the office and drank beer , when all their phones started to sum@@ med . &quot;
a number of shooting @-@ shops with belt ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left no deaths .
&quot; the war goes on , as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region . &quot;
&quot; from the Bord@@ st@@ int , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers to see if they were in read@@ iness .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when it was murdered on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practition@@ ers asked me to send them to the road on the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to soak up their enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , although a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have received so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his sli@@ pp@@ ly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said , she had something of a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology , &quot; described him as &quot; the immort@@ alized din@@ osau@@ rs , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well balanced state , researchers , who , as &quot; really remarkable , &quot; bl@@ oss@@ oms it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the red plant @-@ car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ser is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Radio , when he died on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
&quot; discovered by him , F@@ ossil was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you have blin@@ king only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it was slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to see . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs specimens , the mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res , although it is covered with a arm@@ our and resem@@ bles a wand@@ el@@ ant tank , probably threatened by flesh @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily pat@@ ched din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide in front of prey , and used a par@@ ach@@ uting technique that is used as counter @-@ dict@@ ation , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings , and to rever@@ t to its enemies , experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell called , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours , it carefully worked carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter , a widespread defense method in the animal rich , meaning that the tip of the creature was dar@@ ker than their under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the console is usual , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the size of the living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r of enough pressure was hun@@ ted by flesh @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that the evolution of the con@@ frontation was favourable as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of contemporary animals that use the sha@@ kes - think of deer , zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ d@@ les - are much smaller and viol@@ ate as a prey , that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , strong ch@@ un@@ chy din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ b of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous must have been &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their sc@@ als also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs is rot@@ ted .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his preserved Dar@@ k@@ hal@@ tes , to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , pushed into a river and pushed into the sea , where he fell on the back to the ocean floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was so warm like South fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it remains fully covered with preserved skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal reserves &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as in the early cra@@ yon .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if only a little with the eyes of Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived some millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the pan@@ zer@@ y din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose newest knowledge appear in current biology , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Radio , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ our , and is completely from mu@@ zzle to hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long sp@@ ik@@ es that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the pan@@ de@@ fied plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was pushed through the Western Canada , to a flooded river in the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
&quot; the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved , that the skin rating still cover hol@@ pri@@ ge arm@@ rests along the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko , written for National Ge@@ ographic , is such a level of conservation as &apos; rare as a profit in l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will be . &quot;
frozen remn@@ ants of the skin cover still the hol@@ low tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : massage @-@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a massage @-@ sp@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long st@@ ems - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , some 20 people were injured in the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the first data of the police were at 17.00 o &apos;clock between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 cars , including probably trucks , in@@ flo@@ ated . &quot;
there are no information about the exact number of injured persons .
&quot; it is a slight to medium injuries , a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher said . &quot;
a large offering of rescue vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a ten kilometer long retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; as a AZ reporter reported , it also occurred in the opposite way to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade not@@ ched the signs of the vehicle le@@ bar which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and passenger car .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the road to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once again : nothing really sits on the train , and sleeps . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
&quot; in the midst of the workflow , the Schaff@@ ner and elev@@ ates a gli@@ mp@@ se of the workflow . &quot;
ticket check .
but the times of breaks are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn currently test@@ ers the create ticket control .
&quot; it is easily confirmed by mobile , that it is taken with his seat , and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
currently a test run runs on two routes .
&quot; coming from the offer , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available to many more remote lines in Germany in the beginning of the next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; is called by train the ticket sales without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use it , however , some requirements must be met : one requires a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what happens already most of the passengers .
&quot; you have to have bought it via the App , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works as follows : you get into the train , calling out his ticket under &quot; &quot; my tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will be released . &quot;
the train manager will get a message on their mobile devices a message that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y .
&quot; the train att@@ endant of the ticket inspection at No. Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already @-@ driven online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - which is to take advantage of the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel without a ticket check through our train@@ ee personnel , check in the DB navig@@ ator simply himself . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB correspondence . &quot;
&quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; our employees have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who are often train , knows that beside the late and missed trains the ticket checks are among the greatest troubles . &quot;
&quot; in any case , however , in any case , one of the trav@@ ellers do not have any documents in any case you need to use online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the recru@@ itment card or otherwise a document must be seen .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train conductor and handling , which leads to bad mood in part or large space and del@@ ays in the control of your own tickets and will take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and that is , on the connections , ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
other train numbers on the same track are not available yet .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ?
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to her core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment was sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene in the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ roll@@ te by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year old child , and it is still on the street . &quot;
&quot; confused , since no one had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly praying at their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
&quot; he posted an image of Bro@@ wns @-@ bl@@ os@@ em body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s wil@@ dly , &quot; I thought she thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone to twe@@ ets back at the evening of twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; they observed a live feed , with whom a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebelli@@ ous dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , un@@ secured his ri@@ f@@ le &apos;s ri@@ f@@ le , cried , saying , &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered its testimony . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , to which we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us , and which we can call it . &quot;
at this moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept .
&quot; she booked a return flight , and went home the next day . &quot;
&quot; after landing at 23 : 00 , she repeated her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , of strength and resistance that consists of the point of people living in community life and have filled the streets to ask answers . &quot;
&quot; when Fer@@ rell wearing her daughter who contributed a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remin@@ ded her what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police has killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not correct . &quot;
&quot; I could not bring her away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
&quot; what is happening today , is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot;
it has to know and see it and tu@@ cked up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution , and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have lucky enough to give her an experience in which she was personally experienced rac@@ ism , it is not different than the next black women . &quot;
&quot; I feel it , I would prove it a bad service to keep them far from far . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , found himself at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police agency that was awaiting a Camp@@ area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner , who made lunch . &quot;
&quot; they prepared bags , and helped them to pass through protest@@ ers . &quot;
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vism on Fer@@ rell form .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed after August 9 , she said and not@@ ices that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Fol@@ a@@ ah &apos;s evening demonstration , one of the film co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to document &quot; document &quot; , &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came about Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to be docum@@ enting or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often benef@@ ited from white - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently said in an interview : &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for its acti@@ vism . &quot;
his commitment brought Fer@@ rell the project closer together with six other local people followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . &quot; we speak , &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me as these people are represented , for so I will be presented . &quot;
&quot; the aim was to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but around a community that comes together , &quot; said fol@@ ay@@ an - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s life , how she loves and marry her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that this work must be certain in this work , and in the realisation of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black @-@ gay women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , which had marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in 2012 , identi@@ fies the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identified himself as a gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; however , Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sted that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rell was selected as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a coincidence , although it was at the front front , because in a life at these cru@@ ises as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense its energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the r@@ att@@ itudes between the municipality and the police continue to remain . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she kl@@ es herself to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory , since they went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on in three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV reader discuss about bits gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves people , although it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the sw@@ ending of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation in 2009 has become the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
cold leaves the topic hardly one .
the theme is also discussed at our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; .
&quot; while the one to say to the Bit Gallery : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side , &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ ing ) or completely simple : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which other businesses are prof@@ iting , fear the opponents , that then the pedestrian prec@@ in@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery will be planned on the grounds on which the farm market stands in which 13 constitu@@ ents tra@@ ded their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction , it will conclude with that . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a square with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost every week in the farm market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ women always enjoy very much . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s but@@ cher have discovered for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is also .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of rent . &quot;
&quot; however , this is probably not low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping spre@@ ader in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dr@@ illed or supermarkets : I find the superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there are already enough in our city .
&quot; one sees how many shops are empty here , some have been here for months and years . &quot;
&quot; however , since it is not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains at least . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is ob@@ tru@@ ely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you see , shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger firms , because the Mi@@ xed Mi@@ ets are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops , there are almost no more and what else is left , will disappear as well . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle fit for me not together .
and the gallery will not fit Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peas@@ ant Hall during construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming out sometime .
or does it already create a bit @-@ gallery beforehand to distribute all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not functioning .
&quot; and a shopping center that stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a farmer mark@@ thalle it &apos;s thanks to the mad@@ ly many - how I find - sensu@@ al building projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
&quot; when the peas@@ ant hall is capit@@ ated , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost un@@ noticeable , which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the c@@ utt@@ ings out of the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service provider had served a 35 @-@ year sentence after they publicly put diplomatic news on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline did their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , who was transferred to Barack Obama as he only had three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could be created by Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits have been created , a sharp comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has been openly spoken of identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accus@@ ations , including six violations of the spy law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison , her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing sits idle in a driver &apos;s seat and has been associated with her . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; it produced the artist &apos;s portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette st@@ rolling and che@@ wing gum , in order to extract the DNA from the waste , in order to produce a picture of which people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press show of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were forced to un@@ equal letters that ex@@ er@@ ted several letters in the course of two years .
&quot; they even created one by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ erte comic , &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which was predicted to convert a future in which the president would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ings release his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , a welcome type of happ@@ enings . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Star@@ kes , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ t from government @-@ camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ eter spl@@ its , which he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are going to happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of Galerie &apos;s artistic statement , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ big signature among them ( the &quot; i &quot; in their family name ) an end of the &quot; automatic cr@@ ushing , whose foundation sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture have been . &quot;
on the opposite wall their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As is written in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed to show the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide according to the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how surprising , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what humans are hopefully going to take away is that our gen@@ ome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell us so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a site from the mentioned Com@@ ic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; it shows Mann@@ ing , as it emerg@@ es with a hands @-@ lance holder in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States , as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your words , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist that gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
I &apos;m still going to see when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was supposed to be taken out in the comic book - but if she should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation that leads to their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulation . &quot;
&quot; it was also aimed at all , as all in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , which were written with their genetic h@@ ap@@ ort groups with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a human being , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed itself with Chelsea , as the movement that burned down behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University for murder
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway on North@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , which had been sought after susp@@ ects , after a man had been sought after a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued on Monday for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acquisition of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; a major warning system by the Chicago authority of Chicago , states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found victims with several injuries at his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared on the site of the event for dead , and Det@@ ectives will examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are searching for the two susp@@ ects , officials said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president of the university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em was now excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue that will examine by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University cooperate in this investigation , &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a speaker at the University and the Man@@ ville College , said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Italy in contact and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot;
&quot; the statement , added that War@@ r@@ ens colleagues were sho@@ cked and want to set himself up . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he was demanding the susp@@ ects of susp@@ ect the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has a presentation of its place , and our efforts to locate them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , which had just received a smo@@ othing tip that had just happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that it was un@@ clear whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza team published a statement to the residents : &quot; the police currently works on the time axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic presentation . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA @-@ tim@@ etable in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said that it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA @-@ tim@@ etable has been updated in this regard , &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; commenting on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA , and recently published on the organization of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he doesn &apos;t contain anything for Russia &apos;s cause . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list of criteria , however , states that Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities approved the findings of the WA@@ DA approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to publicly accepted D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation , because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has been added an error . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit something that doesn &apos;t exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os agree with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the director of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales office R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems in the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report lists more controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als by the WA@@ DA by D@@ oping control in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di sells no eggs anymore
they shared the business groups .
&quot; it could be assumed to be a mere precaution , it could continue to be assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it said in the announcement . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs are expected to be delivered to Al@@ di who have been demonstr@@ ably tested negative on fi@@ hal@@ ted anti @-@ lungs . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to produce clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company to become the next U@@ ber
Amy Her@@ t wanted to measure the luck at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not use the p@@ olls .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke an@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Savi@@ our , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed . &quot;
she created people from outside around help .
&quot; a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing , in order to help companies to find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through the creation and licens@@ ing software that has the specific purpose of the staff commitment , it allows companies to provide surveys , speci@@ fying staff and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ n allow to handle the C @-@ Suite executives and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your business ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; salvation said that they think a better insight into what your employees think , and feel it in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the S@@ nap @-@ surveys and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows that units most complaints and what executives do low access results - so you can drill to why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you must not be the next U@@ ber which has been involved in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee describes a blog post in which those who have spoken is punished . &quot;
&quot; for Start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth by 2020 according to the funded technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behaviour and recognise , saw a rising interest and activity in the beginning of this year , in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ cell@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convert nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber recently signed up as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Company can send customized &quot; Pul@@ s- &quot; surveys , view confi@@ dential answers in real time and view the warmth @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
&quot; it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , to report with the employees of bad behavior . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leaders are involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of public opinion has captured the reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is po@@ or@@ ly treated or un@@ eth@@ ically speaking , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cott , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , the Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , can be used to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and are a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a telephone number or e @-@ mail to the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; there was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , said that there was no good possibility to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now since the company Conver@@ ted , the company can only be identified by managers who were previously sitting in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ loud practition@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I can move closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view in experience with jobs , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders before employment dispute . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen started to merge due to ethical crimin@@ ality through the Enron scandal pl@@ agu@@ ed by the Enron scandal . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies knew you were not able to prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to surveillance of ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t as well as Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and ass@@ els the company with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find joint venture Capital investors that have both start @-@ ups .
&quot; convert $ 10 million to finance in February by companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ ancing secured $ 10 million in November by Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought its entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex in research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than ever before . &quot;
high salary and interesting projects are only in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley .
the employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that will feel their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile to make this enterprise successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience in Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ ted and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ites when their portfolio businesses are well running . businesses are running well when employees are committed and involved .
&quot; if the analy@@ tics tools are third @-@ party promise , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
data about the staff commitment after experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is us@@ eless when the ste@@ wards of a company does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it can anticip@@ ate that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the shift does not come quickly , or at all , this may be dis@@ appointments and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 discussions , &quot; &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen himself too much for collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about yourself ?
&quot; and if you do not worry , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , which now performs monthly staff p@@ olls , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training , to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights over the staff , and it hopes that a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a branch that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
and if you lose clients , you will lose company . &quot;
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the brood
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football player on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .
some have moved out their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
&quot; players who are registered to the summer course will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their final tests , before they return next morning at 6 : 30 to Water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real pedal mill , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer said Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
the N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 will begin to meet the players already fully packed periods of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise of the two days is more than one day , in which the brood went to the beginning of the camp nearly one week after the last season , during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six games times in West@@ wood , practical exercises . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal rules for their start to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he will support the control of N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point of time . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they simply pressing it , they keep plac@@ ks , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think we will come back to Saturday and we will have more time , it really will be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which has been thrown by a neighbouring car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the elevated class that has already been replaced with foot@@ paths , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem when these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not to think that people rent a room there and then to set up a practice there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the Vide@@ ob@@ and of a Exerc@@ ise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best we do with what we have .
I &apos;m not so worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit detection on fac@@ simile testing of third parties and their results under the original contribution , this is the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine methods to detect possible counterfeit messages , and to send them to fact the results of fact check out from the original article . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News that many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
&quot; the problem has become a great political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters have been flooded with false stories in the run @-@ ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany should not succeed if they did not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled mail@@ ings like before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German , that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge that stories of fac@@ ades over third parties , people want to find more context to make well @-@ established decisions on what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara , product manager for Facebook messages in one blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to test his feature to &quot; &quot; test in connection &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his messages , to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ he was a lo@@ op@@ hole . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of his cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript by someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only respon@@ ds to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter which was written by a double @-@ stage in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his Dau@@ men@@ ding pressure !
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for it was kind@@ led a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has a effect when it would be even involved . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who has been beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and has lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have made my welcome pit a little exagger@@ ated &quot; ) seems to be true to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the vi@@ kt@@ ori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives , and the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the palace , such as the mon@@ ished hy@@ ena heads for the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape @-@ care , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists he worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night , he drank . whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received the full access in 2006 , when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he spoke than &quot; hundreds of years in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , get it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps that had what had : &quot; you could mean that land @-@ conflicts could be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection uses the castle as a starting point to chat on the British history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar that occurred in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant uprising began in this area and I thought , a revol@@ t was a good start . &quot;
maybe they are connected together ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle , like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it patron , who was hidden for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , depicted in the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , filled his own funeral , filled a sar@@ g with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his s@@ coff@@ in was dug out ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; men seemed to be quite a man to make debts , and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men extingu@@ ishes their school crises , giving them rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; after the conclusion of his revenue in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scre@@ wing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ en@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the grounds of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been returned by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : more than 300 years old Mari@@ chapel covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the sealing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ ak@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Frankfurter Rundschau ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z want to hold the logo and slogan . &quot;
at the end of August it will be a celebration of the festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th island .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
or ? &quot; we ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ köp@@ ing Chapel .
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write it on its yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action there is more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a unique promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique item . &quot;
&quot; finally , in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a mid @-@ digit rate , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan is afraid of the army
&quot; every year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over retirement and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is how this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces , one year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting took place no longer in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government there were also the five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
thus the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the number .
the government forces the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed cou@@ p , head of State Erdo@@ gan has fired the 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan of the coup . &quot;
&quot; for 4@@ 86 people who should have been involved in the coup attempt , this week is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was named &quot; Pra@@ gi@@ ve@@ away &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is the army really in the handle ?
&quot; in the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ na@@ ire in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff , Bes@@ org@@ has appeared because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , manifest@@ ing itself among other things in raising the head ban for Sol@@ dat@@ ors , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the big clean@@ se of the army and the security forces goes on . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 State agents , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , as Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed through the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als earlier than the true gent@@ lemen of the country .
th@@ rice p@@ utsch@@ ded them under appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the sec@@ ular state .
&quot; following his election victory , Erdo@@ gan ruled the power of the military step by step , not least for calling the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is targeted by an Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the &quot; Voc@@ al Europe &quot; magazine , &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ known officer , who sought for asylum in favour of persecution abroad , and the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , such developments could not allow Nato to be cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance according to the pur@@ ge of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; managers and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; NATO diplom@@ ats say . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he is looking forward to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , and more str@@ ingent regulations for the provision of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the USA , like citizens from other countries . &quot;
the law will stop the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidate who will speak English to support the financial funds to help themselves and show knowledge that are good to our economy , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , quoted from the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants distance for racing transportation shuttle
&quot; again in the past few months , over the future of the race @-@ launched race , it was supposed to go fast . &quot;
&quot; still before the end of the year , the tourist railway line is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race station in the long @-@ term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is scheduled to start in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to continue to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ ingen and to san@@ e , the country is particularly important for the tourism important link , &quot; declared road Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the over@@ h@@ aul of the route he reduced to approximately 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country exceeded 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will be defin@@ iti@@ oned , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry and the Southern Con@@ ür@@ ingen , as an operator , are already eng@@ aging about the technical details . &quot;
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the used vehicles and quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
thus the race @-@ Shuttle should be ordered at the end of December 2017 .
the race shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au train stations and the road@@ platform .
&quot; in the course of a pilot company , in the course of a pilot company , the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is strongly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry about .
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots are coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le , and type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; the people make themselves funny about it , but the company deliver every amount of it , and we will see it much more frequently to see , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicon scal@@ p which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also custom@@ ize its robots to &quot; &quot; custom@@ ize &quot; &quot; and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or colour of his finger nails . &quot;
&quot; but it will still be troubled , because many robots own &quot; personalities &quot; who would like a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots with a silicon scal@@ p .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows users to adjust their robots to the properties which they are appe@@ aling as for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there is still the true companion of the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; , which convey@@ s the impression of ti@@ mid and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; like that , what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
it has also its mood during the day - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many be@@ wil@@ dly aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ lined female properties , rec@@ eding at Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resi@@ den@@ ial ) Far@@ rah , un@@ quiet one at most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy then ? &quot; it is on the site . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement show a bit dar@@ ker and deep in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality in an option to having sex with sub@@ con@@ formity as an optional allowance . &quot;
&quot; most men are of course not having sex robots , and while FR@@ R remembers their rising popularity , they still remain temporary on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak out of the boundary zones , can be in regards to the spirit of time , in which we live , very in@@ structive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange , or ins@@ ulting , until the free market gives permission to this . &quot;
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that this highly developed sex robot in a time sc@@ uba diving in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a pre@@ sidents in the White House to have attacked women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the bond@@ woman &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the swallowed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots exists , a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot;
&quot; their builders want it to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , at the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , the robots do not represent real women . &quot;
they cannot be separated from their companion or just go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or a background history , nothing that could inter@@ fere with independence or anything to distur@@ b the imagination . &quot;
otherwise stated : they are fake slaves .
or to express it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy lives
&quot; it has become a Bin@@ sen@@ na@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump era that the political spl@@ its , which have split the U.S. elec@@ torate , even families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest , there were newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to inter@@ act with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ related relations . &quot;
we are all pleased to allow us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families to accommodate families . &quot;
&quot; I will mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left di@@ et@@ ine that lives in Chicago , has long been working with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she rec@@ alled that unity against a common enemy may have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can relationship with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks associated with itself . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presidency has power to move all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky way that his m@@ itt@@ ens should not encounter any more day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a troubled long @-@ term scenario , norm@@ alized in the Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards suddenly as the ep@@ it@@ ome of understanding . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today from an active nostal@@ gia to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s strange version of the Ver@@ de@@ cks - the dog on the car roof that looked at 14 % of income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) was in fact , as opposed to tr@@ ump in fact , as a very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump passes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally , in order to qualify as un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the kar@@ st &apos;s car park , and the top three dollars that can be found in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cra@@ cked and the animals are turning round about their own shoulders - extremely fin@@ alist and the lim@@ iting music makes it noticeable . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines will be familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be justified . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the topics pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not counted , but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magical experience here , as here are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women going on it and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I had to evaluate the kar@@ us@@ sell , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked about it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to assess my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before going through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman at the Kauf@@ haus stand exc@@ use , while I was tired of the experience , to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved to the hospital with chest pain
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the jail for a hospital for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of s@@ lei@@ gh in hospital , which he suffered from prison agencies following a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder in prison for murder . he was sentenced to murder for murder .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that his girlfriend stayed for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal int@@ ru@@ der which was hidden in the cabin .
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to submit their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it was too dense . &quot;
&quot; the National prosecution authority said that she will lift an appeal at the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the claim can be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is running at risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the vier@@ lander made from feeding and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into school holidays and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
the school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil house of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school@@ ing , the 29 students of the four classes voted by Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des a young eag@@ les that grows in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sh@@ ar brought a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and sent it out of his chicken .
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but hope to make out of him a chicken , the eagle spread over a high mountain apart from the wall . &quot;
after that the classes were three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank .
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for the integration , he said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; however , the young is different than the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
wish every four @-@ t@@ cl@@ er that he feels right in his new school .
&quot; on the colleague , the former school leader Michael Müller , who once again jumps in teaching position , followed the parents &quot; parents . &quot;
&quot; the Kü@@ ken@@ zeit is now over , the school teacher Sophia Schumacher announced . &quot;
&quot; they leave their students after two years of lessons , only very un@@ demanding , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ t@@ ä@@ ss@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; for the conclusion , all students may sound a song of summer time and holiday period . &quot;
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ wing operators are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for Il@@ legal Camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for legal camps in Greece , cited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , a group of illeg@@ ally detained people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is running . &quot;
the State Department reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have cont@@ ested the control of the free camping and place each one who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for this purpose . &quot;
controls will continue during the entire season .
the ministry said that the court can depend on a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly will the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; in the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software offers software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emissions of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin by ACE car Club Europe gives evalu@@ ations :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the negotiated software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates above are valid only for vehicles that have mel@@ odic software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the retro@@ fitting has ordered the power station Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced a generous implementation in the coming months , but no exact date is called . &quot;
&quot; Daimler has informed them to write each person concerned . &quot;
&quot; if they be sus@@ cep@@ tible to an inspection , this will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long will the change@@ over cut out in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the connections by the manufacturer and from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , will@@ ingness to act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the re@@ armament itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time consuming to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers who do not drive a car by BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE will wait for the wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is now a massive price comparison of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
&quot; but in the regions , where passengers are dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; in the rural area , there is no value loss for older dies@@ els . &quot;
the ACE will have to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives the Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most common events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony of President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners will not want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives the first Rap@@ per one of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) , and the chore@@ ographer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) , belong to the schol@@ ars . &quot;
the awards will be delivered in early December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will receive a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania on the award . &quot;
the Le@@ ar winner of the Progressive TV series announced that he had already announced to do participation in the Gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New York Times &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she is going to use the conversation with Tr@@ ump , to make its visibility . &quot;
&quot; following the former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De N@@ iro , George Lucas , Tom Han@@ ks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we do the city .
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ d , goes to R@@ ente in the coming year . &quot;
the job is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Urban building has been in place for 31 years .
&quot; and the work still makes it great fun , as he medi@@ ates in the press conference . &quot;
&quot; it reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it mar@@ vel that so far no application is fulfilling the requirement profile . &quot;
&quot; for the next possible time , the city is looking for an architect or building engineer . &quot;
&quot; so , under review of regular dis@@ sent@@ ing periods - be enough time for a preparation . &quot;
&quot; when Has@@ lach acts for the administrative community as a sub@@ e building authority , the applicant must present appropriate closures . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could not fill them any more , the citizen would have to be able to advice up to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the city is near to the city and it even important , W@@ acker who reports from a good operating climate , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city a lon@@ gl@@ asting , &quot; he is sure about the building Office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are located on the agenda : re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower @-@ parking place are pushed . &quot;
the film bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed even the stadium @-@ restoration is still subject .
&quot; the latter is just the latter with some 1.5 million euros to be bu@@ zz@@ ing , &quot; if we make it right , &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; age @-@ up is present for a city master , big playground . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener could be very flexi@@ bly re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move a lot , so w@@ ack@@ ers , and the design of the green plants will be comm@@ end@@ able by citizens and visitors often . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is as a ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye that suits , &quot; if new@@ builds are approved , the separ@@ ating city master is emphas@@ ized . &quot;
the city master we@@ ars high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end it works all about my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on long @-@ term employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing this for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker asks : &quot; we &apos;re looking for someone who really identi@@ fies and want to stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; unless continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the other design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to watch Roland W@@ acker , the city of Has@@ lach should have a degree of university graduates and a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree of expertise in the fields of construction and building planning . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office of the building has high and civil engineering , building planning , grass estate , urban area with building yard and town band@@ men , including monument preser@@ vation , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines closed : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the so far unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track in the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße area ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
&quot; these were so badly damaged , that the her@@ ring freight train had to be stopped . &quot;
investig@@ ators go out of two male gen@@ ders and look for the night hours after them .
near the crime of witnesses a ro@@ sar@@ oter roller and a bike drivers have been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a way of Laus@@ anno@@ ys , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ Speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch for the AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators himself would have resulted in great danger , and also endangered the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the system as well as a late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail traffic , even pel@@ let of rail@@ ways could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; a total of &quot; considerable &quot; sum , &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern route could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , nearly ten people were dropped , two of which were correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight goods dropped out , however , they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation of inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; the un@@ think@@ able condition which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the US , causes stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aches , recur@@ ring or blu@@ kes , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those parties usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of protein found to develop immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes to hide themselves in the meal . &quot;
&quot; cells that are unable to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells , to protect the tolerance and protect the body , without damage to sensitive fabric . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is incl@@ ined towards inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , there was a type of tolerance conveyor cell in mice that carry a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins which trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less ign@@ ant intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us encour@@ ages when the same system is working with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral students in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan under@@ took a kind of immun@@ otherapy when she found out that a group of study powers such cells had such cells , but another group of the same ancest@@ ry , which had not been separated . &quot;
&quot; it suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ al of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice have been DNA sequ@@ enced and there were six bacterial species found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were drawn up in a ster@@ ile environment so that they l@@ acked a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oma and they did not developed this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria are used on the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then resulted in small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - on un@@ ripe immun@@ o@@ cells which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells were developed to toler@@ ate cells .
&quot; when the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid , it proved to be known as a side product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ metabol@@ ites , known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 fatty acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers have doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of cells decreased by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ant cells like mice , and that most of us protect L. Cru@@ ter@@ i in our stomach @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by products from L. Cru@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ical values in the presence of L. Cru@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic .
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria in Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA Cup campaign against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressive in the old role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to do . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed to improve the M@@ our@@ in@@ ho just 45 minutes before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the avi@@ va stadium , as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will begin his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho did not wish to have another new comm@@ ences , but it insi@@ sted that the club had already performed a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of its four new mandatory comm@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing painted &quot; Dream@@ liner to the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began , but in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers on the USA , that are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
&quot; on the radar beams , it was the form of a dre@@ amer . &quot;
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; however , as the wind revol@@ ves around : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD chief , the Prime Minister and Prime Minister continually met with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ ks from the party headquarters , merely no head@@ winds out of the covenant , thus the most important wish of the suff@@ rage . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz has been introducing the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus am constantly watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what has been since the beginning of the year since the beginning of the year , it would not have been described in the approach . &quot;
there were deep strikes .
and one after another .
&quot; following the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German CDU looks a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can &apos;t reg@@ ate reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial department in Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fra@@ ction@@ ing of a Green M@@ EPs have over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months prior to the country code , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party leader Michael Kell@@ ner has ordered the revol@@ ting Sax@@ on Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ akes , to return its mandate . &quot;
the transition to the CDU means a clear dist@@ ortion of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ akes must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Bureau of Citi@@ zens of the Green Party of the Green Party ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , the SPD suff@@ rage , when on Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ message party had reached the party hub . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transition of the green members of El@@ ke T@@ akes to CDU without own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what is next .
the Mis@@ er began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more don &apos;t so@@ othing , so@@ oth@@ es the comra@@ des . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was then - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the deaf , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite hau@@ te the party around . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks , comra@@ des woke up afterwards again in the weeks later . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had turned new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next dive came .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD @-@ Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did in crisis communication after that , quite all that made wrong , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Weil .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ emission aff@@ aires and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Prime Minister has already been a foreign minister in the criticism of the supervisory board . &quot;
mi@@ ese sub@@ fra@@ ct@@ ance were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe for that reason , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to put more power in the Federation of Ak@@ z@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the quest of former Mayor of Mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , was not hid in the context of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
&quot; they sent him , because they spoke about because of that a stabil@@ ising of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; in this case , because of the party internal force , Weil is not guilty . &quot;
and Schulz not at all .
&quot; at times , comra@@ des stri@@ ve to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger appe@@ als to the green , and here mainly on the revol@@ ting par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in T@@ akes . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and co @-@ democracy , such as Mrs. T@@ akes its own career entry over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party ink in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ akes has not been elected to parliament as director of directors , but on the regional list of the Lower Saxony @-@ Green Party . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they withdraw their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ained a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters for four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil &apos;s prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Sax@@ on SPD as a leading can@@ did@@ act to the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal care@@ ers think of a future CDU members to the election outcome , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he asked to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or further adv@@ ances of the CDU Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ iers III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his home in the years , can get support from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of Ste@@ g urban development on Wednesday arrived in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler once again had a look at that before .
since 1991 it has been in Emp@@ fingen restoration areas .
&quot; back then , in the pro@@ curement area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation zone II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler &apos;s previous san@@ itation are a &quot; success subject &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior development , and not only close new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one will receive information from the governing area of Karlsruhe , that it will be a renovation area III . &quot;
&quot; funding amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;
how does a san@@ ction come about ?
&quot; to investigate , Sch@@ in@@ dler continue to investigate where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it is also a role , whether in the planned area of interest , to san@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the area of the area could then post@@ p@@ one another . &quot;
&quot; the j@@ etty appeared on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state @-@ to @-@ program &quot; Social City , &quot; in which frames would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of Inn@@ es , the improvement of residential and employment relations and preser@@ vation of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; measures would be object @-@ related , which means per plot . &quot;
&quot; finally , the rehabilitation area would eventually be established as a stat@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; the approval period for funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however until September of this year , however , it would have been carried out until September of this year , as part of those who received a questionnaire in the renovation area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as possible , the set of pro@@ curement will be started to begin with the San@@ he@@ aters in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to perform the bes@@ po@@ ised pre @-@ trial investigations .
&quot; to evaluate and decide the urban de@@ priv@@ ation of urban@@ ization , and decide when to be rehabil@@ itated and in which circum@@ ference . &quot;
it will then be included in the basic book for the respective land .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again be coming to Emp@@ fingen , and making themselves a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized an essential success factor for the project is the participation of participants .
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and principle of land , &quot; in which it is among other things to build the construction state and the renovation . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made to size , distribution and residents of a residential community . &quot;
the blue &quot; mode of operation &quot; is only filled when building business rooms are operated .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ fill questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
new construction measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding is functioning after the &quot; Wind@@ dog Prin@@ ciple &quot; - who first comes to get ma@@ stered first .
you can no charge of funding for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the present &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; project . &quot;
British inventor himself sets a micro@@ chip in order to come into house and car with a hand@@ ing movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his door , his office and even run his car &apos;s movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ bs and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , in order to ensure that the im@@ plant method is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra cost of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins , when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that fixes the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the military that has been left to the TIM@@ E magazine up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wisconsin and an forkli@@ ft truck was built in Connecticut . &quot;
&quot; the White House office demanded the presence of the helicopter type in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn landed , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for operating the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted to know that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior , deputy naval officer for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at about 15 pm , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; the original airport was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the plane during the time . &quot;
&quot; of the records provided for the TIM@@ E provided that , it was not clear whether a second plane should be necessary . &quot;
&quot; at the Hatch Act , German Parliament is able to use state property for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the event .
&quot; a question that we were asked whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed about that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate , and prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as the Marine One or Air Force One , is not a new phenomenon . &quot;
pre@@ sidents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but their use only require for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential airplane took an investigation before the background of his first batt@@ les@@ hip r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential palace through its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn in order to expos@@ e the US president in the White House with precision met@@ ers@@ sets . &quot;
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 conducted 58 training courses in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event attracted significant expend@@ itu@@ res for the month &apos;s training needs for the month , said an official . &quot;
helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours to that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers did not have the load for any of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man from S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company was not involved in a helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ing drawings for presidential flights and it &apos;s difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the United States Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D will however be 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
recordings of the unit list the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual cost for operating the helicopter can be far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of equi@@ pping sets is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance , and many other hidden costs contained in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a MUS@@ T study from 2015 , the issu@@ ance rates for Do@@ D do not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the costs for fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former Press@@ pre@@ acher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are manufactured in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have ti@@ rel@@ essly worked .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to raise . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump was inter@@ ned with the helicopter , when he entered the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky , and with media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three thereof . &quot;

top @-@ leader of the second tennis league will compete in the S@@ V standings .
the TC @-@ White Ne@@ uss come on tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the age of the third Su@@ ff@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite having five games , mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has received the sense of reality . &quot;
team chief Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect respect to the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
right on the back positions I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ gar dor@@ fer S@@ V , mainly imports from the high north . &quot;
their Danish and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ör@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult for us , as always . &quot;
you also need a good portion . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give maxim@@ e Jan@@ 4 .
&quot; at the moment , at the moment the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active French@@ man does not make the Bundesliga game , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) occurs during his first use in this season . &quot;
&quot; so far , Chil@@ ene Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ sen An@@ drei Vas@@ il@@ ev@@ ski , at the ATP tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el at the ATP tournament . &quot;
&quot; he should be as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ru@@ p , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also come back into the team . &quot;

back@@ wards : the city presents 46 kitchen plans
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed response partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the urban nursery venues , the clock will be turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the supply of food supplies in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; we are all pleased with us . &quot;
&quot; cooked to the house : a Cater@@ pillar takes over this task , delivering fresh boiled co@@ ols . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the centre of 46 children &apos;s day , in 44 the children have a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is steadily growing . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile there are not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days in the K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in 35 @-@ hour supervision if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 participants from the 1st of September kitchen service : you will warm the fishing food , add it to salad , raw vegetables and fruits , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , clean the food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seventh @-@ tro@@ op facilities - decides about the hour@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen help belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance is happy . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier for day@@ makers to implement ped@@ agog@@ ical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
the children should help to prepare meals .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
even for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the acid rooms of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the job of the ch@@ and@@ el@@ ens - is completed in future of special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - beside the quality improvement of the kitchen performance even the charm , which she exhibited in the cost between property management and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , even though 46 part @-@ time forces will be re@@ hired . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the educational sector not so strong into the weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative , if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the Chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , author of the United Nations &apos;s Mission , said that hundreds of women are elected to the provinces in the provinces . three women are elected vice @-@ president for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can be only really representative and belie@@ vable if women are unable to participate in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban issued threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international mar@@ tial arts to an advisory role . &quot;
this year the elections for the first time will be peac@@ efully transferred by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time .
&quot; Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot;
the Afghan Independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

&quot; according to the information of the police , the men said the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who continued with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , against 14.@@ 55 hrs because they wanted to call with the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;

G@@ MB concern on investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to take up a union with managers of the Bis@@ c@@ ite @-@ producer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie about the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company has held the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which offers Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea cookies in addition to other products . &quot;
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ i said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would be &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s guidance of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s to express their concerns , that the financing for the modernis@@ ing of production lines will not be advanced . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win any clarity over business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross , affects our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the labour forces focus on the local community and the large region of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social charity . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and before the back@@ drop of the Bre@@ xit , the rising civil costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urg@@ ently urg@@ ently need a floral production presence at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman from Pla@@ i said : &quot; the Fili@@ al@@ head at Toll@@ cross only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to it , since we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , with which some questions openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are working in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business continuously review - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to stay competitive . &quot;
&quot; it added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our favorite cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of Toll@@ cross as a production facility and all of them . should change our operations at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned about three years before Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the site of La Liga may be their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t be re@@ acted in their persecution of Ne@@ y@@ mar , after placing an offer of £ 189 million in order to dissolve his free@@ wheel clause , but have warned Barcelona in front of three years before the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has moved the Trans@@ fer@@ window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the past season to Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ y@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way , as Ne@@ y@@ mar insi@@ sted on its way to outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans pre@@ dicts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned about three years ago by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents before this prospec@@ t ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 are interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they don &apos;t touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that it could not allow it to travel to Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price offers for Ne@@ y@@ mar . &quot;
roller Con@@ stru@@ t and damaged
&quot; on Saturday night from Friday to Saturday , a well @-@ known perpet@@ r@@ ator has been deliberately thrown into the royal fields before the estate number 30 , and caused by the vehicle &apos;s cl@@ adding of more than 200 euros . &quot;

on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ ade report by Pope @-@ Brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was dischar@@ ged by the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report of the scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; explained from the former Reg@@ ens@@ burg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Emer@@ itus Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church to serve out if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would make their deep regret about their own under@@ lines or their then wrong assessment of the processes .
&quot; however , the Vatican Chancellor , &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that there was a two @-@ level measure when reporting on violence on violence . &quot;
&quot; regarding the gri@@ ps in Regensburg no one knows that it would have to prevent &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds &quot; , &quot; but the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian , and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the acc@@ u@@ stom@@ age to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it for normal , &quot; says Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; we would like to go on the church and this is a second fres@@ her . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they pointed out that in their youth &quot; stro@@ kes was a quite normal educational means &quot; to be ready to be done with friends , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would like to turn it un@@ fair , today &apos;s setting standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the mis@@ use cases , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , translated into 12 languages ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 shel@@ ters from 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , &quot; with high pl@@ au@@ sibility &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; summar@@ ize , so that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
&quot; even at high e@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also stum@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims fall in the general crimes of R. , and in many cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion was dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; inci@@ dents of Viol@@ ent Practice &quot; &quot; is a contra@@ dict@@ ory picture by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
for one raise many students his &quot; humanity . &quot;
&quot; for the other , it also appears as a Chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ect@@ ant who became the more frag@@ ile if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz was not a top performance . &quot;
how do you analyze this final report as its bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you should rather ask , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all . &quot;
&quot; to him , 8 pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ - or co @-@ knowledge of the terrible cases sexual abuse . &quot;
the violent ex@@ cess@@ es at the pre@@ school took place outside of its effectiveness .
&quot; it is possible to give it any case , learn it too late or did not take the first impression seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , on which he worked , was expressed by practically all those surveyed than - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as well , the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also represents an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , &quot; &quot; compet@@ ently , &quot; &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; kno@@ wle@@ d@@ ful &quot; , &quot; &quot; competent , &quot; and &quot; always provided by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is concerned about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high e@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , which also led to che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; he did not only die with chairs and cast the key@@ ring on the ground , but also ear@@ thly boys in the hair or ears , he already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his sentence , however , we have to say that such educational methods in the fra@@ c@@ ely time , the 1960s and 1970s were widely used , with parents like in teachers . &quot;
do you still know such bre@@ eders methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world school , a state schools . &quot;
&quot; compared to what actually is in this report , namely , the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and non@@ violence on the pre@@ school , are fre@@ est@@ ingly bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; it is already wonder@@ ing , whether it &apos;s not more likely to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just moved on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian Pope , many who never have understood it , still eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ es Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the context of the report , there was a lot about the topic of abuse during the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also added any transaction or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very much no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a one @-@ one representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the true problem in education of sexual abuse was , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they don &apos;t even have parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Schüler R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ er student form@@ ulated this way : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have had known his guidance ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have been able to stop their perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected ... Bu@@ ying int@@ ru@@ sive , or clear@@ er , or rather opened , as compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ants , tru@@ sts etc . &quot;
that you speak with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report on the very clear result : &quot; that in the course of the only affected students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , George R@@ atz@@ inger is free of charge from each fellow . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradi@@ cted crime , as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
in the media there was a lot of &quot; non@@ violence &quot; to read the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; the previous Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of having responded to the &quot; &quot; way@@ man &quot; report . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the great problem , that in the reporting everything was mixed and promised to a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but exactly that is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is clean separated from the pre@@ school and school of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as we say , rest . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases , in which child of sa@@ ist@@ ical teachers have been insul@@ ted and mal@@ nourished , took place on the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ in@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to have . &quot;
&quot; but with them Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; it was on that , like most witnesses , the theme &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; conditions .
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann , there was a discipline there , but no sa@@ ist@@ ical force . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of the general crimes of humanity are affected , and thus in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains , to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger shut up the ears consistently in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ y@@ mn@@ asium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this point he insi@@ sts to this , &quot; that in the pre@@ school , the test was still pract@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative press release , he received urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone knows about us . &quot;
there was also hard to estimate where the affected might have been exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed and where really the allow@@ able border had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he would always have taken away .
that &apos;s just not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed that it was un@@ fair to apply the current ped@@ agog@@ ical standards on the then time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ck des An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger to evaluate the past after today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
&quot; but this does not mean , of course , not for sexual abuse , which was ab@@ ins@@ ed at all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s affairs , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; all this is aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it is finally finished . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means for discipl@@ in@@ ating and punishment , so ear@@ ache and ears to move , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment then , he has also been strictly prohibited . &quot;
&quot; what is the picture of his rainy days , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given you again for the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
was the subject of test into language too ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , tells of his perspective , the cathedral spar@@ rows only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in no way , I knew no means that he led there a str@@ ingent Regiment . &quot;
&quot; but this must be said once again : without this perfection , without the entry un@@ conditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form a national cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone one makes no major singer and stand before every success , right on which territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; as what kind of people , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger experienced during talks with their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I learned to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger and experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , li@@ vel@@ i@@ ous , low @-@ belie@@ ver and heart @-@ good people , from which one could not imagine that he could not do a fly somewhat . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still get to him today , 23 years after his Emer@@ gency , regularly contact him - he is nearly blind - and he is treated like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him today , so that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ ades are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has been close to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , v@@ ati@@ cal teacher - a stri@@ cter father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respec@@ tful teacher , to whom they still look up and honour her . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that one thro@@ ws him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently promin@@ ently and a more prominent brother has to do to the media . &quot;
&quot; the evil intention is that behind it , just too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which was just released , was dischar@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; now the connection was to be purchased , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would have gotten himself great mer@@ its , and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ estic spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot;
