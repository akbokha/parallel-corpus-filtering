<seg id="1">"Munich, 1856: four cards that change your eyes to the city"</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstage where young people are to meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a Gruftkapelle, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardener generate the current reason for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories on days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is nervous when playing cards are not currently present.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that had to be exciting for the car because the car-Navi had a green meadow.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are all others more than currently - but therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, the cities and municipalities in the area of Munich has changed since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a Flickenteppich that is not the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the large oversight card, tickets for cities and municipalities in more detailed maps, so-called urine leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these originated after the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864, and jump on the first surveying of Bayerns."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the spring of 1800, the French armies occupied since spring 1800 during the second coalition of war with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Napoleon, Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic photo of Bavaria in order - of course to military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops seized the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbors, which created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thereby the Bavarian State Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the jungle sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the country's capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is subduling, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after creation of the map, i.e. 1877, in the Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of subsiders are concentrated in 1856 along today's plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is, there is nothing more than fields - at first glance: when in zooming, a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written bottle pieces from the so-called" Urals "from which the fundamental tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"there are no farmers in the countryside today, but small gardener in the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, in the 19th century, had actually a meadow, and there was no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the jungle table one reads only the street name" "Au-Haidhausen, not only the street names" "at the inn" "or at the bottom" "At the ventilation" - but also in great letters "Irren Anstalt." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here, at the Auerfield road, people once unlocked people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle Irrenaissance 'was created on the Auer ventilation.</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudder directed the establishment of the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the anchains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has instructed the staff to apply violence against the occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, director of the Museum Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients, first place was first, and it was extended to 500 places later."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some time this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrament in hair in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrist in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet young people at the Munich Salesianum in the area of former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order received the building complex in 1920, and went into a youth home with education."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "built in architectural rejection to the origin of the Irrenaissance, which was destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as the "main place" and the department of merchants called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War even in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 a lot of holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">One big remained until today - by Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, Small Business Houses and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once more to the Marienhof, where this day will take place for the second S-Bahn station on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider slider, the old Munich map will be compared with the air image of today - and fill the hole on Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Union to promote Farms has issued a warning for colored people who are based on the discriminating politics and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which should come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians, as a number of fragfying, racial-based accidents in recent times in the entire state, and here is to be noted here."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people heavier to gain discrimination against discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, aimed to release the dissenting group, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, the people pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"due to their skin color, they are beaten and killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such an incidence which we have not heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning to exhibit the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents as racist fighting against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questioning circumstances in the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the journey through the state of Missouri in custody, without being accused of crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also refers to a recently published report of the Office of the Office of Missouri, in which black motorists will be able to keep 75 percent more common in the state."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and their families, friends and employees informed about what could happen in Missouri," said chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People must be willing to bring it on the money or relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in the year 2015, according to the latest numbers from the FBI's report program, which had the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for home or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the United States have passed immigration authorities to suspend people because of immigration disorders, which will contribute to the ACLU's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="66">"itwarnings are normally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to other countries, but at the last time stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary.</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisheracher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestagsled Peter White and Kordula Kovac were given a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">The Schwendemann family members met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs in the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insights into its operation, in which it supplies 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as well as many young cattle and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black-milk "is responsible for him the ageing process of the milk of its cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the cottages are exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV-President of Fisherald, he described the" elemental project "as" elemental project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't accumulate on derart steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green surface care for much work, much must be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and worked on this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not have a bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, the Commune was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the funding promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at costs between 3000 and 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope, that the point of view of the surfaces could go out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, the people who work in agriculture and thoughts on how they continue their operation," emphasised the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often seen in criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the revealing surface amounts to 40 hectares, which must not be applied until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"half of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter carried out the Fiscal community."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers were donated to 12 610 euros, that they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers of the fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you are doing a really good job, without farmers and fellow women do not go. "</seg>
<seg id="90">Also available for Peter White: "best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state of councils (lpr) Baden-Württemberg is possible to support the state funding of Weidefences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr recorded funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the fence can not be harmed by the fence. (hangar above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the armor."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fiscal Comming Project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, which are located just under 16 kilometers of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the covering space corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost of more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty now.</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime change is, if they begin to attack the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate these as every other, so the sorbet of Saddam Hussein staged on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, didn't know what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the proposals for the drastic limitation of legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller won't handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty-Imiters would have wished to do it if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it touches its importance, and especially the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument."</seg>
<seg id="105">"when Miller Acosta passed:" I don't want to go to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty... an icon of American freedom which lightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer later, was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correct, but how he formulated it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the elaborate words of Lazarus, the only one where a state did not only invite any old immigrants, but the arms of the poor:" your potters, your poor, and yours inpressing masses that yearns to breathe freely, the elent waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elating trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller does not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural argument: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who tried to place their words after her death on the base - did not know that it has been made a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans in creating a classical picture showing the female embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem is the female figure no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she herself is a different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the meaning of the statue changed, people wanted to change them from the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great scream Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was that the American flame is going into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch shall not lighten the way into the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they were seen from the exhausted, but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys at the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is about to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and improve a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"her statue speaks to them the words of hope, and of welcome you must hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is of course not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever wish to recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not shine the way, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black is the Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle reminds himself of a time when only two villus belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of world championship lead" will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "something special has developed in Scotland" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand, and we will continue, until we'll find out," "Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy from the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butcher - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was elected team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her chapter speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or practice, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"passion and real feeling, the emotion of natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth-Silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships for the 400-m hurdle, says that" "unbelievable" "that 16 Scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">"last year, the middle distances of Muir leads five British and two European records last year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle reminds himself of their first world championships when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "on the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only the team, but in some cases also at the medals and for the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about team captains is in the fact that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose me, makes it something very special for me," "added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to Powers."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think they went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it's really important to set on this home support and benefit that we are again in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and there's just a great atmosphere there out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not apply to a public office if you cannot bear the heating of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspaper struck him because of everything, from the inner policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he was immined with criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics into silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, dumb, and mute, as sheep for the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"after Maryland Joogan, this brings me to Maryland Joogan who needs to work more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans employees have blocked contributions of at least 450 people, and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained him about this week in the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governors of the Governor dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online comment was filled with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when there is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor, in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">It has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters, and to use his haemless head to chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, blocking of people who come on the page of the Governors - which is a public forum, which is considered officially called and by employees who are paid by public tax-Dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post joined Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hammers, which swaying online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The Post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and they are only real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they said they said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">"the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith."</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hassfully, but she asked for Hasselt."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the news release "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people became the same subject, they are used by some more than a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governors of the Governors as" concentrated Spam attack "would call other likely" intercession "." "</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut out, simply by simply blocking a critic or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous times, when one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical ladders and to burn or kill protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is just happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials saying that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is proclaim by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>

<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable Portos had similar effects like the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters struck down on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even at that time, Washington had anonyme."</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola "," Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "wrote all letters of newspapers, which make Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitioning that critically criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banknote with passion for real estate, resized in 2014 by a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something that was comparable to my prize.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I loved in love, and made an offer on that day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a single room estate with a filler layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to use Joanne storage room and a mezzanine to optimise the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she instructed the architects and designer Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill that was to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not just a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms to place each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"to be creative, Erfan had to be creative to release the submission."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel structure is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on each other, without having to gaps ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about to build a simple platform, but put the steel that he had the right height above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled it to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine has a classic copper light window of Retrouvius across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short Corridor is mirrored on both ends to make it longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen you feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units for all the corner and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous noise, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if they are not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Hinged kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineers went in," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is always important, so if you push the door high, very easily glides."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agents will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to enlarge the floor space, and use high-quality materials that make its own luxury advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be turned out by good design and increased income of slightly standard in something completely.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Trump - including reports of the news media, hoping to hold the boss on a uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met his first working day with conductive employees, he set up a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: bad news that goes into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or mailings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"waitory diagnosis makes sense, but others have attempted to tame drump by supervising his media monitoring."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship for television goes back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, its television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if there was a candidate of Trump because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of jobs that were convinced that he said to the former election campaign Sam Nunberg in February, compared to the POLITICO."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" "the key, trumps Twitter habit consists of control to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter needs ever" under control, "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these fighters official know something that we do not know others - that Trumps tweets have even contain more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never find something about tweets who did not send trump.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his employees made it a few times, his troubles came away from him, then their effort was worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently prevent, that Trump controversy emerged."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem exists, that people in a white house, together to present themselves out of competing parties, attempts to present their own agenda by promoting trump material, possibly promoting their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - busy with this history - reported in May about the preference of advisors to bring the presidents of strategic reasons for doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump as a volcano can react to negative press clips, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he might find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February, when somebody accused the president of malicious writing a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the vice-president of Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banished because of Schikans permanently from Twitter, or that he has no specific evidence, or that he expressed false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask employees of Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump of paper."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still under influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">This unchangeable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1488">"a couple of weeks ago, the Washington Post, wrote that the Sonderator Trump personally moved to the center and seek the allegations to hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair may hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand Jurys is to consider evidence of evidence and decide if the prosecution is to be charged."</seg>

<seg id="1816">"drugs are drug gglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there are no rest of violence in the country, and throughout the country the bodies are more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto continued to join in December 2012, and now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter you are editor and her Inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to be living in Mexico and to be a journalist," he wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is perceived deeply, although his presence is present everywhere - a great photo of Valdez, that shows his middle finger with the word" Justice, "put on the facade of the Rioce building. two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-shirts, who show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamark."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Special Representative of the Federal Office was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, this was initiated only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders each year associated with drug trafficking and organisational crimes, the murderers of journalists are rarely challenged."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intra-east and although the terrain is now avengined."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not the Why, we suspend everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he made it only to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was shot by two men. he was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - who is translated with" "12th River". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Schütze drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans was arrested last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the country's bloodiest battlefields to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of embellished, two-story mouse to drugs that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" peace "," if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes in the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rivaling cartel fractions in war with Guzmans sons were announced in February."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have offended the children, suspected Ganges bought every copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was in this, Valdez not to force her, after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story, the country to its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues received that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined the founding of Rioce with five colleagues and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism, without encounter the riddle dashore, "Bojorquez said."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest coverage, and the turnover and the advertisement took."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard treading investigations without fear of censorship, and the reader were fascinated by a publication that they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Rioce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot-Award "for their reporting in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect Journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever she led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave himself up that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue," "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," said he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take the task to help you as a journalist - either you or you're playing the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I would not want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team missed Valdez, the Spaak bird, who was able to curse the Spaak, the generous with hugs and ratchet, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar over the office, go there and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his calamity?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death, too, forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and staying alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret start and runways, to tackle drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," Bojorquez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-aging and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instances.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, lead it away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no longer - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrratives smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>

<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Rioce met for security training, suddenly no cell phones was allowed. days earlier, Spyware that is exclusively sold to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">There were two police protection from the heat of 104 degrees outside the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-class building in Culiacan area of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter went into the mountain landscape, where the drug abuse are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Rioce has bent on three main layers."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of the brother's brother Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, which focused on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that was placed in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who has been kidnapped or as it was done, so it was given to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politicians, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), who ruled almost all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of high-carcases of corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this eating house, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman was sent to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the reader discovered the column of Valdez than the best informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its streamlined body style. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the Office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who protested against the murders of journalists, dedicated to something that they had never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter Miriam Ramirez made a few signs and went to a demonstration on the next morning to a demonstration, due to another journalist to the office of the public."</seg>

<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"with a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to piping out journalists and to bring them to the truth, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked that she is again divided by the government, because she is concerned that their anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organizational crime, involved with government officials and an equal society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book," Narco-Journalism "wrote that reporter did not only be killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the red plant-carnivorser is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Radio, when he died on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"discovered by him, Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology."</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you have blinking only a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it was slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to see. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, the mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant carnivores, although it is covered with a armour and resembles a wandelant tank, probably threatened by flesh-nivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily patched dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide in front of prey, and used a parachuting technique that is used as counter-dictation, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings, and to revert to its enemies, experts say what it suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have studied the wild animal and studied Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell called, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours, it carefully worked carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of sheds and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter, a widespread defense method in the animal rich, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than their underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the console is usual, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds the size of the living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur of enough pressure was hunted by flesh-nivorous dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation was favourable as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of contemporary animals that use the shakes - think of deer, zebras, or girdles - are much smaller and violate as a prey, that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behaviour on a massive, strong chunchy dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs rob of the Cretaceous must have been" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scals also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs is rotted.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his preserved Darkhaltes, to figure out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, pushed into a river and pushed into the sea, where he fell on the back to the ocean floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm like South florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it remains fully covered with preserved skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of animal reserves" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as in the early crayon.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if only a little with the eyes of Schielen, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived some millions years after Borealopelta, the panzery dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furious ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose newest knowledge appear in current biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Radio, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved-preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armour, and is completely from muzzle to hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the pandefied plant carnivores was pushed through the Western Canada, to a flooded river in the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs keep his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remains of this special specimen are so well preserved, that the skin rating still cover holprige armrests along the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko, written for National Geographic, is such a level of conservation as' rare as a profit in lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it will be."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Frozen remnants of the skin cover still the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="2034">"this is not common," Ferrell remembered its testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, to which we have accustomed to us, and which we can call it."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivering.</seg>

<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23: 00, she repeated her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? ""</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, of strength and resistance that consists of the point of people living in community life and have filled the streets to ask answers."</seg>

<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she reminded her what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police has killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not correct."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not bring her away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">"what is happening today, is a highlight of what happened in the past."</seg>
<seg id="2047">It has to know and see it and tucked up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution, and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have lucky enough to give her an experience in which she was personally experienced racism, it is not different than the next black women."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel it, I would prove it a bad service to keep them far from far."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, found himself at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police agency that was awaiting a Camparea when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter have joined with a local business partner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"they prepared bags, and helped them to pass through protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism on Ferrell form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed after August 9, she said and notices that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Folaah's evening demonstration, one of the film co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to document" document "," what happened. "</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came about Ferrell in the sense:" do you want to be documenting or tries to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often benefited from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently said in an interview:" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for its activism."</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell the project closer together with six other local people followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks to us." we speak, ""</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me as these people are represented, for so I will be presented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the aim was to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but around a community that comes together," said folayan - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves and marry her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that this work must be certain in this work, and in the realisation of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells's history repeats the role of black-gay women in the broader Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, which had marked the film" BlacklivesMatter "in 2012, identifies the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identified himself as a gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried out the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting in different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"however, Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insisted that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's not a coincidence, although it was at the front front, because in a life at these cruises as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense its energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the rattitudes between the municipality and the police continue to remain."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she kles herself to a vocals and she feels obliged to this memory, since they went into Ferguson in three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "magnitude": TV reader discuss about bits gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves people, although it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the swending of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation in 2009 has become the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the topic hardly one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The theme is also discussed at our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to say to the Bit Gallery:" it would be a dream "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side, "" does not need a man "" (Siggi Bing) or completely simple: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates build that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which other businesses are profiting, fear the opponents, that then the pedestrian precingement."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery will be planned on the grounds on which the farm market stands in which 13 constituents traded their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of construction, it will conclude with that."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-Macher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Beda square with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we've been buying almost every week in the farm market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landwomen always enjoy very much."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's butcher have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that during and especially after the construction of the gallery, there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of rent. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, this is probably not low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping spreader in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drilled or supermarkets: I find the superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"one sees how many shops are empty here, some have been here for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"however, since it is not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important that at least the Markthalle remains at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is obtruely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, shop transactions are rented in a shopping center only by larger firms, because the Mixed Miets are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops, there are almost no more and what else is left, will disappear as well."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle fit for me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery will not fit Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the peasant Hall during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even in duration if the Bit Gallery is actually coming out sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already create a bit-gallery beforehand to distribute all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not functioning.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a farmer markthalle it's thanks to the madly many - how I find - sensual building projects in Bitburg has no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall is capitated, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost unnoticeable, which hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tubes and hair sections created by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the cuttings out of the prison Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service provider had served a 35-year sentence after they publicly put diplomatic news on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"it is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline did their expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, who was transferred to Barack Obama as he only had three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could be created by Manning and from the 30 portraits have been created, a sharp comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has been openly spoken of identification as a woman since their puberty, was condemned in 2013 because of 20 accusations, including six violations of the spy law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a grainy, black-white Selfie, in which Manning sits idle in a driver's seat and has been associated with her."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"it produced the artist's portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette strolling and chewing gum, in order to extract the DNA from the waste, in order to produce a picture of which people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," said Dewey-Hagborg on a press show of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were forced to unequal letters that exerted several letters in the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one by Shoili Kanungo Illustrierte comic," Suppressed Images, "which was predicted to convert a future in which the president would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in fact, Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Mannings release his release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, a welcome type of happenings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little deep and Starkes, as Donald Trump leads a war against informant from government-camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweeter splits, which he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey Hagborg asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things are going to happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of Galerie's artistic statement, Manning called for her overbig signature among them (the" i "in their family name) an end of the" automatic crushing, whose foundation sex, race, sexuality and culture have been. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As is written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how surprising, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what humans are hopefully going to take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell us so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a site from the mentioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"it shows Manning, as it emerges with a hands-lance holder in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your words, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist that greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I'm still going to see when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition yet personally - as it was supposed to be taken out in the comic book - but if she should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room of masks, from their own genomic simulation that leads to their own genomic simulation."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also aimed at all, as all in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), which were written with their genetic haport groups with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a human being," said Dewey Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed itself with Chelsea, as the movement that burned down behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its form of nipple, and type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"the people make themselves funny about it, but the company deliver every amount of it, and we will see it much more frequently to see," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicon scalp which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that can be achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also customize its robots to" "customize" "and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of nipples up to the type or colour of his finger nails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will still be troubled, because many robots own" personalities "who would like a stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots with a silicon scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, allows users to adjust their robots to the properties which they are appealing as for example."</seg>

<seg id="2406">"there are many bewildly aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlined female properties, receding at Frigid (means: residenial) Farrah, unquiet one at most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men have no Roxxxy then?" it is on the site. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing refinement show a bit darker and deep in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality in an option to having sex with subconformity as an optional allowance."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men are of course not having sex robots, and while FRR remembers their rising popularity, they still remain temporary on the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leak out of the boundary zones, can be in regards to the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>

<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlapping that this highly developed sex robot in a time scuba diving in which the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a presidents in the White House to have attacked women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the bondwoman ') are not the graphic images, the swallowed body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robots exists, a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want it to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, at the point, when it comes to their" personalities, the robots do not represent real women. "</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot be separated from their companion or just go away.</seg>

<seg id="2586">"when the balance is inclined towards inflammation, it may result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, there was a type of tolerance conveyor cell in mice that carry a particular bacterium in its initiate."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins which trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had their immune cells."</seg>

<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice have been DNA sequenced and there were six bacterial species found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were drawn up in a sterile environment so that they lacked a intestinal microbioma and they did not developed this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria are used on the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then resulted in small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - on unripe immunocells which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells were developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component has been cleaned out of the fluid, it proved to be known as a side product of tryptophan-metabolites, known as Indol-3 fatty acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers have doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of cells decreased by about 50 percent, but if the tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerant cells like mice, and that most of us protect L. Cruteri in our stomach-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-by products from L. Cruteri develop cells in humans as in mice, but defects in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "the development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote, since these cells are inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>

<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American building programmes."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"in addition to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and an forklift truck was built in Connecticut."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you are locked," answered the Deputy Commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave a violation of reform of health reform that was underway in the Senate, and propagated the efforts to constrain government regulations."</seg>

<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 shelters from 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s," with high plausibility "victims of overprint, 67 Domspatzen were sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger who was working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" summarize, so that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were applied. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even at high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also stumble."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims fall in the general crimes of R., and in many cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion was discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "incidents of Violent Practice" "is a contradictory picture by Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one raise many students his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, it also appears as a Choleriker and Perfectant who became the more fragile if a Domspatz was not a top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report as its biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you read the effort and reads the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you should rather ask, why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"to him, 8 pages are dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the mid- or co-knowledge of the terrible cases sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The violent excesses at the preschool took place outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to give it any case, learn it too late or did not take the first impression seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was expressed by practically all those surveyed than -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"as well, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also represents an excellent testimony," "honestly," "competently," "knowledful", "" knowledful "," "knowledful", "" knowledful "," "knowledful", "" competent, "and" always provided by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is concerned about his perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only die with chairs and cast the keyring on the ground, but also earthly boys in the hair or ears, he already regretted, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his sentence, however, we have to say that such educational methods in the fracely time, the 1960s and 1970s were widely used, with parents like in teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeders methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a world school, a state schools."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what actually is in this report, namely, the horrific sexual abuse and nonviolence on the preschool, are freestingly bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is already wondering, whether it's not more likely to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just moved on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian Pope, many who never have understood it, still eagerly awaited."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relies Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the context of the report, there was a lot about the topic of abuse during the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also added any transaction or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very much no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "said a one-one representative for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true problem in education of sexual abuse was, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they don't even have parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questioner student formulated this way: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have had known his guidance (Georg Ratzinger) and could have been able to stop their perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that it is expected... Buying intrusive, or clearer, or rather opened, as compared to their parents, internatants, trusts etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report on the very clear result:" that in the course of the only affected students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, George Ratzinger is free of charge from each fellow."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having taken him or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradicted crime, as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media there was a lot of "nonviolence" to read the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the previous Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of having responded to the" "wayman" report. ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the great problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and promised to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But exactly that is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clean separated from the preschool and school of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as we say, rest."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases, in which child of saistical teachers have been insulted and malnourished, took place on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skinandalous conditions have to have."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"it was on that, like most witnesses, the theme" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann, there was a discipline there, but no saistical force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims of the general crimes of humanity are affected, and thus in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains, to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods of time in which it was reported by the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) wanted nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger shut up the ears consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this point he insists to this," that in the preschool, the test was still practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative press release, he received urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey zone, as everyone knows about us."</seg>
<seg id="2968">There was also hard to estimate where the affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where really the allowable border had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he would always have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That's just not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards on the then time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about" Fallacck des Anachronism, "so the danger to evaluate the past after today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this does not mean, of course, not for sexual abuse, which was abinsed at all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's affairs, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"all this is awful, and I am glad that it is finally finished."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means for disciplinating and punishment, so earache and ears to move, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment then, he has also been strictly prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what is the picture of his rainy days, Georg Ratzinger has given you again for the talks with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of test into language too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective, the cathedral sparrows only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, in no way, I knew no means that he led there a stringent Regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this must be said once again: without this perfection, without the entry unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form a national cultural ambassador in Europe and his musical tradition which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and Bonbons alone one makes no major singer and stand before every success, right on which territory, but always discipline, passion and self-exaggerated."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as what kind of people, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger experienced during talks with their book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I learned to know Georg Ratzinger and experienced a wonderful, humorous, livelious, low-believer and heart-good people, from which one could not imagine that he could not do a fly somewhat."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen still get to him today, 23 years after his Emergency, regularly contact him - he is nearly blind - and he is treated like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him today, so that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspades are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has been close to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, vatical teacher - a stricter father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful teacher, to whom they still look up and honour her."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that one throws him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently prominently and a more prominent brother has to do to the media."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intention is that behind it, just too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just released, was discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the connection was to be purchased, a 93-year-old man who would have gotten himself great merits, and without the outside of Bavaria and maybe even Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domestic sparrows, finally in peace."</seg>
