Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
&quot; in an interview , the Hollywood star has now made a clear statement . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the pil@@ es of pil@@ es
his experiences on the horse are gru@@ es@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with a ride on the beach . &quot;
&quot; for the 58 @-@ year old , it was a premiere . &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hunt for food in the fast g@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I &apos;m afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended up again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he had left his family with his family on the property of the AL@@ RV , to a horse he did not swim for photo purposes . &quot;
the first time in Aachen was the first time in Aachen .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid presented the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala to the Golden Sport pyramid .
&quot; in awards , we lack the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men . &quot;
&quot; Federal Chancell@@ ery , silver nes bay leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th winner of the pil@@ es pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this distinction is very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it will not only be awarded for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also included the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 additional outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ times US ma@@ ers@@ lau@@ er was included in the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ enger , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the Spr@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the designer Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports events were come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society emigrated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion where the Lav@@ az@@ za prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; the two U.S. presidential candidates , however , are un@@ question@@ ably in the tax and energy policy , as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a basic , more philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
&quot; the , about the role of the state . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small , and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with tax and reg@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to spread the economy to death and regulate to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; it himself would be very different , claimed Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return reg@@ gae massi@@ vely , and he makes himself strong for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says , the state has certain tasks to open , he has got to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the wealthy would be increased , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the needs to be invested , tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost like the same . &quot;
the Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected about the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump , you could still agree to the internal discussions . &quot;
more clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and the coal transport in the USA .
oil production should also be possible in protected areas to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement as well .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy investment and calls for : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transport @-@ fish trade agreement , don &apos;t want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both don &apos;t want to is@@ olate the United States from international trade - just better to protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to be paid even better , for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what if Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t want to do this question is not quite clear : once he says , the minimum wage has to be r@@ ushed , then he says , he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to re@@ load the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him before , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton says at least of the rich who wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone to almost everyday life .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby which is at most one year old .
one has laid her little son in his arms .
he looked at very curious in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ ed on a table @-@ top .
until she not@@ ices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the area of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria , and among other things , on the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ dged .
&quot; they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all@@ uring women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
un@@ long it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - either as visitors .
the exception is a watch@@ man in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated : every woman who comes here has made her escape from sexual violence , says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars , because they are prosec@@ uted because of torture or death , or because their families will send them as hop@@ e@@ as to Europe , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
&quot; in women , there were other reasons for the escape : &quot; many are going to steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced mar@@ riages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; for example , for example , for a bottle of water a sexual action call for a bottle of water is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they come in Germany , rec@@ ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , single @-@ single women would often be regarded as minor and worst in refugees . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women live in the north of Munich , traum@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women have been so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; often they often don &apos;t help to help , I need more accommodations for them , calls for B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they were w@@ alled by a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accomod@@ ations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women are not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press release of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , lower and middle fran@@ ken , there are several common floors or private homes only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women are accommod@@ ated , men and women are accommod@@ ated , it can come to - for@@ ce@@ ability - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all the rooms should be easily accessible , and for women easily , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; as much to feel the women of this protection needs , one can read on And@@ al@@ esen , which there is in Munich &apos;s house . &quot;
&quot; since I talked about it has been around for us , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could make a second house easily .
assistance doctors : recei@@ v@@ ables according to new working measures
&quot; deputy , assistant representatives of the assistance doctors have called their union to appro@@ ve new workers in dispute relating to a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council from the beginning of September more working measures .
J@@ DC said that there had been ministers saying to worry about the agreement on the contract .
&quot; in July , assistant doctors and medical students have agreed upon the re@@ jection of a contract that was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
it was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday night , the chair@@ woman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; be@@ har@@ r@@ ably calm &quot; on problems , what led the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC board voted to completely reject the proposed new contract , and calls for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today asked a formal application for a specific meeting of the BM@@ A Council to start a running program of escal@@ ating employment , which starts at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the disp@@ utes led to this year , assist@@ enti@@ sts seized this year , the first overall fail@@ ures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; according to the vote of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana re@@ signed according to the agreed contract conditions which had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings who took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical surg@@ ents , with that the contract should be advant@@ ageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Ministry of Health , Jeremy Hunt said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be initiated . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of outer sides &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended up a crisis .
&quot; on Tuesday , the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and an official end of the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception I cannot claim that Ankara wants to destroy this reconciliation .
&quot; there was the tor@@ ch , yes . &quot;
but Putin &apos;s smile was nar@@ ro@@ uted and he has hardly felt warmth in itself for his rest@@ rained conditions .
&quot; Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke to his &quot; dear friend , &quot; Putin - according to a report about five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved so would never happen . &quot;
&quot; for me , his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable ha@@ ils showed that the state of state of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ ded .
&quot; Putin divided and accused Ankara , fell into the back in the back . &quot;
&quot; this was even bigger , as it was celebrated by a ver@@ itable friend . &quot;
&quot; building the trig@@ gering , it becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the government controlled media controlled a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once upon a time , the Turks would bear the Turks for everything . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ations of senior officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the territories of Syria , which will be controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the exc@@ use of the President of Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is on the first line all friends who can get when he failed to un@@ cover a coup d &apos;@@ etat that had failed last month .
terror attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economical moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the amount is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights will be resumed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attraction to the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the national television is forecast for fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists take long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it was the response to the tried power of power as a weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ pi@@ ke to draw attention from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state of state won a bonus for sure that he called for the attempted coup &quot; é@@ tat support for the chosen public organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a self @-@ understand@@ able that even a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it to Russia and Turkey , as described as an analytical once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of Foreign lateral &quot; &quot; : two countries that over@@ took off from the West and are badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support both sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of first call on the press conference , they said that they did not have to stri@@ ve the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey mis@@ ed it to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize these . &quot;
there is no clear con@@ sensus about where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , when NATO member attacked Turkey , it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland are not available anymore
the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back@@ office role in the Bank &apos;s Board of Directors .
the Scotland Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
&quot; the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since , when they had to be saved almost k@@ oll@@ ed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time brand strateg@@ ists &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer brands . &quot;
they supported international sport with millions pounds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head office and the stock market set at Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for private customer business , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B will be busy at our Invest@@ ors brand , as well as the brand that our staff will be busy , as we now have more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say , we are not pursuing a global goals , but also track local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will be completely different in its own municipalities for something completely different , and our employees will work among these brands with clients . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing will not lead any more and that it will increase the perception of various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , as we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make it a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Executive Board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ically three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can be launched this brand again , so I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit in New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ying champagne after a double at New@@ market , who brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain in New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track , with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
the 45 year old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which has reached a milestone in the flat race .
&quot; Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here &quot;
&quot; I am very happy about it , that it happened at New@@ market because I &apos;m working here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he re@@ covering the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two yo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 times winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the nine times Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ avans . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone reached just a few before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct who distingu@@ ishes it from the other in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic amb@@ ass@@ adors for racing , enthusiasm , enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already since years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie before a few weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om that he would have brought 6,000 profits if he would not only be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in UK , Frank@@ ie has suffered almost 30 years of winning players , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition it is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone of a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes , Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the brit@@ ish flat on two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ es gain , including his famous &quot; glorious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived an aircraft crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had initially difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month sper@@ re , but showed an impressive strength to beat his bi@@ ans and to his top shape . &quot;
&quot; and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori has said earlier , that he wants to continue with cont@@ ests until his least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life . &quot;
Russian President Putin f@@ abled Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent away his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was many years part of Putin &apos;s closest trust in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and Transport affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , Putin is said that Putin have ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who had been deputy representative since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn , he made his conclusion at the renowned State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the website of Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is ( in Russian ) that he later became the leader of the head of the head of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thanks for your confidence . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s the most important task of government to support law as head of state , and inspec@@ tions for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has asked to leave his position and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet intelligence service in K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that Chief of Staff came back on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridicul@@ ous of the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power fighting ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man , who once had been praised as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which will be quoted on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to trust the post four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V recorded the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Military Intelligence ( FS@@ B ) , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin at power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was assumed that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V would have been President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term of Putin would have driven Putin against the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this item was taken by another , seam@@ less ally Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
&quot; Putin was Prime Minister , before he became president of three and a half years later . &quot;

ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
&quot; a population of Ban@@ ff asked for the identification of fish aid , which appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could act with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sp@@ un by a fountain of fountain . &quot;
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of spectac@@ le in hope that somebody could throw something light on the appearance of two inches long fish . &quot;
Queens@@ bury Crossing : bridge connected to Fi@@ fe
the cost of € 1.@@ 35 billion was scheduled to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Queens@@ on@@ Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four se@@ per@@ si@@ fications of &quot; covers , &quot; which is the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the fi@@ fe section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 cl@@ amps . &quot;
the cost of € 1.@@ 35 billion was scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; Minister of Economic Affairs Keith Brown was visiting the construction site today and was one of the first , which went from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when the construction of the Queens@@ th cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art at this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the passport . &quot;
&quot; a total of almost 79 % of all spectac@@ les in their place and last section of the Dec@@ ks get a bet@@ ong@@ ation for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted along the bridge to his place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Head of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter is the forward @-@ looking high and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after installing the last street section and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern ascent bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; massi@@ vely , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt is 222 metres long , it weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up with an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; hei@@ ght@@ ings , as the toler@@ ances , which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only some milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ e@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness still alive &quot; &quot; after they were thrown by their fishing boat in front of the Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alert after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moving from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ted around , and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already woven the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 and hanged without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they came all aboard the coastal area and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water are happiness to be hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a stop@@ over , but this dissolved itself at the pot of the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has dar@@ ed today about these men .
hard hurt - man cap@@ tiv@@ ates on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police over@@ took yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of the non @-@ alcoholic dam@@ er the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this was come into the apartment , he stab@@ bed to her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and in the body .
the police could decrease the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
these al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished his sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that &apos;s why she went out of the house with her life .
on the street they met the ex @-@ life partner of the man .
&quot; as the two women gu@@ essed the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and took his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who is building Braun@@ schwei@@ gs favorable apartments ?
the SPD and Green mine : investors should have to be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1300 inexpensive apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes to the next advice for the project living . &quot;
but contro@@ versy is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD faction leader Christoph Brat@@ mann meant : &quot; we are in the countryside with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban surfaces , must show 20 percent of all apartments as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the advant@@ ageous apartments can also arise in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great deal of the town hall is , however , thus the Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you want to build investors with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors at least 10 percent of these areas , but as possible to build 20 percent of the apartments as a social housing . &quot;
a new municipal housing program that will cost millions of costs and will still be financed for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; the problem , such as the Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few regulations .
the left is still on duty to investors for investors .
&quot; regardless of this , viol@@ ist , by whi@@ pped a con@@ sti@@ p@@ ening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; will conduct the concept of action , which will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get skilled workers .
&quot; yet , the program is not entirely entirely : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how does one compare the loss of more about 1,300 inexpensive apartments , whose funding will run out in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planning policy of Nicole Palm , should now be sold out of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the West city .
on a blow would solve the problem .
&quot; because in the west city , walk to the end of the year . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be back in the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : that would not want the owners of private homes .
&quot; because the number of social dwellings in the West city is dra@@ stically increased , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called line mixture . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in only a few districts should not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there is still movement in discussion .
&quot; S &amp; D Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes , &quot; for a broad majority must the CDU with the boat . &quot;
those are concentrated on more building sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise could not be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that te@@ ens and children do not go out without any more , but rather it prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , people are going to get people from the sofa and get more active . &quot;
&quot; the screen at the beginning of the screen was initially limited to television , then limited to video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that was based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a drawing show , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop@@ culture , interest in the game fell slightly before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand , which over@@ loaded the servers . &quot;
&quot; within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphones outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons , who were followed with a GPS , once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; caught . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation , playing the game , when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ology , an app for Apple Watch , who pursued 35,000 users , divided the Washington Post recently with that , within two days after launching the game , the number of people pursued every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the resources for power auction .
&quot; many public access campaigns for health , people want to bring to &quot; &quot; take up 30 minutes &quot; to come &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; have ears because many public messages are getting boring and come from people coming in . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be assessed . &quot;
&quot; whoever drives regularly Sport , reduces its chances to suffer cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to perform it here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , that makes them fun . &quot;
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always there are m@@ ür@@ rical game destro@@ ys , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk around a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even though smart apps like Fit@@ bit did already follow our activity before , they did not use any reason to do sports , as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new will lose its appeal , and the use will be followed by time . &quot;
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games , apps and virtual reality with the activity will be united in the real world and help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is at all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beams .
stunning on the ground .
on all line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday were going to become a surplus to fight and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games .
their overall score of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly marked in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; medal winner A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ nt at the pig farmers at the Olympic Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fighting game , and a total of fifth , while they are holding their reputation , the best of its generation , or even ever . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her final result was shown and her long journey was in this moment an end . &quot;
this success makes them in the same league like unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports into new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years of her sports , 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she &apos;s &quot; the best gy@@ mn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting this last review in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between it and a last over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a hand@@ ful gold back to family in Spring , Texas , would be considered to be dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ cing , after they have won gold and silver in the individual majority of women during the summer season 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on top , during their long departure on top , never to have the future , it &apos;s not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tailored to Latin American music that would match at home at the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and adopted by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans Mutter during a school trip to the gy@@ mn@@ asium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no surplus competition for the summer of 2013 , a winning stre@@ ak , which will take as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina was easy through two turns , the picture sli@@ pped . &quot;
floating bars and dent@@ ures - in which you keep the world championship title - lau@@ ked .
&quot; she repeated again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig , and set it on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced them gently as they expected their du@@ ck - a pure formation - and tears fell on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in their collection book . &quot;
&quot; the power of Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when they fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a depth of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man had a lead in which the Americans called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; is a lead .
&quot; after her soil practice , she threw herself to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback that was sometimes doub@@ tful . &quot;
&quot; as regards Bil@@ es , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old twe@@ et has a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass strike at the car in the car
&quot; according to police reports , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the most le@@ thal attacks against Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis Dau@@ gh@@ ter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ weapon , while it was on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police declared that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder couldn &apos;t have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory @-@ everything , because the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the pol@@ ze@@ iser by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of investig@@ ators led the investig@@ ators to become a close look , whether they are connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven attacks were killed and two injured in Hisp@@ anic residential areas within four months . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence , which they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ itali@@ zed because of their injuries , and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness divided by the police , that it was not unusual for it to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot;
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that was targeted on an empty pic@@ up truck half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat and ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 year old with Micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the fe@@ west of his age , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of an genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I create that . &quot;
I can &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me alone .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has let down it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her was informed that Edmund she can never realize her under circumstances , and that he may not survive once . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to have him institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help to help .
Edmund could neither still sit down until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it makes progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Edmund asked for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something off &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring to him the drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- tells her . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ y has a wide range of causes : genetic as in Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ avirus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
&quot; it is still too early to say , as it is affecting life with the z@@ ik@@ avirus . &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to reminds us of the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she doesn &apos;t really know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time anymore because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me .
&quot; but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage , caused by the z@@ ik@@ avirus . &quot;
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainfall , flood gives reason to b@@ ail@@ out in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
heavy rainfall and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on Friday the emergency . it will be counted on Saturday the whole Saturday with more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Str@@ pp@@ is flooded their bank and threatened with large floo@@ ding in extreme rain@@ falls , reported the national weather service . &quot;
&quot; the Governor of Louisiana John B@@ el Edwards divided with that state officials , standing in contact with the local authorities , have already been on the way to the affected communities . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , divided with that the requests for high water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags multiplied . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said , that alone the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand bags . &quot;
a flood warning system will be used across the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
the weather service would leave that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could be falling to rain .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ amas , a flood warning system was deployed on Friday while it continues to rain in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , all li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood will reach record levels after the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers might survive many houses in the areas near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ stream of floo@@ ding in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish has a danger , as these are slowly flowing through the plain rivers into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Tick@@ et@@ w , south of the Mississippi border border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest point on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams always stop people from the flood water in the south @-@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located over 400 feet from his house , rise over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who lives near , had warned . &quot;
&quot; we woke up and poured out the water , and poured out in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; Hans@@ ford &apos;s wife said she had lived in the 48 years where she lived there , never had such a rise of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said , he and his family members would have all the disabilities and he would be the only one that can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a big military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood was spread out quickly , &quot; as it continued to have severe rainfall , and that the authorities were evacu@@ ating evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann a ob@@ servers near Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground was significantly reduced since Wednesday .
the authorities gave that heavy rain@@ falls and roads flooded the rescue of inhabitants of their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary transmitter WW@@ L reported that a two @-@ flooded houses in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a 200 survived .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were both flooded now . &quot;
&quot; the incident of the church Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities were saved 72 people and seven pets , which were washed from floods . &quot;
in the cities Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond were provided emergency shel@@ ters to host the evacu@@ ated .
&quot; once the water starts back again , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ho@@ a , almost two dozen roads were closed due to the floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents , who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in boiling point , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ y said that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a hand@@ ful houses should have been reported on Thursday as well as to have been reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I &apos;ve never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; spher@@ es through balls , &quot; survived fir@@ ing in Philadelphia &quot;
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week was the second time that a 6 @-@ year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several shots of ab@@ uses , including one leg , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he did a lot , his small body was extingu@@ ished by balls , &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ sm@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to under@@ go several operations .
&quot; the boy &apos;s family divided the station with , that it is expected to be rest@@ rained . &quot;
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
&quot; three men were shot also , at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found herself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not in the car and the police were determined , whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , viol@@ ated the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it clearly acted in a constant fight .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ ways , were se@@ clu@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; it seems that several armed fighters have been given to have been involved in the country , divided by police raid Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several homes and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest and the police are currently checked , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a ra@@ cket on the arm when she played before her house in the West O@@ ak Lane in front of her house . &quot;
they re@@ bo@@ unded and the police are still searching for a susp@@ ect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that &apos;s what I imagine among the women &apos;s Olympics and that is out of more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspired for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Cath@@ o@@ lik@@ in , round , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has gr@@ asp@@ ed the black and Hisp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic champion and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they unexpected , yet master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone had won the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the tip of this sport , but so you don &apos;t see gym classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way like A@@ ly and Madison to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympics will only have four gy@@ mn@@ ast within the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is so that Tur@@ ns may combine a more expensive sport and Turner will join the first line in private gy@@ mn@@ asium who come up by parents who come up for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ mn@@ asium are in wealthy suburbs that can support business .
&quot; in these publishers , the Turner will receive its entire training and this is a very expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained her athletes , since they started with the Tur@@ ns . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by the communities of Au@@ n , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easy @-@ to @-@ accessible gy@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
I founded my gy@@ mn@@ asium of 20 years .
&quot; with my events , we have offered free and affordable gy@@ mna@@ stics in Harlem for over 15,000 people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained as national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gy@@ mna@@ stics to learn the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ acy for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ lasting benefits for health and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this crew , which bring thousands of young girls to interest , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of Olympic team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you so many young girls are motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after they refused Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes due to the acceptance of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 37@@ ,000 assist@@ ants associated with an election , refused it . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt had revealed plans to susp@@ end the contract , and said that N@@ HS had been involved in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay for employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant doctors will receive a new contract , which contains changes on night and weekly work to improve care times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Kom@@ mitt@@ ees for assistant doctors said last night in a message with &quot; &quot; Assi@@ stance doctors have put on the proposed Treaty as before serious concerns , in particular that there will be the current occupation crisis , and it will be ab@@ dic@@ ated to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; for eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts by the BM@@ A on the solution of disp@@ utes through talks during the government on contradi@@ ctions and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the case of a say that the Jeremy Hunt had made it the last month , that his door would always be revealed . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , raise the penetration , and concerns the concerns of assistance doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do this , he did not do this , so they are willing to carry out further mig@@ rant workers . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a boost of almost 13,000 rout@@ in@@ ations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in order to grant physicians to the string . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to end the dispute over the changes due to the acceptance of the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week @-@ to @-@ date for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS employees , urged the doctors to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ si said : &quot; &quot; working measures do not reach anything but little , but already over@@ charged teams and service providers and prepare their patients , nursing , and their families only wor@@ ries , ad@@ versity and interru@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in the past two months , we talked to the department of the assistant doctors , and with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries respon@@ ds to concerns regarding the concerns and hist@@ ochem@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employer hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility of training , training courses , mutual recognition of the schedule , training courses , and the gender Ministry concerning compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness leaves election campaign in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption .
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to this fact that widespread election amounted to Muslim communities , as a devastating government report today revealed today . &quot;
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es attacks the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ houses to have evidence of electoral abuse because of &quot; hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now a anti @-@ corruption scandal that would be so bad that the duty of voters from religious moti@@ fs would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set aside out off elections outside of elec@@ tive voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a ID to their identity , to prove their identity . &quot;
at present a elec@@ torate has to call his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests , not removable ink on the finger of a person if they give their election to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , Sir Eric says . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of not official documents or working groups .
&quot; this is not just for electoral fraud , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial imp@@ eller culture that comes to protect &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets campaign as in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the re@@ ig@@ ning mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man decided to corrupt after a lit@@ urg@@ y on corrupt and illegal practices of his amber . &quot;
&quot; the Court was found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he would have put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis , that it is the cor@@ dial obligation of Muslims to vote him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doub@@ tful , or the result of a im@@ itation , in which one person cho@@ oses others . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said , that in the whole country there was evidence of fraud . &quot;
he expressed himself in particular al@@ ar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent mail code - in which the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the guiding of the identity , to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on protection of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people to vote in accordance with the will@@ ingness of elderly , in particular communities with pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ quet background . &quot;
&quot; there were doubts that ... state institutions such a behaviour as of &quot; politically correct &quot; belie@@ fs regarding eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion did not be ignor@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists of the proposals are allowed to stop &quot; election &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is pulled by Ther@@ esa May in consideration , also requires harder registration verification to prevent the election list of immigration and social purposes . &quot;
&quot; to consider , voters will be asking for your ID . &quot;
&quot; do not remove any ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she made her voice to prevent any one cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are in@@ correct .
a three @-@ year limitation to proposals on an automatic selection process .
prohibition that political activists work full envelope and envel@@ opes .
the police force the auth@@ orization to set up bul@@ b@@ ings for election stations .
a change of law that facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment due to re@@ jection of the Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( 1983 ) .
photographer for@@ b@@ ade in electoral stations .
requirement that only English can be used in voting stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensive training of training to ensure that the employees will rule the rule that voters go to the election .
&quot; Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that there was no criminal complaint after the Tower Ham@@ lets case . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has said Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy , due to a lit@@ urg@@ y on corrupt and illegal practices than un@@ fit , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons for immediate effect , he was found guilty according to the high demands in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; waste control &quot; of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Supreme Court in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is responsible for the Mother of Parliament , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and leuk@@ emia of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

&quot; but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only one to fighting for gold , who has his own famous doubles - at least not if one may give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which are running on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics , who are more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood &apos;s most famous sites . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ unter and Wolf : team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison , left , is compared to his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o &quot;
&quot; aside from the railway race , there were many people on the Internet on the bike race as a certain arch@@ et@@ cher of the Di@@ dy@@ mus A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
the team member of the US team in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ l@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures where he looks like the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ y .
&quot; in fact , the archers hit the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave to that he had already heard his childhood since his childhood that he looks like Leo looks like . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see great simil@@ arity , except for the facial hair@@ y , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do that as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; one of the most popular compar@@ is@@ ons since London 2012 will undoubtedly occur in the centre : the resulting simil@@ arity between the British expan@@ se Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford , and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris . &quot;
the Russian gy@@ mn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big and expres@@ sive eyes is to be passed as a double @-@ viol@@ inist for the Cuban American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared to the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .

&quot; another comparison between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mann was dra@@ gged , who has similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medals swi@@ mmer in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just the sun @-@ fired skin and blonde hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan said Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dexter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar visual form and eyes &quot;
not only the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy about that others like the simil@@ ar@@ ities .

&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is switched off , when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ t swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought to the C@@ BS on board in the comm@@ ent@@ ators of C@@ BS on board , one could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; he was excited as M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for that .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the Flo@@ st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which allowed the edge to close the gap to China . &quot;
&quot; viewers in the whole Canada re@@ acted fast , after they were sho@@ cked by the sound and the language . &quot;
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comments just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer made from China &quot; like a pig died ? &quot; ? ? ? &quot;
&quot; the idi@@ ot did not capit@@ ulate , that they were still on broadcast . &quot;
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described in the final 4 x 200m Fre@@ t swimming pool for women . this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; the criticism against Byron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many presented to him . &quot;
&quot; Twitter suggest not back when they heard , such as uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel Byron Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you only represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like R@@ assi@@ sts . # .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who presented the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment on a swimming pool . &quot;
&quot; it was a un@@ fortunate formulation , we &apos;re sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 90 times , C@@ BC ologi@@ zed for the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt on Twitter &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ators Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s name
&quot; C@@ BC and added his exc@@ use for more than 90 other Twitter Us@@ ers , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments &quot;
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it right , that these statements were made and , that it was possible to be broadcast . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed fast to our viewers at the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in social media . &quot;
&quot; in order to make one clear@@ er , Byron &apos;s comments rel@@ ates to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ adequ@@ ately elected formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ Donald enrolled in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment that I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I paid me to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers , and did not refer to it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was no abuse , and I &apos;m sorry for it . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged on woman who under@@ wear a under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman went out their clothes in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered , as she saw in it , and pulled it back , and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
they continue on and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping center in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ d@@ son found himself at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear the under@@ wear , she turned back , and the business went , without buying them . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the retail area , she took a pair of under@@ pants out of the outside , moved its own streets and tro@@ users and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she tried not even to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - it was simply there , che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; they repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t really liked it , and went out . &quot;
&quot; it seemed not to distur@@ b that they observed anyone , or thinking about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think someone would take under@@ pants after home that had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tries to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what exactly is good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants , and to find out that another woman had her and returned and not washed her . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that happened on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;

how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a in front of arms .
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video from Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him more secure .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed c@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; regardless of it , whether you are approaching from the front or rear , this video will show you how to turn off the sk@@ e@@ wer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if one gets you back from behind , then you should turn aside when you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out of the gun line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him so@@ cks with the knees into the breasts , and turn back , while the att@@ ack@@ ers accum@@ ulates before pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him back to the face and move back down@@ wards , while they turn the weapon to him . &quot;
&quot; with anxiety , which are approaching from the front , the technique is similar to your body from the gun line , grab your weapon and twist them , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the weight on the weapon and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his grip , before they move back and raise the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi .

Reis@@ er Ian Wright sl@@ ab@@ t for a guide for his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller under@@ nourished his immune system and Wür@@ ger@@ ef@@ lex a serious test - making some of the most poll@@ uted and har@@ dest places of Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k moved his position on a ban@@ ister along the Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; prior to the end of each object , he used a lumin@@ ance to show and show us what he will let . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought to le@@ stick the flush of a draw@@ back , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left behind what he t@@ apped , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his Dar@@ ms by travelling through the world , and ate strange things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; public rail@@ ways to train stations up to rinse items of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told me : &quot; as a child , I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just for his call . &quot;
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his pro@@ be@@ ak showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; in comparison , the L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry weight is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to withdraw after their L@@ umin@@ omet@@ ry was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands were less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have t@@ arri@@ ed in a toilet , close . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing more dirt than that !
I will do nothing here because it is in@@ tim@@ eless here .
the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ os@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to do something new to the consumer . &quot;
&quot; something that is fascinating , and at the same time , the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics explains . &quot;
we brought crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that we ended that we said &quot; Leave us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and as it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film director , added : &quot; let me say so , &quot; I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had wished some of the things I have told him , just like the ek@@ el@@ dy Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian , to do it and others , where this was pretty difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we have recorded some of these dirty delic@@ ac@@ ies on film .
&quot; in a validation of validation conducted by the year 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a homos@@ exual family left her social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 , because she had terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after being violent from their property , the property of the residential property found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls will be scre@@ wed on , wood panels were excited , rub@@ b@@ ish has been scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was ador@@ ned by the walls . &quot;
&quot; the family were transferred , and it is believed to be living in a private accommodation now . &quot;
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she fears no longer to repair the apartment . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to take into account , since this property is thought to be considered not so beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had joined the family , ad@@ mitt@@ ance of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drugs and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood at the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under conditions , old gar@@ bage was found . &quot;
&quot; in the estate , where drugs have been tra@@ ded in the past drugs , the wood di@@ dy@@ es were excited &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they had to fight on the streets , and they regularly had to be called by the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ og@@ gles her and her partner her week violent from the property after they gave them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily .
&quot; the del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours , who told her life to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; They were afraid for anyone . &quot;
we lived for 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep tomorrow . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , wherever they are gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; in Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , told that the family had to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the out@@ washed side of the municipal house , tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that the les@@ ion ab@@ used to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and to their family , as a delay is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , because the behaviour was extremely terrible and their deeds for their neighbours must be terrible . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the church , who have been cour@@ ageous for us and have made us the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate a few neighbors , and the message is convey@@ ed that ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had been living in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , located in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ og@@ ation of the ground . &quot;
workers of the household administration will now have to move tr@@ ash@@ ore that sur@@ round the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police initiated a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as orph@@ an@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alien and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
skel@@ eton has given a fine fine after being found guilty of a threat of class B in trade agreement .
it claimed that the money for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee skel@@ eton was born in 2013 in a car accident .
&quot; after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner live in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ ded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will check r@@ enters , which will not comply with the house order . &quot;
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w , by the Devon and Corn@@ wall , divided the Del@@ og@@ ation of a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that don &apos;t hold on the house order . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they may behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been accounted for by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior that continue to cooperate with partners , to protect our communities . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump grants ″ mighty problems &quot; in election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Rep@@ ublic@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditional conservative states of their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now weak@@ nesses of his electoral campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ safe M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 rival inside the Republi@@ can camp from the race , now the doubts grow in the fight around the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked support in major states such as Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; false reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took his acquain@@ ted media reports again . &quot;
republi@@ can high bur@@ dens
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; by a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ USA from June to June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes may look forward , but not with the distance that are custom@@ ary for republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
as endangered as Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump replied to the question of how he would stop the rise of Clinton &apos;s son : &quot; just as I did it so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether behind it : this will be either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is doing nothing else than &quot; tell the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich in order for him , because of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump should have threatened funds for the support of its election campaign , it should not present any better conversion values . &quot;
&quot; instead of that , one wants to take advantage of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans for Congress stronger than the arms . &quot;
Olympia : tri@@ ster sc@@ am with D@@ oping Test
the IOC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ commission in the event .
Ken@@ yan athletes threatened after the second D@@ oping affair in Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games .
&quot; after an attempted attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach at home . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the International Olympic Committee told him to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a ken@@ ian function was informed that the former Sprinter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village was a Ur@@ in @-@ sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team deriv@@ ation of Ken@@ yan from the D@@ oping check@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF World association announces the IOC for information about the case to prove its own investigation and distributed a IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the analysis and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an evaluation , &quot; said it in a IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and has issued a f@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; said Ken@@ yan Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was the possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of athletes who stood on the list of training checks of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich turned over 800 metres in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Athletics delegates Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio games . &quot;
he should have informed about cash flow athletes of his country on the standing D@@ oping tests .
according to media reports he will be arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi .
&quot; at the IOC , Kenya has already been under special observation since a long time during the IOC . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement of the IOC stored in the Rio Olympics , more than 2000 d@@ oping controls in front of the Rio games was un@@ noticed that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into visa . &quot;
the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic start .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose D@@ oping combat compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports , ARD has always been dra@@ fted , that in Kenya D@@ oping funds will be easily accessible and there is a considerable ment@@ ality of the sport . &quot;
IOC member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar study in Kenya as he had asked them in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this context , it could be proven that in this sport area widespread and systematically adjusted . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival plays the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a trag@@ ical love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
there is a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ chim@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth .
in the orchestra the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezuel@@ an conduc@@ tors Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say they were very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix - the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ der . &quot;
&quot; she reminds himself with mel@@ anch@@ oly on her lovers , with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dancing . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascin@@ ated me .
first because it is exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I am Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh , Pre@@ t@@ ty , I , Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; therefore it is smart , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman &quot; , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such a honor for us to work with her .
she is a tremendous human being .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one can see it in any of his movements , in his bli@@ sters , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joyful approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; : &quot; this piece is about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we passed the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same subjects , and they are as well as powerful as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish assembly does not expect mass cur@@ s@@ ist
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the ruler of the Gü@@ len Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short , the Kurdish Municip@@ ality of Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of protection looking from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term it could even be &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; the presi@@ ding Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish congregation in Germany are expecting a mass cur@@ s@@ ist to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands , in the medium term with some hundreds of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to oppos@@ e the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; World War &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed Kurdish high @-@ bur@@ sts with pen@@ alties , 500,000 Kurds are in Turkey on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the twi@@ sted coup nor sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal , ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will begin to start in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that mig@@ rated to refugees in his own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the law of law lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an cities . &quot;
&quot; with that , Erdo@@ gan may increase the emig@@ rate to the remaining Kurds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ minated in the past hundred years or exp@@ elled , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
the government of government demanded that the government is positioned as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers .
&quot; even in Germany , a &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is held . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire marking as a Gü@@ len pendant destroyed teachers and other acade@@ m@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , President of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , the Turks had already identified the biggest group of asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; for the reporting date June 30 , this is 11.@@ 386 people and thus nearly 29 percent of all have been recognized ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this collection , there are no hiding from war , poverty or her@@ e@@ pl@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ eth after the Basic Law are only politically , i.e. from government site , individually followed . &quot;

in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; because so far , it is not so far : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ break@@ ers - that is enclosed . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als that are convinced by the elections are to be convinced , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers , which are in the country , are on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are no loc@@ als , so not to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang up posters , ballo@@ ons blo@@ ds , fl@@ yers and exp@@ ire at the end of the vote , only to drive . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern will have to talk about a campaign about the people on the day until 4 September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and there &apos;s also something about : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 , is now the strongest party , clearly lies behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; exciting , how strong Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ rec@@ t cuts out and what remains at the end of co@@ stum@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; since 2008 , Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and has been head of government for an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his grandfather . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ds a little with the people , as it already did his legendary legend Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , soul master@@ ing cold feet and then Chancellor Merkel is the blame for the blo@@ om of the African . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We are making the rise of sp@@ oo@@ king lists , which will probably cost him good post now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top can@@ did@@ actic candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how to make the wrong time at the right place election campaign . &quot;
she has served two Chancellor Angela Merkel in the east German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Merkel in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mec@@ en@@ ger@@ m and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but there is also a shame from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the Nor@@ theast CDU was largely dependent on the usual election campaign and shopping m@@ alls with paras@@ ols and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , so co@@ ca@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that , on the land , it is the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it works like the left hand , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly any country in the country . &quot;
&quot; however , the advice of the CDU elec@@ ts co@@ co@@ res to his co @-@ election is also self @-@ adhesive : &quot; they have to go where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , golden weddings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because much on the game stands , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the African Union ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the green , small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will make the jump into the country day . &quot;
they make a modern virtu@@ e out of the holiday @-@ need and dis@@ close their election campaign to the Internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; we call the state president Claudia Mu@@ eller . &quot;
otherwise green bal@@ ancing people go to native search for local stim@@ ulation amongst the vac@@ ations .
&quot; sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top @-@ edge di@@ lap@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ cl@@ en@@ duc@@ al lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Re@@ furb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
&quot; with the speed of 27 , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the work of construction , which begin at 5.@@ 30 in the morning , and only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are al@@ ar@@ ming praise . &quot;
&quot; these have made everything pretty rocky , &quot; tells El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet gas station . &quot;
this is a superb team .
there is no train .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the end of October , until the end of October , everything is finished . &quot;
&quot; will also be praised for the construction of the construction , such as it concerns the establishment of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site moved to south on Monday to the south , and the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has come back , the traffic situation in the place is relaxed . &quot;
citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the other traffic through the place seems to be back .
&quot; there were partially considerable complaints , &quot; says that for the expansion management of the refurb@@ ishment , chief executive director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ el road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sle@@ dges were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i trusted as the signs . &quot;
&quot; in this purpose , what led to some truck in residential areas . &quot;
&quot; as well , the speed lim@@ it@@ ments were not adher@@ ed to the assembly , the assembly intensi@@ fied the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable adv@@ ances , &quot; says King , who made herself a location on the location . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute lit@@ tered .
the fast @-@ speed was on the way back with 77 hour kilometers in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site continued , however , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business people at B 27 , it is only a small comfort that we are now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business people don &apos;t want to look like . &quot;
&quot; however , that the B 27 @-@ generation has led to them for a turnover of turnover , everybody is asking you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some people and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , there are hardly any consequences for the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; no slight decline &quot; , &quot; however , a dream that of course is missing &quot; the run . &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ exploited are the local road along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , the owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
that is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all the restaurants were hit &quot; hard . &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
up to &quot; far more than 50 percent of the revenue recorded .
road rein@@ forcement has thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his staff he had to let go .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and the half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise , the restaurant prof@@ icient to take advantage of the advantages of the B 27 . now , it also needs the draw@@ backs that resulted in refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where there was so much more generous . &quot;
&quot; at all Kl@@ agen , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been around since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; according to the most complicated traffic management , other regular guests can now understand less frequently , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also nice . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crisis of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clients for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in their long time history . &quot;
six months of construction work that &apos;s already brutal .
&quot; constantly , in the name of terror attacks on laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , the Minister of Interior de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a future status deal with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say about all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals are reasonable to be the coalition partner &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior within the introduction of his new security plans . &quot;
they do not require anybody .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participated in it too .
&quot; as the Interior Minister , he was located to results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach passed a little time before he presented his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
&quot; but they , however , fall more extensive , but more extensive . &quot;
&quot; a lot is known , announced , announced that a new security authority to take care of the bu@@ ck encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives for passenger data and arms . &quot;
the call after more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second start for suggestions which have not been doing with the SPD to be so far : he wants to set sympath@@ e@@ ity for terrorist groups and ch@@ aps jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; dre@@ aming the CDU man . &quot;
&quot; however , he still keeps this for reasonable and demanding nothing of what led with the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in themselves : he plans quick procedures for deportation and more possibilities to detention of people before the deportation .
&quot; refugees that are fet@@ ched into the country in advance , should noti@@ fy their smart phones before initi@@ ate social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; at Dul@@ ces for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than ever - such as those who commit criminal off@@ ences or their papers to wear their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legally holy .
some even appears un@@ balanced and leaves questions openly .
and with some points - in the ine@@ quality of Ged@@ ali@@ an for example - the question arises : what does that have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between subjects refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be found in dis@@ agree that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people in view of the high refugee figures are concerned about safety . &quot;
&quot; and things that work in the people , were unable to cl@@ utter@@ ed themselves in constitu@@ ency times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the devices in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaign . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of internal safety , Union and SPD are becoming increasingly becoming increasingly in position . &quot;
&quot; during the last days , between the two parties there went high . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Unions of the Interior Minister , in which the res@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also here to reconc@@ ile sounds .
&quot; from a return from a double pass , he doesn &apos;t stop . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; they restart , be not sensible . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitutional to all corners , and if it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ al@@ ition@@ er , has only to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it to worry about war .
&quot; the SPD , however , is presently trying to pro@@ filing an internal security on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ itu@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel signals only a c@@ auti@@ ous conversation and says , &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything which contributes to the security further . &quot;
Volkswagen is still arriving by Volkswagen .
&quot; despite diesel engines , the suppliers will rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets there is round .
in the return action there is vort@@ ex around a term .
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries of deliveries into the second half of the year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest passenger car can continue to advance an increase in the current year despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the nuclear brand VW was weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and thus loaded the sale of sales , such as the company in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the brand sold VW brand in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; chief brand of Staff Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July , especially on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there have been a purchasing power supply in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for the outlet comes from the EU , explained a spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the exhaust gases first escal@@ ate , there is also a min@@ us too be@@ ech . &quot;
large supports for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the primarily affected house stamp of the Lower Saxony is further affected by the diesel scandal : after the first seven months only a loss of 0.9 percent is estimated to be 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales office from January to July . &quot;
&quot; in this period , Volkswagen provided more than 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , with 5.@@ 904 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software tests .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million cars to re@@ armament in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after upgrading the vehicles there is no wor@@ sen@@ ing fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the high@@ ways place the customer after the re@@ armament of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; but I &apos;m not speaking of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate parties . &quot;
reason to legal host@@ esses .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen has granted its German customers a guarantee for new diesel models . &quot;
this had confirmed the last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ ativ in the Federal State Department .
&quot; from the administration of the department , it was confirmed that this meeting was announced . &quot;
&quot; VW has to meet the resolutions of my In@@ quiry Commission , and KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; said President Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has ensured the guarantee that we have no change in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion no deteri@@ or@@ ations , and all the typical relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen himself used the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate circuits .
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; , Volkswagen will see the opportunity for example half a year after the retro@@ fitting of approximately with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could bring back to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to avoid the customer &apos;s interest , that it does not affect any other damage , which does not have nothing to do with the remedy , regarding any warranty claims , as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW is using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity plans at the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Josef Paul , Chief Executive Officer , Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only about 139 customers who par@@ don@@ ate 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily payments . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see a signal : normal savings would not have to be feared to pay for their savings .
&quot; store banks money over night during the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , you must pay 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and company customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily balance . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for more than 40 million Euros , it could be withdrawn from one day to the others and could not be able to use it . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account , and causing 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank@@ roll . &quot;
I can not go for every million 4000 euros .
the cost he moves on after the P@@ urs@@ ach@@ er@@ principle now .
&quot; the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four attacks , I &apos;d like to see the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and altern@@ ately on other assets .
few emigrated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , &quot; act @-@ efficient is not possible . &quot;
&quot; for example , some German banks have increased their fees for account surveys , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ berg Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had made headlines from three million euros .
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the Bank of Bank , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect to pay a deal of private consumers , in addition to banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , &quot; there is a chin @-@ up which is equipped with wealth . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has established branch offices in Bad Wies@@ ia , R@@ ott@@ le @-@ E@@ ver , Kre@@ uth , and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepren@@ eur . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no further banks known to the cooperative association of Bavaria , &quot; said spokesperson for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of the German national banks and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ banks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negatives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it dro@@ pping the migration of investors to the competition . &quot;
customers in Germany don &apos;t like to have that in the width .
destination records : who are actually buying records ?
lon@@ ely males heart age love plates .
&quot; before you go to the comm@@ ens@@ er , to over@@ se@@ w him under the p@@ seudonym non @-@ binding men &apos;s accus@@ ation , this statement runs from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most elabor@@ ate revival of records did not want to be seen on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that we want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but to the Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have bought a record recently , are all prec@@ eded by age 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ ish group . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older record runners retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a message report on television , I would follow the camera while I wait in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit and wild gest@@ ure , before I stand before I keep my hands hold on it , and let us take a look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os slowly affects its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller is based - is there a hand@@ ful fantastic record specialist . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera of camera to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand up in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation . &quot;
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men mean age ) in Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data : eight men mean age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) sequence , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I wonder ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot via e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , put the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy it when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , in which I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who buy plates are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my case .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works in Sister Ray , also believe that many customers who meets the You@@ go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave to people who have influenced by the media , people who have heard about com@@ eback to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; by the talks who I have led , people usually have off@@ ended their collection at the beginning of 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their records sold to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to the disc se@@ wer@@ age of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phon@@ ica to recognize that record businesses offers a so@@ othing community of equ@@ il@@ ations .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers participated in the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and would like to move back to the stability of trusted sound records , of objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is me as collectors and I think it &apos;s so many people .
it is a simple way to deal fal@@ sely .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; &quot; well , a staff of a plate stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , they haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also out that 41 % have one record player , they never use it while 7 % of those who buy a plate , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very much worried while I bl@@ asted through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ iler . &quot;
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data : three men mean age ) has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone recently entered here and said , &quot; &quot; I have no record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radio record , so I &apos;d like to put it into shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musicians . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who just come slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , dedicated to the record plates almost a whole floor , has an under@@ mining audience than I clean@@ se . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make pictures , Teen@@ agers and women middle aged . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts of the latest syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ ist pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ um@@ ps - is it good to see such diversity in the customer .
&quot; none of them is particularly lon@@ ely lon@@ ely , but brand psych@@ otic trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around business for a couple of minutes and viewed the Vari@@ et@@ ance for sale of the plates . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ bum@@ ble@@ bee than a big buy .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t make any much , therefore the collecting records are not a real option , &quot; she says . &quot;
it will cost much .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer , or to other way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it drives with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I admit the note , I observe the je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I observe a group of young teen cameras that moves to a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter think to buy a Cro@@ sley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can find a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a blend of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only in decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to handle it . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , even the one who is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even if my re @-@ resear@@ ches showed that the results of You@@ go@@ v vote , they are , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and On@@ line@@ for@@ s . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees by turn@@ tables of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while they supp@@ ress the rigid glance of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old mis@@ moder@@ ator who rises above the shoulders nothing wrong , middle age . &quot;
&quot; the Green@@ lan@@ hai , which is the longest living cycl@@ one - video collection &quot;

&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen , the shar@@ ks examined , says that the record was out at a female , assumed that it is between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long . &quot;

&quot; during a trial hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the state should carry down 72 pro@@ vis@@ ually stores to sell , selling hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places would be broken down because they would have to be a parallel economy , which would not be paid from tax and a fire @-@ risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups , not enough food for growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they are beyond that the provisional shops and restaurants often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run 72 pro@@ vis@@ es business , but admitted that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture are completely re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François M@@ olla said that food business , cafes and restaurants may play a much larger role than people live in extremely pre@@ valent conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the Lower @-@ cus@@ hion was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;s café of the camp , which is commonly used and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on request for hundreds of protection needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it said that the closure &quot; would be &quot; for this children of a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of Mig@@ rants inv@@ alu@@ able on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle @-@ camp has increased over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite the Olympic dis@@ appointment : Martin remains com@@ bu@@ d
&quot; despite his dis@@ appointing stage in the Olympic time , Rad@@ i didn &apos;t want to get Tony Martin &apos;s sake . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking forward the World Cup at a glance , stay confident and moving forward , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have a statement for his mis@@ erable space at the sugar hat .
&quot; I frank@@ ly told me to comment on yesterday &apos;s , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he needs to analyze the reasons for de@@ bac@@ le .
&quot; at the Tim@@ f@@ ahr @-@ World Cup in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed in the last time .
&quot; also my position , &quot; wrote my position , &quot; wrote three @-@ month time @-@ time @-@ world champion , which was lost on Wednesday at 54@@ ,5 km more than three minutes to the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Cancun ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

&quot; the technology group buys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which speci@@ alizes in this hobby . &quot;
&quot; how much money is flowing for the takeover , Microsoft shared on Thursday not . &quot;
&quot; Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January , and has already sold more than 100,000 users . &quot;
&quot; they can watch other games while playing , but also att@@ acking yourself . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation speed measurement : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested particularly effectively . &quot;
&quot; the Futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic trailer , in Wiesbaden , can be used for example on accident damage , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway building sites or to renov@@ ating Tem@@ plates there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that with a stationary gl@@ itter to ensure compliance with the speed limit . &quot;
a lasting mobil@@ er setup can be too dangerous or agile .
the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days at irregular intervals . the case data is transmitted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded across several tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed lim@@ it@@ ments as well as possible delivery charges according to time , vehicle strips and vehicle class also monitor . &quot;
&quot; moving in high @-@ driven condition , one can move the pendant according to any car with a trailer coupling . &quot;
&quot; in order that it is not easy to cl@@ ap , it is cut down in the measuring operation so that the wheels are dis@@ car@@ ded in the ar@@ mo@@ ose , and van@@ ishing by the way . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer is tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Rug@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fiji divided a master class at the handling , side step@@ ping , back down , line outlet , and raw power to win Gold - their first Olympic champion of any colour . &quot;
the defeat was failed by the silver medal in the silver medal - Great Britain - and they could definitely be proud of their efforts in that tournament in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall on them in the final . &quot;
but no matter of it in this form a 15 @-@ man team had to be beaten in top form .
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it is probably not likely that at least a bridge tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck , Ben Ryan , the former chef for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind itself .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost their game with Ryan Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they just lost one .
&quot; this s@@ lap will hurt , but the progress is astonishing . &quot;
Fiji began wonder@@ fully and made the GB@@ S out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell at and Co. to run into driving buses . the World Series winners went up to 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved up in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he walked . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly hit the ball .
&quot; a fier@@ y T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third gate to achieve , but it never stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch @-@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ whi@@ ff and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ sides by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as it was born in Fiji that was able to play 7 , while GB still has . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; UK led basic changes to half @-@ time through and completed the fi@@ ji@@ anic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant stop of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 but the game went long in favor of the South @-@ cons@@ ulate , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach to Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ dot with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff t@@ opped , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the GB cr@@ ammed and sm@@ itten down in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa into a s@@ nap @-@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion . &quot;
K@@ yle Brown brought the boat in the first half after the front but Dan N@@ orton crossed the line with an impressive foot@@ ing and scored a fool among the post in the second half .
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ axis teams , secured the winning - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting cancer with the rowing victory
there will be no bi@@ ke@@ ying gold than in these games and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first stro@@ kes up to the last , 220 tough H@@ ie@@ ve that enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who were sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the trainer Robin Williams , was always present as they were the second time in the history of British sports , which laid for such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ 15 un@@ cann@@ y use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , who gli@@ des over the surface with the elegance of tails , which does not contradi@@ ct the kind of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing a batt@@ ali@@ on to consent hel@@ ds which make the difference , and there was no one more useful than the coach who would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
how he said he ris@@ ky what is ris@@ ky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , the oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty aw@@ ful situation .
it changes a little view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin to the interru@@ ption of a minimum , if that is the correct concept under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I needed to go back soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it a bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the turbul@@ ent times of victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who spent an annoying tomorrow something more than anything else , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning who was a leader in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely simple but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be a massive thank you . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I would not have a better person to train@@ ers or wish a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the past 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the trial , stay in the process . &quot;
it &apos;s really important to tear down .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making something great .
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race which we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding on their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to gr@@ asp that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , exempl@@ ary for clarity &quot;
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ head group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , reti@@ re . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water association as an example for the great water producers .
so it was so much time ago in the original paper at the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water@@ forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia preached the purposes .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group compl@@ ained &quot; Bavarian @-@ far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old employee , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired to reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water industry with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water every year and provides 32 locations and ham@@ let with around 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ates are the churches of the church , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of B@@ aun@@ ach . &quot;
there are water suppliers for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos; Mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up as a water@@ shed in 1985 and was already appointed General Manager of the Federal Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his responsibilities are very diverse and they extended from the water @-@ management and maintenance activities , the bud@@ get@@ ing work , bud@@ get@@ ing fees and contributions up to emergency notes on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) , the re@@ building of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) . &quot;
&quot; I have not been given a stand@@ still , and I always have added improvements because water is man@@ ned and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their foli@@ age , she praised G@@ öl@@ lers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has lived with much heart blood for its water @-@ purpose association , and he has been fighting the water @-@ purpose association , as it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he served as a real practition@@ er for the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ al Group to nit@@ rate , before the Water Forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
he has received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller be on the one hand praised water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked for 28 years with him .
he is the best water@@ way and he was a loyal Kn@@ appe .
together we were a unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlights from his perspective , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the purpose of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult deployment were the bur@@ s@@ quar@@ ry at the edge of the church , on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night , so the settlements with water could be looked after . &quot;
the supply of new brun@@ n can be kept once more because one filled the floods of P@@ ett@@ stadt with du@@ cks .
&quot; the management of the pot@@ able water @-@ purpose Association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the Aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and is addressed to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made great progress , &quot; said the 44 year old in the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the disease has been recognized by her son , they believed they had to die . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the eigh@@ ty @-@ year old Ti@@ ago has come forward and learn privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; in order to give an example : if I ask him something for two years , when I sang at the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko . &quot;

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shooting at life @-@ companion
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 and fatal .
&quot; the man himself called by us and said to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; &quot; said a police officer . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator may be on the run , after him become openly enlighten@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the way by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown burnt and has a glass . &quot;
by now the police has released a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the man carries a g@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry out the weapon with themselves , so the police force . &quot;
&quot; who Sven S. sees , is supposed to call 110 . &quot;
the police speaks of an association relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck did not want to make no information about the di@@ ather@@ mark , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a human being killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ ct , a T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more , &quot; &quot; said a pol@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ acher in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command unit ( SEK ) was the crime scene . &quot;
steel - light outlook for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ exploited and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green electricity funding , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; during the liberation of the renewable energies plant in the production facilities for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Own production in the German Steel Industries , &quot; Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , &quot; &quot; West German general newspaper &quot; &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really happy that we finally reached the negotiations after two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to ask steel manufacturers to ask gases from the high @-@ furnace power generation to ask for their own consumption . &quot;
the steel industry threatened additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German industry industry .
&quot; Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , which is now an agreement with the EU Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators be replaced in the steel plants , an EEG conversion rate of 20 percent fall into the steel case . &quot;
but this will not be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall had welcomed the European Commission &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for its Own production .
&quot; thus , the status quo will largely be established in the current regulation . &quot;
a special meaning have the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel , future &quot; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot;
&quot; although the reform of the emissions of emissions are climate and employment objectives , IG Metall chief Jörg Hofmann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry is suffering under over@@ capacities and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest producer in China in view of the weak demand for large steel on the world market . &quot;
European Manufac@@ turers throw Chinese steel concerts in price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for one show the import duties on imp@@ ending steel , for others , the economic outlook in China have applied . &quot;
&quot; un@@ clear , how sustainable is the over@@ h@@ aul . &quot;
the German industry Pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp stayed c@@ auti@@ ously on Thursday .
&quot; finally , prices would rather stag@@ n@@ ated . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp recently wanted to exclu@@ de cl@@ ut@@ ations of single works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , approximately 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite increasing rates and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; they produced a total of 3.4 million tonnes , and six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the steel Society of Steel on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief increase in May , the amount brought back to the second consecutive month . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is reduced by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects an increasing output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , health : sing pra@@ ises to seniors &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has accompanied her whole life : as young girl accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the course of study , she reserved the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old is singing in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total of living , she says . &quot;
very next to her health and spirit is doing something good .
&quot; today , S@@ ingen is a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most senior citizens sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; by regular cooperation , senior citizens can connect social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; because frequently , social and familiar structures exist in the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; &quot; sit down and organize . we can rely on the others and learn of each other - a choir is a very special form of gathering . &quot;
&quot; sing in the positive sense can be st@@ res@@ s@@ ful , means H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
a deep and controlled re@@ spiration are practicing .
&quot; whoever asks his lung regularly , is not so fast in everyday life either . &quot;
&quot; even though it comes to maintain the sound of voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German labor community of the senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is frequently observed that singing or listening of songs in older people w@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to lyrics and especially melo@@ dies , people themselves de@@ fun@@ ct themselves to long @-@ present events . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the singing , a special performance is demanded , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , at the same time , concentrate on their own voice and to adapt to another rhythm - this is a large cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people , who live alone , can not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em grows through the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show itself : if I do long for something , I &apos;ll get better and watch over me - this experience &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means to have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who is there when a sound goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; someone sings from the friend of a senior ench@@ ant@@ or , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or the Church leader . &quot;
many senior citizens can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , can ask the family , friends or neighbors , for help with the Internet . &quot;
&quot; those who want to sing , should not be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; singing the soul well , and has something free - this is true for every age . &quot;
cats react sensiti@@ vely as a cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of young animals
&quot; Bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , which the effect of cat @-@ bab@@ ys have grown on adult animals . &quot;
&quot; in their surprise , the males suffer no cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always . &quot;
female cats may recognize the rainy level of cat @-@ bab@@ ys at the mi@@ dd@@ ling of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens who chose to be in great distress , such as scientists from the Medical School and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; anyway , K@@ ater also react to the Ru@@ bs of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between less and heavily poll@@ uted young for the males either is either perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; the biolog@@ ist Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H said . &quot;
&quot; she is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kit@@ ten @-@ scre@@ y with the drums of their help is different . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult cr@@ aters were observed in a total of nine adults and eight cycles of the MH@@ H animal hus@@ band@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; some of them were previously pre@@ played , taken for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in addition to others , they were confron@@ ted with scre@@ ams of more powerful k@@ itt@@ ens which were elevated in addition . &quot;
&quot; the researchers keep their results , despite the low sample of the sample . &quot;
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring , did react differenti@@ ated on the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speaker when this ru@@ ff of the very rainy kit@@ ten played .
this ability may be an@@ born or developed by gender .
&quot; a surprise was that the males had re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women are sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski won with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ch@@ r . &quot;
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ fo Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; already with the suspension of acceptance in July , after the overthrow of the revolution in July , the government , the daily life of norm@@ ality should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected to participate in the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len movement that is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
it is not done before the football team .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ l@@ r .
&quot; in the meantime , South @-@ cows are accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ch@@ r is to be responsible for the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; the first thing for 90 days is considered to be the first of the exceptional circumstances until October , but in fact , this has the life of most Turks , but as good as no effects . &quot;
the night &quot; democracy @-@ Wa@@ chen &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for the end of the country .
&quot; the sport is , as the whole country - split in tra@@ ilers and opponent of Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
especially fans of labour clubs Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
&quot; but in view of the Turks during the dramatic experience in the story , the strict de@@ jection of military p@@ aches is weeping . &quot;
there &apos;s even the fans even so - whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ winning &quot; Gala &quot; will arrive especially again on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
&quot; its sporty value presented the Cologne in the past season , with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first play as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against fen@@ ders he scored 1 : 0 victory .
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered it : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he has completed the season on an outstanding way and secured the trop@@ hy of his team .
&quot; thanks &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the dis@@ appointing year for the record champion took an reconc@@ iled conclusion . &quot;
after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League tell the &quot; lions &quot; in the Europa League early .
&quot; in the south of Li@@ g , there was only to rank six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the trop@@ hy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski said . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the game was better . &quot;
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who finished with 26 seasonal season as the South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ sho@@ ok the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the 31 year old .
&quot; in this case , the AC @-@ Florence had announced the signing and announced at Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , who would only be posted to the coup attempt to do not return because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; when Mario wants to come to us , he has to say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; Club Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Stür@@ mer would have to be willing to aband@@ on some one @-@ third of its estimated 7.5 million euros estimated to be an estimated annual salary : &quot; its salary at Florence is not able to pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 year old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ c in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others led athle@@ tics @-@ sin@@ ner may have to laugh about it - they fight in Rio around medals .
D@@ oping &apos;s theme determines the headlines from the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who compl@@ ained their start to play after a d@@ oping lock , was fl@@ ashed out and spread out at their start ( 100 meters of breast ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a quir@@ ky scene : with a wre@@ cked smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her performance . &quot;
&quot; as noted that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a p@@ ub@@ el@@ op . &quot;
&quot; yet , there are numerous other athletes who go to the start at the Rio Olympics in Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m Season / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked for two times because of d@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its year the Olympic champion in 2004 and Ex @-@ world champion is even faster than ever , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the largest ch@@ allen@@ er of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the pain of the pain of Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had a strong dent@@ al@@ ot , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship were tested positive on the prohibited stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the knowledge and was closed for six months .
the four worst lit@@ ters in this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ it@@ in .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic and two @-@ time world champion was over 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and has been locked 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means to increase penis enlargement may be responsible , mo@@ cked Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
I@@ wan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were subsequently recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his world championship title of nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave the Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ oping and the EM @-@ title 2006 due to testosterone abuse .
&quot; due to a verdict of the 2008 Olympic Games , the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ uler of the 2008 Olympic Games was also accepted . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ran@@ kings .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ it@@ in was first tested in May , but may still be launched in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references was found on taking a forbidden food supplements by found the sperm of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran out on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ arians in Thailand - Austrian - multiple deaths
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ öll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she suffered from chi@@ ves and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
her return journey was planned for early September .
&quot; whether of the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern towns of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on , Austrian citizens are still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in contact with the local authorities , so bar@@ bell . &quot;
&quot; at the distance of 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai national and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , another two explo@@ it@@ ments went high , another man was killed by the authorities . &quot;
&quot; by Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explo@@ de was reported in the early morning . &quot;
&quot; at the Det@@ onation near the popular bathing beach Pat@@ ong , Pat@@ ong was injured as a taxi driver . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded by a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ res had gone into the air according to the authorities of the territory of the coast . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g called on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on at the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; you go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , whose name was it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks bear the same manuscript , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai Crit@@ eri@@ ee Friday night up to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it was too early to express themselves to possible moti@@ ves , but probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to realize a pattern which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; however , the Thai police declared that terrorist attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist movement , or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , I think that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , authorities have received secret critics on the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact date and the places were informed . &quot;
&quot; still , be un@@ clear , which group is stuck behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police arrested its officials throughout the country to rein@@ force security around the major government buildings , as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area . &quot;
&quot; there are always minor bomb attacks in Thailand , but they usually do not stand against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ id@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after reason @-@ to @-@ end bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is advis@@ able to make the instructions of Thai security agencies in its homepage . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ xen and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; according to disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim population , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
elevated security risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
a few days after a controversial referendum held by the military jun@@ ta held a few days after a controversial referendum .
this gives a great influence of the military in the coming years .
&quot; jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said , the bombs had been an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos while the country turns stability , an improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had taken hold of power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , holding itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , it has not been managed to get the military in the outer south of the country since years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot;
nearly one year ago in Bangkok at a attack on a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
the rights &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is advised in the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional protection .
&quot; after several regional offices , the Constitutional Court also submitted a group of observation as well . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; anom@@ ali@@ es for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitutional Affairs Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ am@@ aged in extrem@@ ist manner . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; Ident@@ ity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; she turns against &quot; &quot; multic@@ ul@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of its own identity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Court in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority appe@@ aled to the decision at the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; ident@@ ities of Ident@@ ity &apos; try to collect their target group , where she stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts attempt to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the would Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
that is not an ad@@ mitt@@ ent advertising for their own cause .
propaganda is alleged to speak emot@@ ionally .
young people are due especially in particular .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports of several federal states concerning contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; on African policies . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the Constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant to certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - through certain people who are extrem@@ ist , changes its target and is extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; so , this means that such persons are heading towards the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with regard to the significant increase of rectangular criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee leaders , Ma@@ ate said he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be well , that further legal @-@ terrorism groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee sh@@ ei@@ me or attacks from other right @-@ wing templates . &quot;
but a German @-@ wide or Europe @-@ wide control of law@@ suit was not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; the previous groups were created on the regional level , or in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many attacks on the account of people went missing previously not in the right scene . &quot;
that is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
many of the susp@@ ect in attacks on asylum should not be known as criminal investig@@ ating politically motivated criminal off@@ ender or followers of the right scene .
&quot; so many people have committed crimes committed by the right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which had perhaps elected politically in@@ different or for example CDU , SPD or Left , which was then radic@@ alised by right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records the headlines in the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros with the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly floating s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could not see any more in television pictures .
he van@@ ished - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became a viral interest . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a return of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather its not a sporty figure that attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old does not participate in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub@@ ju@@ gated countries .
&quot; as in Equ@@ th@@ op@@ ia , most athletes want to run , Hab@@ te wanted to make something different . &quot;
preparation is all ready : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media recorded it as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL der W@@ al . &quot;
the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny about him as well .
&quot; his time , he only took part in a minute and almost five seconds above the 100 meters Fre@@ estyle , played no role here . &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care for media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the gig of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a run over 100 meters of free style . &quot;
fr@@ en@@ etic was fired Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the contest .

&quot; with the election to the U.S. president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an Alternative Video . &quot;
he then drive into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , it would be either ill , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not good for him on the end of reasons of political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; so he called the President Barack Obama and the Can@@ didate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within its party , last more resistance formed constantly . &quot;

the post plans to sell its electric vehicle sco@@ ot@@ ers too .
&quot; in brief , the Group wants to start the trade with the transporter . &quot;

&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and business units from Wel@@ ding ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg will need deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative leader Herbert Schmidt on the body , a new calculation of fees for se@@ wage plant and se@@ wage plant was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , survivors and covers from the previous estimate period are also equal . &quot;
&quot; with all three se@@ wage increases , Schmidt thus established that there are relatively small facilities in all three se@@ wage plants , with a very low se@@ wage plant that fly between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; as a result , due to the low distribution basis , for example , spending of a number of thousand euros would be engraved . &quot;
se@@ wage water is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants .
&quot; furthermore , during all three systems not least because of their age of age and repair expend@@ itu@@ res were not fallen in a considerable extent due to their age . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for world heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced with a failure to repair any damage .
&quot; after almost 20 years old production plants had to be over@@ hau@@ led and the first sep@@ tic pond had to be over@@ taken after almost 20 years , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge disp@@ osed of and an additional ventilation option needed to be able to maintain the water legal requirements . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; for this extraordinary expenditure , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came to take into account in accordance with the new calculations period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still clearly below the current level in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made clear that in the small se@@ wage plant in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs have been sp@@ ared for the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned plants will continue to remain pre@@ dict@@ ated by stone houses on duration , especially since you could not expand the se@@ wage area of the se@@ wage Association , Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al , because they are unable to wi@@ red these plants . &quot;
Bulgaria joins the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October of last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average growth of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in consumption of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1,2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained in the pre@@ mon@@ at of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Effect as Asian caric@@ ature critic@@ ised
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter anim@@ e is inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that there is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , snap@@ chat allows about 150 million daily users to change the reality and to play with ident@@ ities on such a way that borders the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ blo@@ o@@ ded , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million more Beat@@ itudes per day . &quot;
all the errors will arrive to the public .
snap@@ chat @-@ filters have moved in the past criticism in which they were accused of being able to prop@@ agate the App Black@@ face or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week some users found a filter , who gave them sl@@ ot@@ ted , false teeth , and poll@@ uted che@@ eks , called some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow light . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether these repet@@ itive contro@@ versy raised to a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ atility . &quot;
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were dis@@ semin@@ ated on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered a ap@@ ologies : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but outside , it experienced rac@@ ism , remin@@ ded the filter to viol@@ ate c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other refused to decide the Ani@@ me comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace as@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American student of Korean , whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos that the filter was viol@@ ently viol@@ ently and mil@@ dly un@@ pleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very griev@@ ous Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not secured , but that the yel@@ lowing of yellow has been pulled into down@@ stream extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dens@@ ation and integration of integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in the hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - those in the race di@@ vers@@ er than their older counter@@ players - could be expected to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters is a picture created for a user , so it &apos;s much more difficult to remain as it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account to er@@ ase your Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set @-@ up for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that she &apos;s belief @-@ related contro@@ versy sur@@ faced a lack of di@@ vers@@ ities in snap@@ shots at snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either she does not have any representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions , in which they are safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is largely un@@ answered . &quot;
&quot; the company does not publish figures for the diversity of its workforce , and points to its status as private companies . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his collabor@@ ators , but according to a speaker , the company recently focused a personnel responsible , based on the sub@@ mar@@ ital population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu told her that she will leave her Snap@@ chat account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership extingu@@ ish ISIS intelligence information , exhibits Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel related to the United States Central Command @-@ related information to mark a optimi@@ stic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , reported an investig@@ ative committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ites , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction under Central Command intelligence services that changed their ass@@ ess@@ ments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news service information , which were typically applied by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ part@@ ments , were regularly allowed to have a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as it was permitted to have a positive analysis of other news services , quoted as a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer , when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the guide error in Cent@@ Com are suff@@ ice to top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows a detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government peaks on Obama has given instructions to change reviews , shows how analysts say the pressure of their fore@@ laws , a optimi@@ stic image of the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements before Congress were clearly positive than the facts &quot; presented the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , an Cent@@ Com was publicly known that a military recovery of the Mos@@ ulate might begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , this is much clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can convention from Kansas , said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the peak of Central Command changed the possibility to play down the danger by ISIS through ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after them , analysts were worried about the mani@@ pulation of reports about Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; published on Thursday , the report will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General Secretary of Defense . &quot;
&quot; the democratic members of Intelligence , published their own findings on Thursday , agreed with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 Cent@@ Com showed an excessive limited process for the preparation of trend @-@ based ass@@ ess@@ ments on Isi@@ l and Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest democr@@ at democr@@ at in the Ministry of Represent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Ship , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent news reports , &quot; &quot; mor@@ ates the mor@@ ale of analysts and , &quot; gave a little space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Ship and Democrats stated that there were no indications of the White House in Cent@@ Com Analy@@ ses , regarding a &quot; given political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the Pentagon reported by the Pentagon &apos;s general agent following complaints by Cent@@ Com Analy@@ est . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ Fly . Patrick Evans , a press brie@@ fing of the Pentagon , gave no reports that the Ministry of Defence would not be comment on the conference , while the investigations of the General Inspec@@ tion were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ verg@@ ent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigation on the question of a successful aviation campaign among American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alleg@@ ation which has now been made by a growing number of relatives of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year , however , has the question to be said that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest in@@ ass@@ ess@@ ments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the en@@ vy of the Islamic state remin@@ ded over the Islamic state of more than ten years ago when an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a script of how the then government under George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts at the outcome of the invasion of 2003 over the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team used to establish Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to the government statement , that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the terrorist state , there were no significant impact on the financial statements of the terrorist group because this pro@@ vis@@ ite refin@@ eries had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ aging command in Chief , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legisl@@ ature due to its superior positive assessment of war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin was retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Britain before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , this does not know : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are the same in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remains unbe@@ aten in Japan after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will take up on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will achieve the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
&quot; the first place is going to run a little longer from the path , which lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game will go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising f@@ uss about four years after the past London games played at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ cket in hands ( their two older sisters played sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a National Team of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; they missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , because they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which for them and their team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a body change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the working time in London that we have now .
we have all able to ri@@ p the ru@@ der .
on Thursday evening b@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a retreat from the se@@ am area .
&quot; India had gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the player from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with a flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball into the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans for a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will be on Saturday from the result of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are too late . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro prepar@@ es constantly and inev@@ it@@ ably , a Ras@@ ender Staff@@ ell@@ on between competition and str@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which is served by the wrist@@ bands for the tri@@ athletes , for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t listen to the television , read a paper or listen to your neighbor in the Wart@@ es@@ hop , without saying about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ap , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there &apos;s Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples , could well be sent to Prime Time , if he had a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real would be . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade , the sports , which are not generally acknowledged : air pist@@ ol shoot , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I am modest , make arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me leave the attention to the discre@@ et charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years was so po@@ int@@ ently perceived that many that had questioned I didn &apos;t know that it is a Olympic port@@ art . &quot;
that could be the regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA athletes sent to the competition , it never won a medal in trampoline jumping and succeeded in 2012 with a athletes who managed it to the final round . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men , the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women . &quot;
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ si@@ der , partly because it sounds for the un@@ locked ear suitable for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule as the ideal for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a few enthusiasm . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ ors of his never to end up - but also the Gra@@ zie of gy@@ mna@@ stics and tau@@ rine , which combines two sports , which essentially un@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much as &quot; jumps . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jump vic@@ tor jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before they landing at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad , you will be rated for execution , difficulty level and time . &quot;
&quot; two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts hop@@ ed in their quest for gold further , qu@@ icker , up to the finish , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes go and back , up and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
they are not only ch@@ ase the finishing line or the output wall but also in television transmission also another pol@@ em@@ ic goal : the world or the Olympi@@ ad records .
&quot; the targeted pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic , and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but this is what I feel at watching this games as a bit tired .
this trampoline offers an at@@ ric acid .
the V@@ ektor of the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ spr@@ inger is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly heavy ho@@ ist like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up after , then effort@@ lessly gradually . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the practice there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no cur@@ b to the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualifying and final rounds of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming of 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will broadcast the En@@ dr@@ o as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 to 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by anxiety and the object of male athletes , as it struck the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air rin@@ gency , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , one ally of the United States &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators call for political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gling to violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that the protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police .
is Ethiopia straight together ?
&quot; in the past ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid board of West Africa with a fast @-@ growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the past few months , protests against the government and the territory expanded steadily . &quot;
last week thousands of people fell on streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
&quot; witnesses gave witness that polic@@ emen shot on an armed fire , killed and killed . &quot;
&quot; in circulation , videos about protests , probably from the last or early of this year , show how security forces were to beat young people with sticks , while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights requires an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to collect this country and in future it will even become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa , and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , particularly in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded its pace in the pace .
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new P@@ end@@ ler@@ train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even though Ethiopia had everything else than a role for democracy - human rights organisations continued to continue the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dis@@ sidents were committed to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or to prison , or put them into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress People and don &apos;t have any other options except protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; said Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are many complaints , which cover everything from the soil use until dig@@ ging in relation to power the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition , and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ten@@ sions rise along the border to Erit@@ rea , a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts predi@@ ct that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , were able to benefit from turbul@@ ence and armed forces in recent years . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of the pro@@ vocation after years are now explo@@ ding under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media as cheap smartphones were increasingly more common and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , do many people still communicate on the Internet pro@@ x@@ ies , which hide themselves wherever they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they were gathered so to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since they prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as who come from offices mainly Christian high countries , in politics and economy , while they are exploited O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims live and live in flat areas . &quot;
but this is also changing .
&quot; we are able to co @-@ ordin@@ ate among a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population , and in the military , in the intelligence services , commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in a non @-@ public disease in 2012 , 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was viewed as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly ob@@ tru@@ sive in it , to perceive early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and to use special contra@@ ctors to edit enemy , and to make them harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di said , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ secured reasons to increase the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike the Lord Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiop@@ ian , Mr H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he enjoys not the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections prot@@ ested , according to the claims of analy@@ tics of the government and then stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ icia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and this time of turbul@@ ences went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts pra@@ ising Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their vision@@ aries infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ ite , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in the poverty line . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the internal Miss@@ ing of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month &apos;s protest in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray guided businesses and the hatred for the Tig@@ ray will always be held in social media . &quot;
analysts predi@@ ct that protests and other Western allies bring to such a position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ los over the neighboring Somalia , even if she ha@@ sted that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West will definitely want to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to merge his ally in a volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin background . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explained his asser@@ tion Obama ISIS was founded &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ versy on Friday the last contro@@ versy sur@@ passed his campaign , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would not have been the &quot; founder of the terrorist group of Islamic State , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication fell to the communication skills of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate comprehen@@ sible and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his mit@@ es to make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase of protection , to explain in the pec@@ uli@@ ar position , which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the clari@@ fication at a campaign events held on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the asser@@ tion of Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really didn &apos;t intend to indicate that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning Twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the republi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
the last storm of criticism puts down on Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to draw the focus of its campaign due to in@@ dem@@ nity over the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speech@@ es on the Michigan economic situation in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue . &quot;
&quot; commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ics would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he drew strong criticism of himself when he thought that Russians should chop up Mrs. Clin@@ ics &apos;s Ema@@ ils , but later he said &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then go back to rowing .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans as they arrive , and then , if appropriate , &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication experts , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his testimony , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ened the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump received an even corro@@ sive sound since its circum@@ ference has declined . &quot;
&quot; a new pol@@ l of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he is accused of mis@@ chief his critics or mis@@ understanding his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he has strengthened the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow in the un@@ comfortable situation to be independent of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may be his testimony . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent princip@@ als , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called his back@@ ben@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government is under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton used as Foreign Minister , it allowed to spread it to spread the situation in the Middle East is aggressive under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them away on each of his words and bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the Democrats sp@@ at over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use , as only another evidence that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office . &quot;
&quot; once more about the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a fo@@ aming café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where one could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had good coffee for 15 years . &quot;
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was pushed .
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business , which replaced Ver@@ b in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
they were ro@@ oted as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is changing , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , it is re@@ inv@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened the last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
&quot; he began working in Ver@@ b in 2001 , and remained there until the end . &quot;
&quot; as a customer offered a customer to prepare money for a new external office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment also .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are natural re@@ iss@@ ants .
&quot; the café does not serve any beer , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ oned stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also overcome by Willi@@ am@@ sburg prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take her way . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she spent a while the Kaffe@@ etr@@ inken ab@@ ines , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the Ver@@ b , which liked me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a further long@@ time and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went in front of work and ordered forever .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss fo@@ b watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , eggs and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he did not catch a gar@@ bage that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie made a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of coffee cafes . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go down to their offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has been translated into Polish and Rodri@@ guez , and Rodri@@ guez said that he will soon ask her to make her new neighbors . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally want to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding into a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was regular , and said that he was destroyed by the ground , when the café was closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the location of the Lok@@ as and the Order felt a new coffee like a return . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as f@@ oo@@ dies , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was something modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as a dessert a pl@@ um p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both Food historian .
Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was inspired by the Chinese cuisine in the US while brick in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective .
&quot; their newest cooperation , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrated the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , s@@ cour@@ ge I@@ mb@@ iss in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh aff@@ ection@@ ate with olive trees while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable . &quot;
&quot; as the reporter min@@ ced ground , this couple found a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
there were pean@@ ut bread , liver che@@ eses and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient .
&quot; imagine , so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as a dinner . &quot;
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have been placed in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cook for male ri@@ ves and it was served freshly baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans that were sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country went with it to be no longer the s@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans became a central , shared theme , &quot; beg@@ ged Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ bility : mysterious dishes such as bre@@ ads and k@@ asser@@ tion were found too stap@@ le food , the K@@ asser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful kind , food waste &quot; &quot; noticed Z@@ iegel@@ man , because co@@ oks could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was the heart of the American kitchen for years , was too rare . &quot;
&quot; such mix@@ tures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nutriti@@ ous satisfaction of the prec@@ e@@ dence over taste or even healthy food was understood . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also comprises recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the household items .
&quot; as ever before or since then , business economics - among them Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by creating recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; &quot; bud@@ get@@ ol@@ iti@@ ful &quot; &quot; and the challenge , P@@ amp@@ e like creamy Sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to transform . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al , &quot; is a feast of historical treats . &quot;
especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s answer to the hungry citizens such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me cake @-@ food post@@ ure .
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Io@@ wa farmhouse in his kitchen , he sp@@ ei@@ sts like the million@@ th man of the world to which he became . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a almost gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was a great surprise .
&quot; President Roosevelt could perhaps have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to equi@@ p a post@@ mark with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the owner of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mr@@ s Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial meal prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , going to deal with food was rejected , once the country came back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , &quot; says Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot;
&quot; the couple announced in writing the book the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans in law to have better understood - for example , how they could not throw it away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ man rec@@ alled : &quot; people actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ breaking case .
&quot; after the plates were vac@@ ated at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s dishes , they stri@@ pped and cook a dessert they cooked at home : the pl@@ au@@ ght , the President Roosevelt ate in lunch . &quot;
&quot; it will be called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name . &quot;
&quot; there was no proposed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ pped somewhat against a spoon into the fence , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E scored three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ ers , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life in the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a Fass@@ bom@@ ben attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil society group , which had to almost 60,000 people lost their lives according to the image newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 29@@ 00 volunteers place their own life into the game to attract people from the bom@@ bed houses , and to afford first aid in the war zone . &quot;
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Society , showing him a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians to the lumin@@ ous symbol in the horror of war .
&quot; as heroes , he never saw himself as heroes , said : &quot; for me it is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God looks into a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar fell victim to an attack , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia District , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the po@@ ison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb so that no children play with it , &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the fatal bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Green@@ land@@ hai : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland will usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland won only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ ure@@ ly floating in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it has just 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to it , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates at a range of 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
but this lon@@ el@@ iness of lon@@ el@@ iness seems to be a god@@ ept for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; from a Greenland , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock this lif@@ esp@@ an , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist presum@@ ed too long , that Greenland will become stone . &quot;
only the evidence was lacking .
&quot; Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks are hard to watch , and they live mainly in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s lifestyle .
&quot; her tim@@ ber@@ pent@@ emp@@ o lim@@ bs them , when they played six animals in front of S@@ val@@ bard , with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; this shar@@ ks still make this shar@@ ks : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another one had swallowed up the j@@ aw bone of a young polar bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the iron ore and looking for cad@@ aver that tor@@ ches from higher water layers after bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the biggest 502 @-@ cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , it is analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the shar@@ k core of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of shar@@ ks , that would not be renewed in the proteins . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore be in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as atomic attempts to under@@ go larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; with 220 centi@@ metres in length of the smallest animal , the Lin@@ sen@@ core contained a minor excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all larger herds of Greenland had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ centi@@ meters long Greenland was a age of 335 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Grön@@ land@@ hai females then get offspring when they are over four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to arrange an old age .
&quot; due to one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters long at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland &apos;s shar@@ ks with the increase of at least one and a half times a time . &quot;
this is likely to be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; such meth@@ us@@ al ema , especially in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , stuck in his bacon in the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was captured in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures frequently , animals of the living animals are often living on spar@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; so they mature , later - and slower slower . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface due to which the animal eats heat .
the heat loss of 1 gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; thus , a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on focusing on as early as many descendants as early as possible , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; however , a very big animal should have invested its resources in a long life . &quot;
building material in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the municipal council in the most recent session has been foc@@ uss@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; with relief relief , the panel included the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven home b@@ als can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the basic plot , par@@ ap@@ ture and final questions are clari@@ fied and the applications were submitted to the sale of plots in the residential area &quot; &quot; street road &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - Section 1 ) . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers inside the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families and gl@@ ancing senior citizens alike speak equally .
&quot; as it was said , building permit can be cons@@ ul@@ ted immediately in the Town Hall , on the submission of the plots is expected to be advised in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to settle requests for further business companies , joined the creation of work@@ places , the Municipal Council decided to change the planning stage in part of this year in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ tim@@ ec@@ n , this is already proven by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city will be the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Compet@@ ence Financial Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes can continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport , the approval in the UK has so far . &quot;
that is just great US banks .
&quot; several banks have already announced , jobs to leave jobs . &quot;
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for the monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro zone , as well as other important authorities as the European insurance view of E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk provisions . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) agreed to its head@@ quarter , but this is less significant for the financial sector . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank@@ note is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg there is a large fund industry , but also like Dublin at the infrastructure worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
furthermore the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for top @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer stand the city on No.@@ 7 , Luxemburg , place 33 , Dublin on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if life of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors as well as the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the x@@ ite vote . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , in London , there were about 14@@ 4,000 people working in the banking industry in the end of 2015 , and in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 people . &quot;
Gilead receives legal cost from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. official judge decided that Gilead &apos;s Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal cost , which you created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was liberated from a damages amounting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medicines of Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead after a U.S. Jud@@ ges covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; at the complaint lodged on Thursday , U.S. National advoc@@ ate Beth Sh@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead are entitled to the expense of the cost , which were created during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to escal@@ ate with Gilead , the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck def@@ endants and Mer@@ ck def@@ endants and property work on lab works of which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r agreed , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) flow after the extract of the remaining group of fighters , which have dug within the city , currently under@@ min@@ ed the city . &quot;

Clin@@ ton earn 10.4 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the population .
&quot; Hillary Clinton published their tax declar@@ ations for 2015 on Friday , these resulted for the presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ t USD 1 million donated for char@@ itable uses primarily to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated revenues of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster , and their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax expl@@ ain@@ ment of the last ten years . &quot;
you paid an effective Swiss tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s struggle against Jennifer Pal@@ er@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hi@@ des behind mis@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation and returns to his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
it is common to publish their tax declar@@ ations for US presidential candidate although they are not obliged by law .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have reported as a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps , Special Advisor to CNN , said that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish some before tax tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already proven that his ref@@ us@@ al issues in relation to assets , its donations for char@@ itable organizations , its business partners and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton over@@ threw himself on the subject and released a video on the Internet , in which the senior rep@@ ublic@@ ans can release his tax statement . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke the topic even during a speech to the economy in Michigan . &quot;
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the past decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid for two years or only very little tax , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax ev@@ il@@ ations and tax advis@@ ors that could still be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ taxes have become a topic in election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a control which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren , which would ensure that people earn more than USD 1 million to pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ek@@ on@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat to exchange Tr@@ ump into a meeting with their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ets said he was also subjected to a control test of the IRS as well as &quot; &quot; anxiety &quot; &quot; before the voters and not before the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax declar@@ ations , up until 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the Clin@@ ics , now in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , live in average an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax Declaration of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that this is only USD 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main source of money was a cost @-@ cost index fund , from which the dividend divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

Jewish Director proposes the Berlin Hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; claim - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media watch after he has betra@@ yed the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , because it has been requested by a staff according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; sent his trouble at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his final stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country rank@@ ings list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel recep@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel noted that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels .
&quot; the reason , behind it , triggered even more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre@@ fix will be deleted , the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung .
we were horri@@ fied by this event and seas@@ oned .
that is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has worn in precisely this property chain , is even a even greater dis@@ grace . &quot;
no explanation requires that .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident dissolved a fairly large response to the Internet , in which people called it a scandal . &quot;
some signed the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given the alleged petition of an Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; sh@@ amed you , &quot; &quot; said it in another post which was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all of the accus@@ ations and called the incident &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; with Lanz@@ mann , reported Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there has never been a direct instruction , &quot; Israel did not record in the high @-@ list list , quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police force Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke against protest@@ ant Brazilian students
&quot; students beat together during the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , together with the police , when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ esch@@ ke against the protest@@ ers .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers attempted to deal with the students that led to the police rubber fin and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their aspir@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students are to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ers looked at Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional pre@@ sidents of Michel T@@ emer &apos;s walls .
&quot; the most recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators in masses on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been suspended from the office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rise to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; raising the sanctions grew according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ in D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison , by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew sharply in businesses in the country , divided by the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies assume existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to get access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further trade is one of the greatest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan said . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran , in the first five months of 2016 , increased by 7@@ 0.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; trade swing was reached by ship@@ ments of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan dates back to a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign representatives of around 35,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel agents travel to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in Russia , as the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record number of Irish tourists in Russia last year , will be broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social @-@ ped@@ agog@@ ical daily group / social group work of children &apos;s protection against their summer vac@@ ancy in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; quietly located in the quiet neighborhood , the life @-@ free group was qu@@ ered during the first school week of school week . &quot;
several all day trips are focused on the program .
&quot; for one , it went to Britt@@ any with the visit of the string . &quot;
&quot; to the other , Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s leadership in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group settled down at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; culinary were children and car@@ et@@ akers with their own preparations like the Saudi @-@ corro@@ sive , the Se@@ eb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ nese . &quot;
&quot; made in workshops , made of beautiful je@@ wels made of pearls and stones created or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings on the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te Night . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of hom@@ ebo@@ und , the sun and the children and adolescents returned home . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : fung@@ us to the gateway of mercy
the minist@@ rants from the seaf@@ ar@@ ers of Ey@@ oc@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch &apos;s St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were handled . &quot;
&quot; in order to transfer the period to the next few years of the pilgrimage to all the minist@@ rants in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial Round of St. Anna decided to prepare a multi @-@ day pilgrimage hike . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ m aims was checked and we finally decided to finally decided to commem@@ orate the Bish@@ ops city of Freiburg , where in this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year &apos;s mercy on the open doors of Charity , a special fung@@ us was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ al bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern rose on the way . &quot;
&quot; on the evening , the parish priest sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the fung@@ us and divided the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , one was driven by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Mu@@ ch Bel@@ oved woman , and so the pilgrimage was driven out of Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were flan@@ ked in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short stimul@@ us with various prayers , songs and written documents . &quot;
&quot; but on the way , the Min@@ is made to cross @-@ crossing , chap@@ els or churches , in order to sing together a song from stand @-@ formed pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , a par@@ ch@@ ment of the local paths were available . &quot;
on the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ iel@@ en Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty and stronger dinner and breakfast .
further on the second day we went to G@@ üt@@ enbach on the second day .
&quot; tags that emerged in the stage to St. Peter , which was the exhau@@ sting road route , however , had to beat down about 500 metres of altitude and then van@@ ished again . &quot;
the reward was a dinner in the evening in the evening .
&quot; after the dawn of the fourth pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter , it went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in this late afternoon , the Min@@ is met in the Frei@@ burger Münster in late afternoon and stepped through the doors of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse there was thanks to God .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is owned by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to view the vest@@ ry and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ze metropolis .
&quot; in the afternoon , it went back to Hor@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ ks at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
&quot; Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner &apos;s ra@@ ste last night in the Män@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame , when British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor of his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y as he stor@@ med the legend when he stor@@ med home to a victory from the favorite New Zealand .
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ ag@@ old@@ medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after being held in March at the track World Championships in London , despite the back@@ rest of Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a Hin@@ des .
Ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man when they remained , when they saw potential in the vill@@ i , which now un@@ folds . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y winner - and S@@ kin@@ ner put in the Quali@@ fication Round a Olympi@@ ad , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ ens the New Zealand prevailed in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des was just short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and S@@ kin@@ ner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a large part of the transformation made at the execution of a higher gear , to slow him down and it Kenn@@ y and above all S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at the BBC expert on his position as a BBC expert and fell to S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they rose to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up a Olympic ord and defe@@ ats the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the side Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was Hin@@ des to turn off after a weak start . &quot;
he moved this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion of England rival .
there was no such problem with such an over@@ lap victory for this time .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels like the whole GB flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
&quot; we are so bad for so many world titles , so that it was unbelievable to win the Olympi@@ ad again . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation who won 7 of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a Bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ o@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form Kenn@@ ys , it is possible in the realm of possible that he repeated Ho@@ ys win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster was born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cage of Ho@@ y is equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int , who will start today and will go over three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
&quot; it feels something to win , alone . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des said : &quot; if he wins two additional gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ zed competition of the day , but there was another good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ ve Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified for the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition at the Wig@@ gins with safety in the focus .
&quot; yesterday , he had disputed among the qualification before the qualification , when officials called , to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the tomorrow continued and finished , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie will be held in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is looking forward to domin@@ ate his strong railway team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a flock of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were gone for the Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ ums played in the background as the resignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and mix@@ ers as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than the legendary call GB@@ S , which has reached the perfect moment its peak is repeated . &quot;
&quot; future of the melting of Portland , due to the repe@@ al of the energy contract &quot;
&quot; the future of aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , since the system operator will termin@@ ate the energy contract , and thus deliver all shipping contracts , such as the supplier of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies will be awarded to the plant . &quot;
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years is scheduled for November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Portland , stand on the game . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 jobs , direct and indirect - could be at a closure risk . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ate because the melting plant consumes around 10 per cent of the total electricity generation of Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
&quot; the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money , ris@@ ky a cl@@ ung . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years long spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollars and last@@ ly due to the current price for the facility . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melting plant with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ li@@ Valley , told that three more owners will be announced . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity through the melt means &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L still said that the contracts so @-@ called &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; &quot; should come into force starting in November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month cancellation deadline that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; thus , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenue , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it had already written the value of contracts at the amount of $ 187 million in the amount of dis@@ miss@@ al .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; ability of Alco@@ hol ... to operate the melt or use the power supply to the melt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the US company said that it had concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation , why it came back from the contract . &quot;
&quot; due to the bad economic conditions of the industry , analysts at the possible closure of Portland melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility in the vicinity of Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 600 mega@@ watts and has approximately 900 mega@@ watts of electricity annually . &quot;
both systems should disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; current market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as power generators , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
more than just a caravan of reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue &quot;

&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this Co@@ vers to wines , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s like ? ) , forget the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as well as in the presence of their sister , and that ends with a classic turn : they have all have a surprise @-@ party . &quot;

&quot; with regard to the September issue of Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls Great Sister Kim likes her to have sm@@ itten the Vog@@ ue cover ( she and her husband Kan@@ ye West stayed on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vog@@ ue the most sold edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles rather a picture @-@ band as a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , among the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 615 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the dis@@ closure of his Co@@ ver@@ stars will be anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still le@@ aked in front of the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;

&quot; in 2013 , Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ ation Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; Break@@ through model &quot; of its generation - under the former category , it is located in good society . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or young people from today that know how to twist a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if it applies to J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are interested in entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once published on the last cover had appeared with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers do not like everyone .
&quot; with its reality @-@ TV history , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position was always somewhat ten@@ se in the fashion world . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Model Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues called Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called them &quot; the Mist@@ akes of the eye . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ves back up when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .
but at the mi@@ sm@@ ut ride seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is available on the cover of the September issue of Vog@@ ue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising to your Grun@@ dig of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures from themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall Apps .
she sells from her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LO@@ VE .
and in their leisure time it is visible in reality TV . presumably only to see their sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; community centres show around 16@@ 0,000 people every year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid , more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country will be dismissed annually from the community centre , while the industry had the impact on further medium cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - were dismissed on free legal advice and legal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; legal services to the municipality , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centers are expected to lose more than 30 percent of their federal agents . &quot;
&quot; at Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , the General Assembly of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the national council of community centres revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse , without repe@@ ating the decision of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people of important services that you will need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who have left violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and oppressed debt , families , which have been released by separ@@ ations , workers who can &apos;t get any problems justi@@ fi@@ ably , that they do not need the help you need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will reduce the means by 30 percent , which means that thousands of hel@@ pers should be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice and the sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise these central cuts immediately , so the people who need them will need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the regional government fulfilled their promise to raise funds for legal services on national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of community centres and their clients , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign to be charged when employees were supposed to be a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been indicted for alleged in@@ activity after being informed that their struggle for North Carolina put a gun on a staff in February , while they were travelling on a Jeep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed in Charlotte B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software program for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i was waiting for months to have been waiting for months that the affair would be internally regulated , before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

&quot; after having agreed to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other people had already made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to set damage , &quot; called B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey of the European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4th September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , there are considerable losses for the governing party SPD and CDU . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in representative surveys of opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Pictures &quot; &quot; ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; during the red @-@ black government coalition in the north , it is not possible according to the cargo values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to continue their head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was just slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left side down to 19 per cent ( previously 18.@@ 4 per cent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight loss of 6 percent ( previously , 8.7 percent ) , the Gre@@ ens came back into the state of the country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the German Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD &apos;s SPD voted only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 2@@ 3,4 per cent .
&quot; by doing so , they are still standing behind the green with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( before 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be present at the House of Represent@@ atives with 14 percent for the first time .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to the pirates on the contrary to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; E @-@ Mail and the Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator has come to the market . &quot;
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as difficult as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather pal@@ p@@ tuous . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would be enough for about two Sel@@ bles with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abytes .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers of the devices can buy the devices on the Internet , but they come somehow from the internet era of internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier on the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ ree format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received by fax , also by fax . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible by HTML browser , although tor@@ mented slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be stopped like a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; rather proud was the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
&quot; the average price for a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro , in 2015 . &quot;
nobody could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone division of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , finally sold in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; the market , today , domin@@ ates all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , this is today for many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , global sales with devices is around 400 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app providers and the telecommunic@@ ations convention come . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone now arose a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for the mass market came first at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs did on the Mac @-@ World as the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet Communic@@ ator , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , gave the market to see the market . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after the invention of his invention .
&quot; today , each German only looks at his mobile phone at 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to learn the smartphone even times , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing .
England has to run the Olympic spirit and expand to Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow is not only in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction ever , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions have benef@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
&quot; and that will come back , by setting new opportunities for local resident and firms close to Heathrow . &quot;
&quot; for our local communities we will provide 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London in 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the expansion was too large . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will blo@@ b us on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had in@@ justice in 2012 and they will be wrong at Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to over@@ coming , but Heathrow answered every answer . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heathrow for many and not for single a infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create and a legacy of skills and jobs both at the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow which has implemented a £ 11 billion most expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London Games were a great success for GB and I am confident that the Heathrow Airport will also be one of them .
it is time that we extend this Olympic spirit and expand to Heathrow and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs being proud of England .

Ad@@ block Plus and Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and Maus@@ oleum &quot; regarding display block
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent advertising block , ad block , to work with a &quot; Cat@@ z@@ - and Maus@@ oleum . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertis@@ ements on his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ mail in which it might be able to update their filters in the program again to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ page would change the coding on his advertis@@ ements to detect it , to identify the ad that part of the page advertisement which is part of the page advertising . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to get the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man written by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the an@@ zei@@ ning open source community and the re@@ ins has been underway since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress has been possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has let down social media in the fight , is a strong indication for how to become wor@@ r@@ ying advertis@@ ers for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ ill@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people are advert@@ ised , almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook on their mobile end devices , Hand@@ y@@ advert@@ iser 84 percent of advertising revenue also makes fac@@ ebook . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , as mobile advertising block does not have any effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , divided a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs makes a sufficient big share of revenues , so Facebook will be worth the investment of a pac@@ emaker than worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook told that it would be the &quot; advertisement pre@@ ference &quot; &quot; to have more control over it aimed to have targeted ads . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ ult new filters would be wor@@ r@@ ying because they would also block content on the side that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users that does not represent positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; advertis@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , why we have focused on developing tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman committed suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a highway about several vehicles on a highway in the early morning hours of Thursday . &quot;
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss age at the age of 49 , which was transferred by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative proceedings opened , what a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation is the G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers won &apos;t be drawn to responsibility .
in each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - was decided that the drivers have not going to go out that a pedestrian middle on the highway is going on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ eman was acquitted when they had over@@ ride a man and killed one night at the A1 in the near of Pay@@ erne .
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old sacrifice was drunk , and has become conscious of the street . &quot;
&quot; the Court noted that the polic@@ eman -- which had answered on a justified way -- in a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the street was an &quot; absolutely extraordinary and un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable situation , &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges , should be in the police at the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably able to live according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies in NASA developed an model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms that res@@ emble from climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine if the Venus could have been identified with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once more al@@ lied conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously noted that the slow motion of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have a thin , refresh@@ ed atmosphere , and nevertheless slow down . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet is thought more dry regions than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and shake off faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow motion of Venus run its daily side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds which seems like an umbrella to cover the surface of a lot of sun heating .
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than those of the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought forth a story of Venus , which resem@@ bles the evolution that was suspected earlier by Plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although they were probably inhab@@ itable , the Venus was exposed to much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans are ev@@ ap@@ orated and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect - the Venus , which we know them today . &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led a too low participation in making the teams .
&quot; alternatively , president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as principal coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ acy , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the Trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly ge@@ ared to the organization . &quot;
he also must have a respon@@ sive law with decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who celebrated Roy on May 23 , 2013 , than@@ ked him for his team &apos;s contributions . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy won the winner of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season when the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the association on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and adapted to the after@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
&quot; in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points . &quot;
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two Pi@@ eces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ks oil workers again take talks on , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles concerning the re@@ mun@@ eration of northern overseas workers are exposed , while all the parties have to put together for a new discussion round at the table , negoti@@ ators said . &quot;
strikes against the wood@@ fields of Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the en@@ ite and r@@ ushes unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the winding process of the current dispute , &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will stop some full day meetings in the coming weeks that will start next year to start problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut the rates of its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s coun@@ ties follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts of the company needed the necessary room to come through the market turn .
&quot; Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and plans to give plans to expos@@ e its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ us@@ el@@ ism with the British energy companies BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are based on the lower crude oil prices below pressure , a economic situation , which by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Chamber of Parliament Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders in the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the greatest employers in the North Sea since a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need a economy , which for many and not only for few works , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to spend new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the constellation of the Ple@@ j@@ ades .
&quot; Astr@@ onom@@ ic &apos;s latest mission has helped Astr@@ onom@@ en , the most complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the star@@ base of Ple@@ j@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers understand why stars in stars are rotating at different rates , as well as in which connection the rotation times with the planet Earth stand . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by the same our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his old age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the Star Tre@@ es of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation who were created around 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now taking the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotating rates , these mature stars encounter large amounts of stars . &quot;
&quot; because these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a slow effect to the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is filtered , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each Z@@ odi@@ s by giving the time between the appearance of a recogni@@ zable star @-@ stain@@ s -- like sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; the newest catalog of rotation rates indicates that a more massive stars slower than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ette than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of Ple@@ y@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors are ten@@ ding to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; as the stell@@ ations of the Ple@@ y@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ide@@ ological cosmetic laboratory to compare Stell@@ ar qualities as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ base of Ple@@ j@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot ahead of us what we like to learn more about how the how , when and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ations , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports detailed about their latest analysis of the Ple@@ y@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs

&quot; following its emotional back@@ drop , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will carry on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star game participants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was voted the most valuable player of the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature under a ten @-@ year contract signed a total of 27 million US dollars annually . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrast to the end of December 31 , 2017 , he acts as a consultant and youth coach in the future . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed a few mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , there are only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is still not included in the glory hall of the base . &quot;
for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial his occurr@@ ence outside of the square .
&quot; as early as 2009 , Super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; was forbidden to have taken hold of ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was imprisoned in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal to 211 games by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ ect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a rule , the sperm was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; Rodri@@ guez said back then . &quot;
&quot; even his farewell @-@ days are not spar@@ ked , too . &quot;
while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games once again got the great stage Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not contain a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the actress Cameron Di@@ az and actress Kate Hudson and actress Kate Hudson , sympath@@ y conversion of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red SO@@ x . &quot;

Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ sky are first D@@ oping cases .
&quot; caught : because of a positive d@@ oping sample , wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter may not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overs@@ ha@@ do@@ wed by the first official atten@@ dees .
one experienced athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
the first official d@@ oping cases have become known in Rio de Janeiro before the seventh competition .
&quot; the Chinese swimming pool in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obst@@ acle in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ sky have been tested positive and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages come to the Un@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven during the last Sunday , which is used as a m@@ asked remedy for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , just about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en had to take part in the incident over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has submitted an opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the CA@@ S international sport Court , and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer is the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the restoration of the sport@@ s@@ men with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , with the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the lightweight . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to deal with the banned substance of the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was provision@@ ally suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should also be a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow returned immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t go the right sle@@ epers , &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus about all wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chronic d@@ op@@ sy poll@@ uted nation can not participate in Rio .
&quot; in Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ sky , &quot; also known as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , was tested positive for three days before his brother Tom@@ as@@ z , was tested positive on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both deny in@@ gest@@ ion , however , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the complete Russian team to start an exception because systematic D@@ op@@ ings to start the start , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming pool , in addition , the previous members in China had also disp@@ ers@@ ed for heavy disp@@ utes between the athletes . &quot;
this is the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang wait .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to pass over 200 m Fre@@ estyle , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot;
sun was also the center of a debate with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping che@@ aters , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested at the chin@@ ese tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ press h@@ ack@@ ers her delete money
programm@@ ers of experience malware and are currently targeted to specific companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by malware @-@ def@@ ender specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes from 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once , some multiple victims of a attack with ext@@ ortion software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware exhau@@ st@@ ion . &quot;
40 percent of victims paid by the perpet@@ rators brought out to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their ext@@ ortion software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in company network networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially slip ran@@ s@@ om are considerably higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a sc@@ ary quick evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ nings are still designed to send advertising . &quot;
&quot; then , the perpet@@ rators discovered the software for themselves . &quot;
&quot; only private nut@@ zer were the target , but the transition to company att@@ acking took place over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , they are looking for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as according to archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the press@@ er . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ kens Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; however , where in private use the personal photo database on the game is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage drops out if a Ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had to under@@ go the business activity completely , in case of a case humans were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pay off , you only encour@@ ages the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure the user researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the researchers and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to increase more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices via chat as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are redeemed by a few hundred Euros , companies have to take part hard @-@ negoti@@ ate and get five digits of sum@@ s in order to withdraw their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware recognition , h@@ ack@@ ers will always be professional and share the work , explains safety experts from the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write an Ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , it is possible for three or four persons . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their pollut@@ ant software into the form of a software design to the actual detection .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by malware , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes a adap@@ table , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the press@@ ors then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly collected software under the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so you log@@ ically log@@ ically in one of the forums on the underground , the set of a criminal and commissioned another with the software to install the software on many PCs . &quot;
payment is made per in@@ fic@@ ated calcul@@ ator .
&quot; normally , the crimin@@ als carry a spread with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can defend by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators already pursue new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the potential for damages according to type of data is still a multiple higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could be able to re@@ plen@@ ish new goals in the Internet of things on the grain . &quot;
&quot; on the h@@ acker conference def@@ con demonstrated security researcher , such as they could have been associated with the internet associated thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the fre@@ igh@@ ting of a der@@ art block heating could be so man@@ oeu@@ vre and be worth a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then rather have to block an entire production line in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
&quot; one for all cases , &quot;
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday use
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , who was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row as well as in the f@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and work pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top falls there somewhat . &quot;
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V storage space .
&quot; it is not only a suitcase set of 4@@ 53 l and 10@@ 26 l , with folded back arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be fl@@ ashing up like chin @-@ chair and provide storage space , which is high by the floor up to 1,@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is somewhat higher than comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel tested with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V due to torque value up to 300 Nm in wide speed areas .
&quot; however , he is likely to make his work slightly qui@@ eter . &quot;
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine concept : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering system is likely to be a little direct .
the equipment lets in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; doesn &apos;t have to be desired .
&quot; to safety systems , the City Not@@ brake assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ ision warning system and the trace assist@@ ent . &quot;
the coll@@ ision war@@ nings sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evaluated many obstacles in the ranking of interest as &quot; her@@ ring objects . &quot;
the remote control unit is very reliable .
&quot; and the intelligent temp@@ o regul@@ ators react to the traffic sign detection , and the intelligent tem@@ per on demand speed . &quot;
&quot; the full connectivity are only available for top quality : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; who doesn &apos;t want to invest so much , receives the petrol engine from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday mobile car .
Air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall to passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger seat on the passenger bridge .
&quot; only a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers which are typical for air traffic , argu@@ ed the Higher Regional Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down a knees with the fall .
&quot; the accident could however , however , could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had no compensation to the man .
disease case : when paid to the promot@@ er
&quot; after their trip , tourists get money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ less in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of the guests are reported to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ able case a family was severely affected by the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ ity , diarr@@ hea and vomiting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease brought back the holi@@ day@@ makers on a defective tri@@ but@@ ary that supposedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey had been fla@@ wed , and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
&quot; indeed , the wast@@ e@@ water situation was indeed defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er knew only shortly before leaving the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
&quot; until then , he had to go out that the sea@@ water was ok . &quot;
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment is . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - bl@@ ur@@ red by infection - belonged to the general life risk .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were affected . &quot;
&quot; said de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violent crimes committed in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people would worry about further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be paraly@@ sed and decided to react to terror at the same time .
safe is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t allow the terrorists of this triumph .
&quot; when perpet@@ rators would have to leave the country fast , increase the safety and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alized rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium @-@ sized magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
Symp@@ ath@@ ic advertising for terrorism has to be under penalty again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the weapon of weapons will be specified , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the last much discussed tail @-@ light for doctors should remain , according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères , words . &quot;
&quot; however , he wants to search for solutions in dialogue with the doctors of the doctors , such as the endanger@@ ing of citizens could be reduced , he said with a look at the psych@@ ic point of view . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister maintains a better social care . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared to be prepared with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
&quot; for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to investig@@ ating the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to the security further . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly stated action against action .
&quot; this was an ear @-@ plan for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the papers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ ator ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban , and the abol@@ ition of the double citizenship previously rejected . &quot;
a general prohibition of exec@@ utions is to be un@@ problem@@ atic for constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
you can &apos;t forbid everything you reject and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka .
they could speak about rules about in traffic or for witnesses .
green @-@ boss Simone Peter threw the Minister before he wants to sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and act of action .
&quot; Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger , left @-@ wing part@@ itions Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ ver@@ bs and a deep@@ ening of the common right bring men in this country no more safety . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
there are a regular look at the walk @-@ up road - here an image from November .
but this is meant to change : the re@@ sp@@ read@@ mill is to be extended .
this is good news for all car drivers who are travelling on the ambient street every night at St@@ au when they drive on the motorway A@@ pr@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the state of road construction extends on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 . / 17 . August ) in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ er Straße the legal track of 700 meters .
drivers can then go directly from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the total @-@ section on the versatile section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 will be improved . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the prolonged exit had the CDU faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the driving co@@ res at the Zu@@ br@@ inger is annoying to drive especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ g route and sometimes in addition .
reason is the con@@ i@@ adel@@ ie on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only one lane to the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static comp@@ ut@@ ations had shown that the bridge doesn &apos;t have the required load capacity , especially the heavy duty of heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and thus connecting con@@ gest@@ ion , the competent law can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to reck@@ oned : because the bridge has an official remaining duration of 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state @-@ operation has been looking for the traffic weaker time during school holidays , because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday lane at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule attended the theater &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s and the boy theatre are planning a music project now .
&quot; the association Nim@@ a &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; class International &quot; of the Forest School Children &apos;s house has attended a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the boy Theater Münster .
&quot; in the context of Nim@@ a &apos;s initi@@ ate , &quot; Inter@@ cultural voyage &quot; was initiated by 19 students between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the club , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit schools with welcome classes in the context of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the students of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible to follow the course of action so the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the boy Theater will work in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without flight and migration background are supposed to get the opportunity to attend professional training courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
&quot; offers for children and families in the area of theater play and theatre language placement , in the planning stage . &quot;
the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; project continues .
&quot; in view of the rising refugee figures , the association with many classes also want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope to improve weather conditions
the weather has made the shooting stars in the south @-@ west of Germany in the night of Germany to Friday a grain through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain so that the sky inspec@@ tions said , the chair@@ woman of the Ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the shooting , there are Per@@ sians who belong to the fastest star@@ ches with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which is in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , they roll for ever around , at night , hours is awake for hours , in the morning there is no longer thinking about getting enough sleep . &quot;
this is all others as relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces and more than ten per cent do their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there may be various causes of cause , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ak , member of the Board of the German Society for Sle@@ ep Invest@@ igation and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; however , what is understood by it , however , the In@@ som@@ nie , so an input and a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; right now , many people feel as an uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , member of the member of the German household association with practice in the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind Sle@@ ep Dys@@ function ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ oral factors can be found behind , but also medications . &quot;
no rare is the distur@@ bing expression of a different disease .
&quot; very early awakening is especially common with depression , &quot; says We@@ ak . &quot;
and it can be that different factors mean one another .
&quot; for example , who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc can lie badly , w@@ akes all two to three hours and starts to p@@ onder@@ ing over all day problems and care , We@@ ak gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is not possible anymore . &quot;
when should I sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a month of at least three nights a week , and is not affected by day , should go to a doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , un@@ finished , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical problems such as mag@@ enta or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to relie@@ ve the distur@@ b@@ ulation , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or also medications - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional case and maximum for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; founded in Germany in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ppers , head of the inter@@ disciplinary sleep medical center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you should first contact sleeping problems at first @-@ level with sleep problems . &quot;
&quot; with investigations , this may clari@@ fy whether the problems have a physical cause . &quot;
&quot; who should go in a sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for the investigation in sleep laboratory medicine , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , for illness of illness or if you do not find the cause of a sleep@@ y distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ bers . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make lunch , &quot; says Fi@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; after sli@@ pping , one goes into the bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as at your fingers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can people get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many pitches on which one can put for better sleep .
&quot; we@@ avers count on : regular sleep and asc@@ ending , not too long in bed , not sleep too long in bed , do not watch television to sleep , stopping drinking and at night not at the watch - then it begins immediately to calculate , and that is quite and not eligible . &quot;
what the Jung@@ le camp with missing medals in swim
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has already expressed himself on Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time in Doha and introduced its first world record at the same time . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V athl@@ ete Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook has sho@@ cked up his ex @-@ team @-@ mates via Facebook .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic champion of 20,000 € gets awarded and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig won € 150,000 , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control , however , very good . &quot;
so we can not compete with countries who promote very much and do not even want to see or operate on d@@ oping .

&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , the D@@ ei@@ bler would have already reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .

airport : Bande was arrested by Bag@@ di@@ eben
professional Die@@ be at Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 . &quot;
the susp@@ ect had committed a gang of hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and carrier steels .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 pm civilian officials from the airport Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several del@@ ici@@ encies since mid @-@ July of this year , and were very professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can have the th@@ ie@@ ves which had entered into Germany &apos;s desire , four actions . &quot;
&quot; they carried a total of more than 15,000 euros in total . &quot;
&quot; built in Alt@@ buildings , a few lenti@@ ls , in between still another head@@ stone steps : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in looks at first sight not so , but the police is among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk along the street from the east to the west , one comes to play , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , who should also be dismant@@ led soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the competent real estate firm Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , are preferred with burning cars in the last weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents were occupied , on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ en@@ ator has been particularly responsible for a tough pre @-@ approach police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after 22 June , the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , according to the police three weeks before the spot , locked parts of the street and kept visitors to enter the house with number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile restored construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the evacu@@ ation was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers moved from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain@@ ed in late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are available . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has been here three children , are mainly gener@@ alized by the police . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the home projects , they share the concern ahead of increasing ten@@ dencies and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a j@@ aw , who wanted to make a majority of police protection against v@@ agu@@ ing on the left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ en@@ en@@ ator and the police open between house occupied and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional &quot; district that is , even today , in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; house occupied and the native housing projects are already a long time to the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former DDR , including almost the whole Main@@ zer road close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared among large police officers , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are partly inhabited by the people today , which they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ ber@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them now , residents from GDR times and former house occupied their j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; this makes itself noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they are recognis@@ able in the designed slices or freshly kn@@ itted fac@@ ades which were subjected to colour bags .
no other road was mentioned so often with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours must be seen as a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : off@@ ences like body injury , according to statistics , according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the criminal off@@ ences make tan@@ gible , rather the newly built and newly renovated homes meet . &quot;
&quot; there is no speech for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 . &quot;
&quot; as for non@@ violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ ful : people in the 94 are their neighbours that do not have been determined . &quot;
also the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; for studying architect , her street is not a criminal record , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; here you can help each other , lives together on the road and gets more apart from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ s street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore it was so important that people get their street back : by the police , politics and media , which claimed all the interpretation of the world in July . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away from history : dis@@ soci@@ able new@@ buildings in former builders , which im@@ press the ancient inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are the con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction I cannot gu@@ er@@ ate absolute . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if any one never stops ? &quot;
&quot; there is also fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for Zu@@ ge@@ zo@@ gens , who stum@@ bled across colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who draws you should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub @-@ quarter , can complain badly about noise . &quot;
&quot; all who only presented with first names , have not asked to be called with their right name . &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partner in integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ical support is supported by the management of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees himself as a Response partner for all the actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer of the working group suggests that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now as thank@@ ful , that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving wool mil@@ king , which primarily has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked , rather than the multitude of desired tasks are targeted - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; been looking for an administrative building with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long experience in the area of social work , just a jeal@@ ous wool mil@@ king . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with people on site and also behind the scenes , as well as net@@ work@@ abilities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing so for around six weeks .
she has a 50 @-@ percent spot on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is honorary and full @-@ official players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been found for some time to find apartments for the connection @-@ policy which have been recognized .
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you must under@@ take the refugees in your own or rented residential areas .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility is moving from the coun@@ sell@@ or to the municipality and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer its home .
the search has been made for some time than very difficult .
de facto the administration gives no private apartments .
&quot; so far , I don &apos;t need to depend on private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , gener@@ alized apartments must be troubled , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it &apos;s not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lo@@ be , training places , training places , school courts , one @-@ euro job and training activities for refugees and migrants have to be arranged or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the Bau@@ hof or help house @-@ master , do @-@ profit @-@ profit work - and the motiv@@ ating and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community has to be a positive effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
but occupation does not mean work .
&quot; the day need a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would need to develop a conc@@ ei@@ vable experience .
&quot; so we need offers like sport , contacts with native loc@@ als and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here , administration and volunteer can jump . &quot;
&quot; it was central , that the refugees get the feeling they wish they were allowed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it takes to take over time , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; anyone who can sense the feeling that he could not work in Ur@@ bach cannot work , do not work and be un@@ profitable I will never integrate . &quot;
the distinct majority are motivated .
&quot; problem cases also exists , the customer says frank@@ ly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have been afraid of radic@@ alization in front of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer really clearly , &quot; what man@@ cher na@@ ive it may . &quot; a little risk could be able , but would not exclu@@ de it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are sensitive .
these inci@@ dents also are subject to refugees .
they would have fear that the attacks were put up completely in a call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and Vol@@ un@@ tary and Vol@@ un@@ te@@ er need to look out in the region according to activities . &quot;
&quot; they always have in the background , that soon a new impact on refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a limit ?
&quot; to answer this question , the policy is dis@@ cour@@ ageous . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is un@@ fair to place hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not arrived there , where we would like to say , &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le says . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher has already been fully utilized , so to integrate the existing human beings . &quot;
&quot; these are approximately 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , one needs to help them , both women may agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot;
