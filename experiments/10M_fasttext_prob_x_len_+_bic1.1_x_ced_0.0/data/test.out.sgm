<seg id="1">Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the two U.S. presidential candidates, however, are unquestionably in the tax and energy policy, as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the, about the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small, and warns against how the state of the economy can harm - with tax and regings."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to spread the economy to death and regulate to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it himself would be very different, claimed Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return reggae massively, and he makes himself strong for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says, the state has certain tasks to open, he has got to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the wealthy would be increased," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the needs to be invested, trump and Clinton say almost like the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected about the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump, you could still agree to the internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and the coal transport in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, Clinton wants to expand the renewable energy investment and calls for:" a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transport-fish trade agreement, don't want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both don't want to isolate the United States from international trade - just better to protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they are supposed to be paid even better, for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what if Trump doesn't want to do this question is not quite clear: once he says, the minimum wage has to be rushed, then he says, he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of both camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to reload the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him before, that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton says at least of the rich who wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">Sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone to almost everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatised."</seg>

<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles shortly and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the area of Condrobs, a carrier for social relief offers in Bavaria, and among other things, on the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fledged.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralised accommodations for alluring women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">Unlong it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - either as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a watchman in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated: every woman who comes here has made her escape from sexual violence, says Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars, because they are prosecuted because of torture or death, or because their families will send them as hopeas to Europe," she tells her. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there were other reasons for the escape:" many are going to steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, for example, for a bottle of water a sexual action call for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they come in Germany, recirre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single-single women would often be regarded as minor and worst in refugees."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women live in the north of Munich, traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women have been so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"often they often don't help to help, I need more accommodations for them, calls for Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they were walled by a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in accomodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabia alone, women are not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press release of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, lower and middle franken, there are several common floors or private homes only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "the Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or women are accommodated, men and women are accommodated, it can come to - forceability - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all the rooms should be easily accessible, and for women easily, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"as much to feel the women of this protection needs, one can read on Andalesen, which there is in Munich's house."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outer sides"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Tuesday, the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce their hands and an official end of the eight months of prolonged war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception I cannot claim that Ankara wants to destroy this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the torch, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile was narrouted and he has hardly felt warmth in itself for his restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke to his" dear friend, "Putin - according to a report about five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved so would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for me, his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable hails showed that the state of state of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his quotes: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutentbranded.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Putin divided and accused Ankara, fell into the back in the back."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this was even bigger, as it was celebrated by a veritable friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"building the triggering, it becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the government controlled media controlled a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once upon a time, the Turks would bear the Turks for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations of senior officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the territories of Syria, which will be controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it is time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse of the President of Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is on the first line all friends who can get when he failed to uncover a coup d'etat that had failed last month.</seg>
<seg id="28">Terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The amount is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights will be resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attraction to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the national television is forecast for fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" tourists take long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it was the response to the tried power of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persisting Groll come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pipike to draw attention from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state of state won a bonus for sure that he called for the attempted coup" état support for the chosen public organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a self-understandable that even a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting in this glorious palace at the sea allowed it to Russia and Turkey, as described as an analytical once described," "Alliance of Foreign lateral" ": two countries that overtook off from the West and are badly treated."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support both sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be noted that after almost three hours of first call on the press conference, they said that they did not have to strive the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey mised it to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize these."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member attacked Turkey, it is certainly better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he made his conclusion at the renowned State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of Kremlin, it is (in Russian) that he later became the leader of the head of the head of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thanks for your confidence."</seg>
<seg id="11">"I think it's the most important task of government to support law as head of state, and inspections for the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin divided the Russian TV station on Friday with that IVANOV has asked to leave his position and recommended Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei IVANOV was one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet intelligence service in KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that Chief of Staff came back on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridiculous of the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power fighting?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official statement - that a man, who once had been praised as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - pushed forward to big skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which will be quoted on the website of the Kremlin, IVANOV said," "It is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated item - you could almost say - to trust the post four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV recorded the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Military Intelligence (FSB), IVANOV was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"as Putin at power, he called IVANOV as one of five people whom he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once, IVANOV was assumed that IVANOV would have been President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have driven Putin against the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this item was taken by another, seamless ally Putins, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Putin was Prime Minister, before he became president of three and a half years later."</seg>

<seg id="4">"at Pokemon Go, people are going to get people from the sofa and get more active."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the screen at the beginning of the screen was initially limited to television, then limited to video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it's great to see that technology and activities do not exclude each other each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that was based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later a drawing show, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of popculture, interest in the game fell slightly before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand, which overloaded the servers."</seg>
<seg id="10">"within days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller undernourished his immune system and Würgereflex a serious test - making some of the most polluted and hardest places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk moved his position on a banister along the Piccadilly Circus, a rinse head of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"prior to the end of each object, he used a luminance to show and show us what he will let."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to lestick the flush of a drawback, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria and its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left behind what he tapped, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his Darms by travelling through the world, and ate strange things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"public railways to train stations up to rinse items of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely below a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told me:" as a child, I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just for his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His probeak showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in comparison, the Luminometry weight is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to withdraw after their Luminometry was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands were less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I have tarried in a toilet, close. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There's nothing more dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will do nothing here because it is intimeless here.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Geosus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to do something new to the consumer. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"something that is fascinating, and at the same time, the benefits of Probiotics explains."</seg>
<seg id="25">We brought crazy Brainstormings that we ended that we said "Leave us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put it into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and as it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in the intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film director, added:" let me say so, "I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had wished some of the things I have told him, just like the ekeldy Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian, to do it and others, where this was pretty difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we have recorded some of these dirty delicacies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a validation of validation conducted by the year 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="4">"in 2021, the country code will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>

<seg id="6">"the locals that are convinced by the elections are to be convinced, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most holidaymakers, which are in the country, are on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are no locals, so not to choose the Landtag."</seg>

<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern will have to talk about a campaign about the people on the day until 4 September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if one can say that at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and there's also something about: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry."</seg>

<seg id="28">"because much on the game stands, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the African Union (19)."</seg>

<seg id="3">"before you go to the commenser, to oversew him under the pseudonym non-binding men's accusation, this statement runs from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the most elaborate revival of records did not want to be seen on a boom in millennials that we want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but to the Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"those who have bought a record recently, are all preceded by age 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Kish group."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older record runners retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a message report on television, I would follow the camera while I wait in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest grey suit and wild gesture, before I stand before I keep my hands hold on it, and let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos slowly affects its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once an independent seller is based - is there a handful fantastic record specialist."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera of camera to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand up in close proximity to different men in such stores and try to estimate their age and mind by observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men mean age) in Reckless Records (data: eight men mean age, a woman, probably around the 20) sequence, is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops in order to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I wonder?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot via e-mail, I did not follow him home), put the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy it when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70's, that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, in which I was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who buy plates are rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds:" I don't smoke, and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my case.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works in Sister Ray, also believe that many customers who meets the Yougov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave to people who have influenced by the media, people who have heard about comeback to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"by the talks who I have led, people usually have offended their collection at the beginning of 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their records sold to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to the disc sewerage of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica to recognize that record businesses offers a soothing community of equilations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers participated in the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and would like to move back to the stability of trusted sound records, of objects, the happy jugencies."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is me as collectors and I think it's so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal falsely.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" "well, a staff of a plate stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, they haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also out that 41% have one record player, they never use it while 7% of those who buy a plate, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very much worried while I blasted through a stack of Bossa Nova compiler."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data: three men mean age) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently entered here and said," "I have no record player, but I'd like to buy a radio record, so I'd like to put it into shelf," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who just come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, dedicated to the record plates almost a whole floor, has an undermining audience than I cleanse."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make pictures, Teenagers and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts of the latest synthesizer- and sexist pop instead of experimental jazz drumps - is it good to see such diversity in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them is particularly lonely lonely, but brand psychotic traumas are hard to imagine if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around business for a couple of minutes and viewed the Varietance for sale of the plates."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannebumblebee than a big buy.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't make any much, therefore the collecting records are not a real option," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="51">It will cost much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer, or to other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drives with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I admit the note, I observe the jeans hotpants, I observe a group of young teen cameras that moves to a moment around Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter think to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left you can find a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a blend of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks like it - maybe because they are only in decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to handle it."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items will mean more money for the industry and some customers in the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, even the one who is the most suitable for luxury objects such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my re-researches showed that the results of Yougov vote, they are, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and Onlinefors."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety not with the bumblebees by turntables of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they suppress the rigid glance of an uncanny, 30-year-old mismoderator who rises above the shoulders nothing wrong, middle age."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is, as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is served by the wristbands for the triathletes, for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't listen to the television, read a paper or listen to your neighbor in the Warteshop, without saying about Simone Biles, Katie Leap, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there's Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women of women with dimples, could well be sent to Prime Time, if he had a swimmers, Turner or even Freal would be."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade, the sports, which are not generally acknowledged: air pistol shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and let it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I am modest, make arguments for my particular darling, then let me leave the attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years was so pointently perceived that many that had questioned I didn't know that it is a Olympic portart."</seg>
<seg id="14">That could be the regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA athletes sent to the competition, it never won a medal in trampoline jumping and succeeded in 2012 with a athletes who managed it to the final round."</seg>

<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline jumping has a certain outsider, partly because it sounds for the unlocked ear suitable for a clownsschule as the ideal for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a few enthusiasm."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremors of his never to end up - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and taurine, which combines two sports, which essentially unites."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long, one ally of the United States "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators call for political changes in Ethiopia, struggling to violent resistance of the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia straight together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the past ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid board of West Africa with a fast-growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the past few months, protests against the government and the territory expanded steadily."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people fell on streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">"witnesses gave witness that policemen shot on an armed fire, killed and killed."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about protests, probably from the last or early of this year, show how security forces were to beat young people with sticks, while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for Human Rights requires an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to collect this country and in future it will even become even more difficult," "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa, and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, particularly in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded its pace in the pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new Pendlertrain in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even though Ethiopia had everything else than a role for democracy - human rights organisations continued to continue the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were committed to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or to prison, or put them into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress People and don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are many complaints, which cover everything from the soil use until digging in relation to power the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the opposition, and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions rise along the border to Eritrea, a battle for this zacky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts predict that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, were able to benefit from turbulence and armed forces in recent years."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of the provocation after years are now exploding under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media as cheap smartphones were increasingly more common and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, do many people still communicate on the Internet proxies, which hide themselves wherever they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they were gathered so to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they prospered the Amharas who come from offices mainly Christian high countries, in politics and economy, while they are exploited Oromos, of which many Muslims live and live in flat areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are able to co-ordinate among a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population, and in the military, in the intelligence services, commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in a non-public disease in 2012, 17 years of Ethiopia Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was viewed as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly obtrusive in it, to perceive early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special contractors to edit enemy, and to make them harmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this basic skill," Mr Abdi said, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unsecured reasons to increase the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike the Lord Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopian, Mr Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys not the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had experienced an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections protested, according to the claims of analytics of the government and then stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razicia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and this time of turbulences went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praising Ethiopian leaders for their visionaries infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlerite, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty line."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the Intensification of the internal Missing of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month's protest in Gondar, a amharian city, of Tigray guided businesses and the hatred for the Tigray will always be held in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests and other Western allies bring to such a position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenlos over the neighboring Somalia, even if she hasted that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West will definitely want to support democracy, he doesn't want to merge his ally in a volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi," "is a very thin background."</seg>

<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he drew strong criticism of himself when he thought that Russians should chop up Mrs. Clinics's Emails, but later he said" "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the linguistic boundaries in politics and then go back to rowing.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a abundant meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his rise to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as foodies, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacy of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de Foie gras and Maryland."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was something modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato purée and as a dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," There was also a message to the Americans as they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both Food historian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" was inspired by the Chinese cuisine in the US while brick in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building at the Lower East Side from the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"their newest cooperation," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrated the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's sandwich shop for dinner, a small, scourge Imbiss in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh affectionate with olive trees while Coe, 57, Truthahn with potato purée and vegetable."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter minced ground, this couple found a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich food were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanut bread, liver cheeses and bean bread. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">"imagine, so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as a dinner."</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been placed in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression was the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cook for male rives and it was served freshly baked Pastete for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans that were sent to starving Europeans during the first World War." "A Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country went with it to be no longer the saffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time, in the food for the Americans became a central, shared theme," begged Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new Budgetdibility: mysterious dishes such as breads and kassertion were found too staple food, the Kasserolle as" wonderful kind, food waste "" noticed Ziegelman, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the heart of the American kitchen for years, was too rare."</seg>
<seg id="26">"such mixtures were tried, as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction of the precedence over taste or even healthy food was understood."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also comprises recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to the midday," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household items.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as ever before or since then, business economics - among them Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by creating recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encourage women to become" "budgetolitiful" "and the challenge, Pampe like creamy Spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals to transform."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal," is a feast of historical treats. "</seg>
<seg id="35">Especially tasty are the reports of the government's answer to the hungry citizens such as President Herbert Hoovers Lass-me cake-food posture.</seg>
<seg id="36">"while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse in his kitchen, he speists like the millionth man of the world to which he became."</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cucumber," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was a great surprise.</seg>
<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt could perhaps have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor would have asked him to equip a postmark with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, the owner of a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roosevelt said that the White House brought the boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial meal prepared."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of Great Depression, going to deal with food was rejected, once the country came back on the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food," says Ziegelman, as well as science on food. "</seg>
<seg id="44">"the couple announced in writing the book the eating habits of Ziegelmans in law to have better understood - for example, how they could not throw it away."</seg>
<seg id="45">"she had a real fear of food waste," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="46">Ziegelman recalled: "people actually made people sick."</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the wind-breaking case.</seg>
<seg id="48">"after the plates were vacated at Eisenberg's dishes, they stripped and cook a dessert they cooked at home: the plaught, the President Roosevelt ate in lunch."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it will be called Prune Whip," "said Ziegelman and added that it was a usual trick to miss a nice name."</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no proposed cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>
<seg id="51">"everyone dipped somewhat against a spoon into the fence, brown glibber."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland will usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>

<seg id="8">"when it comes to it, the five meter long animal accelerates at a range of 2.6 km / h - and this top speed is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">But this loneliness of loneliness seems to be a godept for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal" Science "from a Greenland, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commenting on the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist presumed too long, that Greenland will become stone."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was lacking.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland's sharks are hard to watch, and they live mainly in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her timberpentempo limbs them, when they played six animals in front of Svalbard, with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks still make this sharks: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another one had swallowed up the jaw bone of a young polar bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the iron ore and looking for cadaver that torches from higher water layers after bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the biggest 502-cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, it is analyzed with the carbon-14 method of the shark core of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of sharks, that would not be renewed in the proteins."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of Carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore be in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as atomic attempts to undergo larger quantities of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"with 220 centimetres in length of the smallest animal, the Linsencore contained a minor excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger herds of Greenland had a normal carbon-14 quantities that arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeters long Greenland was a age of 335 years, while the record-shark might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Grönlandhai females then get offspring when they are over four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to arrange an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"due to one of the animals with 392 centimeters long at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland's sharks with the increase of at least one and a half times a time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"such methusal ema, especially in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, stuck in his bacon in the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon top, was captured in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures frequently, animals of the living animals are often living on sparring."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so they mature, later - and slower slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface due to which the animal eats heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of 1 gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on focusing on as early as many descendants as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, a very big animal should have invested its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of experience malware and are currently targeted to specific companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by malware-defender specialists Malwarebytes from 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of surveyed companies have been at least once, some multiple victims of a attack with extortion software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies have already achieved a target of a Ransomware exhaustion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators brought out to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their extortion software according to the observations of Malwarebytes on attacks in company network networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potentially slip ransom are considerably higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a scary quick evolution of the damage software," explains Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the Malwarnings are still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">"then, the perpetrators discovered the software for themselves."</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private nutzer were the target, but the transition to company attacking took place over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, they are looking for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as according to archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"afterwards, the software presents the demands of the presser."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryptokens Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where in private use the personal photo database on the game is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage drops out if a Ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German companies reported revenue losses due to Ransomware, 13 per cent had to undergo the business activity completely, in case of a case humans were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of nurse."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pay off, you only encourages the problem," says Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, F-Secure the user researchers investigated the user interfaces and contact with the researchers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to set up a kind of customer service to increase more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices via chat as they can pay by Bitcoin, set freely accessible support websites or decrypt free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed by a few hundred Euros, companies have to take part hard-negotiate and get five digits of sums in order to withdraw their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware recognition, hackers will always be professional and share the work, explains safety experts from the Antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write an Ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, it is possible for three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutant software into the form of a software design to the actual detection.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by malware, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price range between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery includes a adaptable, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The pressors then look for further hackers to spread the freshly collected software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you logically logically in one of the forums on the underground, the set of a criminal and commissioned another with the software to install the software on many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per inficated calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"normally, the criminals carry a spread with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can defend by file-back-ups and scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators already pursue new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful recovery, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the potential for damages according to type of data is still a multiple higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could be able to replenish new goals in the Internet of things on the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">"on the hacker conference defcon demonstrated security researcher, such as they could have been associated with the internet associated thermostat under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of the winter, the freighting of a derart block heating could be so manoeuvre and be worth a ransom."</seg>

<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Innensenator has been particularly responsible for a tough pre-approach police against the project, the area called" No-Go-Zone "for police officers and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after 22 June, the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, according to the police three weeks before the spot, locked parts of the street and kept visitors to enter the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile restored construction workers on behalf of unknown house owners the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the evacuation was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers moved from sympathizers and residents."</seg>

<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, a primary school and kindergartens are available."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has been here three children, are mainly generalized by the police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the home projects, they share the concern ahead of increasing tendencies and centrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">"it doesn't sound like a jaw, who wanted to make a majority of police protection against vaguing on the left."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the ditch, which the Berlin Innenenator and the police open between house occupied and their neighbours, does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional" district that is, even today, in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk. "</seg>

<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared among large police officers, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are partly inhabited by the people today, which they had occupied 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and elecberliners from all over the world: with them now, residents from GDR times and former house occupied their jaw."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this makes itself noticeable in the rents, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they are recognisable in the designed slices or freshly knitted facades which were subjected to colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned so often with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for that not all neighbours must be seen as a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: offences like body injury, according to statistics, according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the largest part of the criminal offences make tangible, rather the newly built and newly renovated homes meet."</seg>
<seg id="26">"there is no speech for Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for nonviolence, it is weightful: people in the 94 are their neighbours that do not have been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">Also the famous burning cars give it straight to the Rigaer longer in the Rigaer longer.</seg>
