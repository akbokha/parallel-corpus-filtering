Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friendship .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and moving into the Ne@@ ar East in the Middle East .
&quot; in the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution should also go . &quot;
&quot; for years , the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious . &quot;
&quot; Washington critic@@ ises the constant sett@@ ling of Israel , and calls on the peace process to engage in the peace process . &quot;
&quot; through the deal offered by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu announced the invitation of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress a controversial speech that was used partly as an aff@@ r@@ ont to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken about Obama , a meeting was then denied the election in Israel with regard to the election . &quot;
professor in a emergency call to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon spoke with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ led voice of the police , that he would have shot his friend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts &quot; the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; in the house the officials found the dead du@@ che of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ lass and a handwritten note , I wanted to do it , I loved it , I loved it and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot; &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter , and he was signed . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication of that Lamb , who travelled throughout two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , signed up 300 miles to the school grounds , and according to the police , he was already shot and killed by the police to his office . &quot;
Delta @-@ University Poli@@ st@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford states that university staff members have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 hrs .
&quot; he said , that he has made the fat@@ eful emergency call at some point later . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb had taken the life when the police spar@@ ked him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting in the University , the students and teachers try to hide himself behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of it , what has been motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details that were published on the two ends of the state have published details , as well what students and employees who knew him , helped create a picture of a talented , but probably difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were rejo@@ iced at his lessons .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ e@@ al died , said he did not have a story of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; he has been mentioned in a written book , in whom he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both persons employed in the department of social sciences and history , whose teachers are 17 members , and many students visited the courses . &quot;
at the same time there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ ie , who Lamb married , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he had told him that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; previously , the delta state University had asked for a assessment of health reasons and said that he has any problem of any health problem . &quot;
this year he set up only two online courses .
&quot; in addition to the latest changes in employment policy of the university , the doctoral thesis , for the Lamb who had worked so hard for him , would provide no guarantee for an automatic approach to finding as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s conception . &quot;
these are questions that should not answer any more .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur down the Mississippi of Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he was arrested , before he could be arrested , he claimed self with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner met@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran in the way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she thinks he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
demonstrated grew in the area .
&quot; from 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has more than 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , raising ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he rehear@@ sed in Spring in ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long years of friends , he called him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
&quot; they and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool old guy , who tried some years to teach her guitar . &quot;
&quot; he was a s@@ warm of women , then . &quot;
&quot; all the girls sh@@ av@@ ed when he was there , &quot; said hair@@ y , lives 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and pr@@ un@@ ing were together a lot of time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no charter of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who once lived with them in the brick house and ad@@ join Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was ok .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were left before 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said that he never met with his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , but he was listening to music who was interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
Lamb concluded Pr@@ ent@@ iss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came out both on a summer @-@ year @-@ old three years ago .
later they played together one or more gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en told his daughter , she sings her own music . &quot;
dent@@ ition was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender , and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ ju@@ p Room at The Ju@@ ju@@ p Room , said that he Lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night stopped at night on the night of September 5 , after that he concluded his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ ingly audience . &quot;
there were no signs saying anything was not right .
&quot; he simply said a happy pair , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the dying and shou@@ ting together .
I mean they both had a good sense for kid@@ ding .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead Professor , conducted the Spanish semester seminar program and specialized on American indigenous and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , a English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; he studied at the Emp@@ oria state University in Kansas , as well as President of his Brotherhood and the Student Committee . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta @-@ campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the church on a candle commemorative ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ mid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt was also involved in the night guard , while she sang &quot; &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot; &quot;
the lessons are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported between Cleveland and Mississippi .
&quot; Associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans carried too this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect a susp@@ ect that the police now says that , Lamb has shot the emergency call , after he had shot this , and that lamb had said in his emergency call Pr@@ ent@@ olz , but there was no indication of the fact that the two had ever been married . &quot;
Toys R Us is planning to set less workforce for Christmas time
&quot; Toys R Us says that it will not be so much Christmas season staff like last year , but the toy and baby products distributor says that he will spend an opportunity to work with his employees and seasonal workers to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it will plan to susp@@ end 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 45@@ ,000 workers were hired . &quot;

the company said that there will be a job interview in this month and the head@@ count increased from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still 3 months away , the Christmas business moves closer , and companies prepare to prepare time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees that sell , disp@@ atch , sell products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox comes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
&quot; for personal reasons , it was remarkable . &quot;
&quot; we sat at the theater are waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is standing beside me and it becomes very clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for the upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me that I am a sim@@ ulated g@@ aps and a arm length of it , with the prin@@ cess of Wales , at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary on &quot; Back to the Future &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
back for the Future &quot; 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed one of the greatest time travel film that has ever been filmed . &quot;
back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D DVD and in selected cinemas in October .
&quot; UN boss states , there is no military solution in Syria . &quot;
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon says Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon , who puts his answer to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; for almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen over violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss , on all other parties , calls on all parties including the shared UN security council to join re@@ unite and integr@@ ative talks on fin@@ ds of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban announced a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five member states of the Council of the United States , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - at the edge of the General Assembly &apos;s Council to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the connections in the Council and the Regional Policy will make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; ban has resulted in the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , which they proved to have been demonstr@@ ating on nuclear de@@ als with Iran . &quot;
8 responses to show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to make him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the main route to the down@@ stream , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys exhibit Donald Tr@@ ump in double digits , and some start to wonder what it meant for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate business . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
neither claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
experts have emphas@@ ize that during this time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys made the lead to the rising production of Herman Peri@@ ods in which none of whom gained a state in the face process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but global front@@ bands like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth have seen Tr@@ um@@ ps run@@ down and start to run their dollars just around .
here are some current environmental values that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul cannot just have a temporary stage :
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s popularity characteristics are turned by 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a Mon@@ mouth @-@ University pol@@ l showed that only two of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
in early August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures keep themselves in the early states .
&quot; at the last week , a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac set out Io@@ wa , 60 per cent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P are happy with p@@ umping as candidate .
&quot; in a CNN pol@@ l of CNN &apos;s last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; excited , &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump should be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; sc@@ and@@ alized , &quot; when he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages to say about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in hell ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied or , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favor@@ ites of the establishment , would say . &quot;
a majority of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans can &apos;t see tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; during Donald Tr@@ ump Assessment for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of those of those rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been critic@@ ising that the real estate Mog@@ ul says the real temper@@ ament to a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pr@@ un@@ ing state of the nation , the State of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent do not think that he did not spend the personality in order to effectively implementing his office and to control almost six of 10 un@@ related means that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House , as ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters used to get used to the idea .
&quot; when they keep their hon@@ esty , Republi@@ can elec@@ tive voters keep on real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P &quot; nomin@@ ation , &quot; following a CNN pol@@ l in CNN , say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
it is a change since the time when four out of ten ended her money to Je@@ w@@ Bush in July .
complete dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters in the past did not have the clear crystal ball .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Rep@@ ublic@@ ans remembered that Rick Per@@ ry won the nomin@@ ation of just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
yet it shows that a wide range of GO@@ P @-@ voters will take a campaign to take action as a pl@@ au@@ si@@ bel .
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered themselves another one , he sum@@ b@@ ump almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps lead , while the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support to more than a dozen of other Can@@ didates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head at head between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump , and majority support . &quot;
&quot; before Marco Ru@@ bio , he has 14 points ahead , before Walker Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the business owner with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head at his head .
a large majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says that they have made their mind .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support the b@@ ump , say that they have granted their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot will happen to change that , and no one can really say not to change my opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said they open the door , in order to change other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ torate so they have formed their mind , twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they are , with Tr@@ ump , at the subject of Immig@@ ration . &quot;
&quot; ever since Donald Tr@@ ump in his electoral campaign had been &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; between two months &apos; immigrants , the Immig@@ ration Court at the Public Deb@@ ate was held in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expressions of Tr@@ ump @-@ trained Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep far from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post @-@ pol@@ l of Monday , six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they are entitled to equal questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration in the lim@@ el@@ ight remains , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently sorry to do it . &quot;
the fru@@ stration about the government clim@@ bs up to new high@@ stands .
&quot; meanwhile around half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , nearly half of the support of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors , is primarily evident . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they would prefer to have a political out@@ si@@ der than somebody with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated at 54 percent &quot; in@@ dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent in@@ treated . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
there is the world &apos;s most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea desert .
the street costs a square @-@ square meter space of an average of 7@@ 3.@@ 300 Euros .
&quot; according to Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects in natural condition is limited , so it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which specific areas are a square meter . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ ds in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top locations , however , the price as Pe@@ an@@ uts draws to one of the prices as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate provider Angel &amp; Mon@@ ers has released an rank@@ ings of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square met@@ e@@ prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro of ni@@ x - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
but good to who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not here on top .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream reconstruction with Müller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller made a barrel .
&quot; a happy hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ ra@@ ded the road to a well @-@ deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympic ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus , then it was running . &quot;
a convincing start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario G@@ ze , the rock@@ ing chair in Pi@@ raeus staged a dream start to the Milan Mission of Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off game in the Champions League at the Greek Record Champion St@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Divine Plan ( 8@@ 9th ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth place in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; the winner of the Champions League , a leading boun@@ ce by Olympic ak@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who didn &apos;t pass a shot fired shots of the world champion at the Champions League in the Champions League . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate that , Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ame had promised , in front of the game at the Stadium in Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium in 31.@@ 6@@ 88 - and the Munich established word . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated and eng@@ aging imagination , with no shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus staged its youngest six home games in the Royal class , including the former clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) arrived here . &quot;
&quot; the Bavaria , defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not wish to be next victims . &quot;
&quot; they went trem@@ end@@ ously , but with their open efforts , however , they often seem to be inv@@ inci@@ ble . &quot;
the attacks were led to often by game siege on the left side Douglas Costa who was rare with the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck when his flan@@ k struck from the right hem@@ line in the left upper To@@ re@@ ck .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski had the best occasions in half .
&quot; first of all , when the Olympic @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the head ball from the Pol@@ es on the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct delivery , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with the knee should par@@ ked ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria had used their domin@@ ance game , Pi@@ raeus was able to place Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
then he was directed at Tor@@ ke@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er .
like that he drew a shot of Ide@@ ye on the lat@@ in ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; prior to New , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola had a quad@@ ru@@ ple with David Al@@ as in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario G@@ ze , after muscular problems , back in the Ka@@ der , sat out at first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup I gave a green light after the final training , he said , &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it , that &apos;s really bad . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he built King@@ sley Com@@ an for a stra@@ ined Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made a step further . &quot;
it happened in the stadium to Kra@@ wa@@ a in front of the game .
&quot; after a small group of mostly avoided Bavaria fans obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went to fight against the Munich p@@ endants . &quot;
at least a Bavarian fan was carried out viol@@ ated from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing his teeth &quot;
&quot; if you smoke , it does not only harm the lung , but also the teeth - that &apos;s a long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; the good news : when sh@@ out , the risk drops rapidly . &quot;
smoking permitted a significantly elevated risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is out of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several fellow staff at the German Institute for Nut@@ riti@@ onal Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smoking people , smokers would like to lose their teeth pre@@ mat@@ ure@@ ly in order to lose the 2,@@ 5@@ 2.5 to 3.6 @-@ times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes for dental op@@ oration be dental c@@ aries and infections of gum , emphas@@ izes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of gum are caused by frequent fl@@ esh@@ ly fl@@ ashes with smokers .
&quot; do not be clari@@ fied , however , smoking also increases the risk of cav@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; researchers at the &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; could reduce their risk during a short period of time , but they could reduce their risk during a short period of time . &quot;
&quot; however , it could not be over ten years before the endanger@@ ing to reign again to the level of non @-@ smokers , the first author Thomas Dietrich was inspired by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; it needs to be persu@@ asive people to be persu@@ asive , non @-@ smoking , director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking sticks the lif@@ esp@@ an . &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and leads to our knowledge also too good dental health up to the high age .
&quot; in Germany over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by denti@@ sts , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
&quot; earlier studies , however , would have been noted that smoking will increase the risk of early tooth loss . &quot;
the new long @-@ term study substanti@@ ate the findings .
archae@@ ologists meeting at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer at the late anti@@ quity
&quot; once again , archaeological sites have been made in Cologne at the right side of Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; archae@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German @-@ German Empire have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons during the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ le@@ vard , and the museum director Marcus Trier , on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are on the search for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the Cologne area , the Museum is constantly growing as an Department for Archae@@ ological and Urban History . &quot;
in the third construction section of the Rhine @-@ lev@@ ards the ar@@ che@@ ologists were now considered .
&quot; from text documents , this was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , we explained in Trier . &quot;
&quot; beside the ruins of the fortress and the church , there was also a cemetery with approximately 350 graves , was probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TT@@ IP
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system , which has been implemented over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement . &quot;
the controversial private dis@@ lighting equipment for disp@@ utes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system that is clearly reflected in its functionality .

delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan becomes Stev@@ ens on stage in Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to him , a fli@@ pchart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated folk music recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost caught on Stev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he rel@@ ates on the basis of several locations , which he au@@ stri@@ ve on the map ever again describing his celebr@@ ity and tender songs . &quot;
where they were created and what it looks like there is in his homeland .
&quot; since that , Stev@@ ens proves to be amazing . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; un@@ expect@@ edly composed songs that sounds quite close to American folk music of the late six@@ ties , but at any time to the great opul@@ ent peaks . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a built @-@ in series : each of the 50 states that should be cons@@ ul@@ ted in a row . &quot;
but already in 2004 and near the Rhine there is already a &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; and breaks very positive expectations .
reduced to Stev@@ ens here .
live watch him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician will return to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Natur@@ oise &quot; ) , a comprehensive architectural masterpiece published in 2005 . &quot;
transfer@@ ring to ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in no one rank@@ ings of the influential music media .
&quot; following its very productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then served as &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic counter@@ parts . &quot;
&quot; this sixth performer studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmable sequences or beats and play with all sorts of effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; for the smaller clubs , the stage ho@@ ws show the colorful spectac@@ le on Neon @-@ Stir@@ ne bands and a large fluorescent stage . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens are working as a member of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
Hamburg @-@ based Hamburg More !
&quot; he primarily presented the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well , &quot; which has been available since March . &quot;
&quot; although close to 2,000 guests were captured in their chairs , the big att@@ ack@@ er@@ ous Stev@@ ens will return back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians play a wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
&quot; from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent , &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; plate . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens encour@@ ages very much older songs and finally ten@@ ds herself under thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
Jeremy Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary group
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns is eag@@ erly awaited by the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ bit@@ n will be his debut in the Prime Minister &apos;s parliamentary group , and was first put to use David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n will ex@@ hil@@ t the first of its six given questions shortly after noon , with its output by the media , probably to the Labour M@@ EPs . &quot;
he asked &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
&quot; he also said that he could ski@@ p some sessions , to leave her colleagues . &quot;
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary assessment of Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns leadership , as she comes to being a member of the ch@@ att@@ enk@@ in after his appointment during the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision was prov@@ oked during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ised by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the centre of several cover page stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s decision to not sing the national hy@@ mn , has caught attention &quot;
he was a speaker named Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n who had stood &quot; in respec@@ tful silence &quot; and was recognised the &quot; hero@@ ic of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in , Owen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ week program , he gave the Labour leader to sing the national hy@@ mn , &quot; independent &quot; by his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; a dozen of the shadow companies have refused to serve at Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns @-@ top team , and they were calling on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party was originally supported as leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t , the political dis@@ agreements also said within the Labour Party , namely , following Mr Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s statements for the position of the European Union and the limitation of prizes . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n , the TU@@ C Conference , said the changes in labour , in order to remove all the idea of a limitation . &quot;
&quot; later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions Minister said Mr Smith , the &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; party that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ in £ 23.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n will be the fifth person chair@@ woman , Prime Minister David Cameron since he is T@@ ory @-@ boss , in the last decade , on the Disp@@ atch box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy principle , says that &quot; crow@@ d sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron has been given more then 30,000 remarks . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the fra@@ y of the Prime Minister is too con@@ front@@ ational , and that he should under@@ go both &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the dispute with resistance to be under@@ going , and focused on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ bit@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow specialist will be represented at him , is not particip@@ ates - for example if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into a conversation that other colleagues occasionally tried to seize the word and that he used John Ber@@ cow , the spokesperson for the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he would be associated with the policy in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ The@@ aters , &quot; who often have been associated with the question of Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was first sent to television in 1990 , the question was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer by the Prime Minister and his position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ol@@ ition , although viewers argu@@ ed argu@@ ed that she had become too a caric@@ ature and need further adequate reforms . &quot;

&quot; the pound has increased dramatically to data , which showed a rise in wage growth in the United Kingdom . parallel to this , F@@ T@@ SE 100 was increased by the BM@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.9 % over the same period of the same period last year . &quot;
this percentage had been the fastest and earned ass@@ ess@@ ments at the time of interest in interest .
&quot; the pound increased by more than 1 % from the dollar to $ 1,@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding common share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the takeover offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies and brands like Bud@@ ì@@ j@@ ito , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; according to the outstanding news from the competition group , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.9 % higher for luxury goods . &quot;
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures suggest every expectations , and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - growth again . &quot;
inc@@ en@@ core went up 5 % after the mining sector said that he took $ 2.5 billion by a stock sale as part of its strategy of debt reduction .
&quot; the equ@@ ities of the packaging and paper group MON@@ DI remained the largest tra@@ ilers on the index , with a decline of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sachs has made his assessment for the company &apos;s rating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports went up 3.1 % after the sports committee for the first half of the year reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.6 million .
&quot; the head of J@@ D Sports says , that higher wages are the expansion . &quot;
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean more purchasing power in the potential customers .
&quot; however , it is unlikely that this purchasing power will pay the higher working cost at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional work@@ stations . &quot;

Peg@@ i@@ da Screen Saver contains Lebanese Pot@@ ato @-@ Ide@@ a
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - in fact , in the potato @-@ ön@@ er , has developed the Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay in the Ol@@ den@@ berg owner of Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
inspired by the saying &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ ön@@ er on a poster by the Peg@@ i@@ da movement , Al@@ h@@ ay gave potato and meat together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; on the idea , a poster was brought to him with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen chance on TV by chance . &quot;
&quot; since then , a grill sk@@ e@@ wer sp@@ its in its shop , that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s Multi@@ c@@ ult@@ i for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
the idea has since changed the Lebanese man at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; there , according to the authority , the authority has been protected as a utility models . &quot;
&quot; how much meat and how many potatoes of the sk@@ e@@ wers also contains , Al@@ h@@ ay will not dis@@ betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; but it tastes better : &quot; it tastes better &quot; , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary knowledge will also be good at its customers .
met@@ ra starts ground @-@ trans@@ itional campaign to fight al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
he is trying to protect the IG@@ A stores before a Al@@ di walk in South Australia and Western Australia .
food @-@ whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ re has launched a campaign management campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retail@@ er in South Australia and Western Australia as a result of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , strengths and IG@@ A @-@ supermarkets will build their relationship with local food suppliers and marketing the IG@@ A by mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing via the soci@@ etal media , as well as events such as Adelaide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A tra@@ ders and suppliers get on board , with brands such as Eis@@ producer Provi@@ o from D@@ un@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A @-@ Shops , distributed and shop @-@ owners who sell forbidden tickets for the South Australian Football League for loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ re publishes more details of its defense strategy on September 29 if the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers for food , alcohol and devices will be out through its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s IG@@ A shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins than met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; in South Australia and Western Australia , the purch@@ aser of North Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to around 14 percent in Eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stanley in that twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two states will take away all of the actors and primarily independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley revealed that IG@@ A retail@@ er could lose 360 million euros in revenues per year and a cash of $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this predi@@ ction is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 subsidiaries in SA and 30 in WA , generating revenue of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and grocery and the quantities of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high @-@ cost base could cost $ 13 million in profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Meta has lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan found out that IG@@ A @-@ buyers are the faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stanley is aware that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in food and grocery store by 3.8 per cent in 2016 and 2.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2017 will reduce the market share of 14 percent by 2020 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told participating in a business in Melbourne that Metall@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ re declined to react in public to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; the market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and the income derived from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s foods and food trade , which is approximately 1,200 percent , has fallen by 43 percent , which is reflected by the operating debt reduction in turnover and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; however , the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers managed to invest more than 150 million $ in order to improve sales prices with Col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products per week to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and to provide a better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief business leader Ian Mor@@ rice says that price adjustment and shop re@@ development programs at an Elan , and hopes that the Grand @-@ whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit growth in 2017 at the first time in four years . &quot;
than@@ asi Kok@@ ch@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis partner Steve He@@ aly .
than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ i is rather deser@@ ved of praise as criticism for his behavior .
&quot; the Co@@ il Kok@@ u@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ restri@@ ctive damages &quot; in the shortest tool around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gi@@ os and ear@@ ns the opinion of the President of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly , makes more praise to its own behavior . &quot;
&quot; the younger of the talented duo , the younger of the talented duo , is still referred to as &quot; Special Today &quot; by the so @-@ called &quot; Special Today &quot; with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati shortly afterwards , co@@ ca@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the arbit@@ rators and proclaimed that &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have strike Kyr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; last but he was seen as he ra@@ cked a tennis ra@@ cket after a cr@@ amp defended a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , he was defended by He@@ aly ste@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I was quite en@@ vious , is the fact that after my opinion of Than@@ asi was a little over in the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he broke one ra@@ cket when he lost some of the US Open to the US Open , but he is not the first player who made a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration that he did not know that he is not proud of them . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has committed himself very well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison , and so on , I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around them , he has a great family around itself , and I think he was treated a little too closely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he fits in the team and so on , he &apos;s never going to be a problem with the other players , he &apos;s well in the changing area , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly did not take into account the decision to consider Kyr@@ gi@@ os may not consider the decision on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right for all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the contro@@ versy over all the contro@@ versy &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has done very quickly on the ascent , what people like spring and Murray is watching . he has been in the eyes of the public and because he can only think about it , but we try to think about it , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary expl@@ aining the fron@@ tier , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary explained the state of emergency and bol@@ ted the south border with Serbia on Tuesday and maintained everyone who tried to get illegal to the land . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed on the border , when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials to re@@ acted with indig@@ nation . &quot;
&quot; people , who escaped before violence , stuck for an unknown period in a land@@ marks on the road between the two Nama points of the countries and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations have increased .
&quot; as a police helicopter gun on them , the migrants &quot; displaced the border &quot; open the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot;
some of them were fallen from protest F@@ oods and water .
&quot; according to Serbia &apos;s foreign minister , it is &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants coming from Hungary would arrive while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ater@@ al@@ harm .
&quot; in the coming days , meetings will have to take talks with Brussels and other countries , &quot; said I@@ vic@@ a d@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nations block at a strict meeting in Brussels , there would be no common immigration policy . &quot;
&quot; the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who survived in the excessive Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that at the end of the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including several from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria led a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the in@@ flow crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary won &apos;t set its hopes to be in Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the Not@@ ary of Not@@ ice in two southern regions , authorities issued more auth@@ orization to imp@@ acting the crisis so that they could accelerate the streets and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ as said that his country will also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire , along its border to Romania , in order to stop the stream of immigrants from the country , after the end of a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata said that even prison in@@ mates in competitions , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia were deployed . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ ban passed , however , insi@@ sted that most of the incoming business developments are , which are searching for a better life , and non @-@ war refugees , which is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU Member States , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us who inv@@ ent the government along the southern border to Serbia , led to a crime . these laws are also sentenced to imprisonment on traff@@ icking of human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that was created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency state , &quot; states Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very much : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected for the next week , but reporter from Associated Press have already seen many armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs out of day . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country @-@ security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities flee 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others have already been extingu@@ ished in the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaged the fence , they are now in custody and are charged by the Inspec@@ torate of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws . &quot;
authorities are ready to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; in Tuesday morning , two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train car with bar@@ bed wire , in order to close the borders , had arrived . &quot;
&quot; chaos led the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container , to im@@ press the data of people and pressed a human quantity to push back there . &quot;
about 20 managed to get there but thousands stopped outside .
&quot; another group of migrants blocked the main highway lin@@ king of Serbia and Hungary , saying that they would be able to travel food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
election @-@ 2016 : Hillary Clinton flew into national survey before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders
&quot; former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton thus continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin towards the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders will win over her opposite the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton thus has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters at the previous election ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second at the second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet posted a presidential election , has supported the presidential election of 15 percent of the presidential elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the pre @-@ elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is fixed ; what candidates are to support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ t is under her choice more resistant than one of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton lost some prizes in a series of demo@@ graphic groups , while S@@ anders scored some gains . &quot;
Clinton is holding a big lead in women and air @-@ temper@@ ate but these ar@@ ches have reduced .
&quot; their support for the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is behind here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ cher benefit at democratic voters under 50 years has failed , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
but Clinton still has a lead in the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton used two @-@ digit margin before S@@ anders , but S@@ anders had a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; half of the democratic voters in the general election shall say that they were willing to support Mr. Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
one quarter would support them with some and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the can@@ did@@ acy .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are mainly inspired by her .
the views are stronger with the ones that currently Clinton don &apos;t support - only about a quarter would support them thr@@ illed .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they will support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters call this over their leader Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t is interested in an open issue , why they want to be the candidate &apos;s candidate , is the most common answer to be that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ ics , her association with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
agreement with the problems and the di@@ bility are also quoted .
&quot; as the vice president , as the vice president , the president calls for the presidency of the presidential election , 57 percent would like to see him in the presidential election - even though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if Democratic voters are asked to vote for the elections , who would be their second choice , Bi@@ den is on top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ &apos;s followers , more than half that Bi@@ den would have had their second choice far from S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decides to nomin@@ ate Bi@@ den , not for the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s Vorsprung durch Technik is increasing from 20 points with bi@@ den in competitions on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters will see Clinton as a candidate &apos;s choice with the best chances to win the election ; however this figure has sunk from 78 percent last month .
&quot; it has a distance a second during this measurement , but the percentage who has seen him as the &quot; election &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important in one of the candidates , Democratic Vot@@ ers call questions about voters . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single Democratic candidate , or a potential candidate for these voters , stands un@@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential candidates , produce good results with some important features of voters for the elections of their party . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ quality consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cut off the lead in the three candidates , with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters think that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that over S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have the opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the pre @-@ elections can generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their opinions . &quot;
&quot; for all of these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; there are questions about Hillary Clinton &apos;s personal email address and a server during the term of office for foreign affairs , most of the Democratic Vot@@ ers are pleased with their declaration in the matter and say that their opinions will not be affected . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans is now un@@ happy with their explanation , while only one @-@ third was satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came into light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans say that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy had no impact on their overall opinion of Clinton , even though 36 percent said that their opinion has not wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it mostly rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more then six of 10 who say that their views from Clinton seems worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered true and trusted , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent do they see as honest and trusted , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of the voting rights are not entitled to an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of those entitled &quot; &quot; are not tru@@ st@@ worthy and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes . &quot;
&quot; of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best suited for hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority is different from being honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of the European Democratic Vot@@ ers in the pre @-@ elections are 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves on a nationwide survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is home to the newest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; on the two candidates , half of the voters decided to fall in the new pol@@ l , and others will fall dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support nationwide b@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted by Fox News Group during the last month , up 27 % on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son enjoyed the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey showed that Car@@ son , at demo@@ graphic groups , came very well and can sur@@ pass r@@ ump free voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio , John Kas@@ ich , is defeated by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who is the lowest in the last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor A.@@ T. Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the recent CNN / OR@@ C survey , released last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support for the rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the b@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the most recent pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post showed growth clearly above Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to the rising market rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some side bodies for former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son de@@ ferred to question Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said to Io@@ wa last Saturday throughout a campaigns . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood released the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; after a student during a s@@ ik@@ an rit@@ ual of a student link in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died on M@@ ord@@ an@@ nah against five persons . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood p@@ ushes Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a demonstration in September 2013 and delayed their transportation to the hospital where he contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been bur@@ dened by connected eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack , and was attacked , while trying to draw over a frozen field on a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , he fell into consciousness . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood called not the emergency number 911 after den@@ ying and they were supposed to arrive at an hour before they brought him to a hospital such as the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to help his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to kill advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the utensils began to hide and set the br@@ otherhood of Brotherhood over the &quot; &quot; Michael Den@@ g &quot; , &quot; said Poli@@ ig@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ ener report , den@@ arius were repeated with bl@@ unter strength injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student passes the ch@@ ic@@ ans &quot; &quot; Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s Family , represented in an explanation since 1970 . &quot;
br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table and this step of authorities is very important .
&quot; a County of Grand Jury of Monroe suggested a indictment due to murder , for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; two and thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with def@@ ensive attacks and education of a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take the responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organisation , which - officially or un@@ official - that is sanc@@ tion@@ ed , so we will also move into account that &quot; &quot; Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has opposed their belonging to the scene .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; an interest profit occurs , and the house will fall into doubt , slip for bonds , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long it will stop .
especially the story of the economy does not provide low guidance for the economy .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; with the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising interest rates , it is often not always a factor in doing such as the economy and financial investments . &quot;
&quot; consequently , representatives of the U.S. bank have so strongly emphas@@ ized that investors should not focus on bringing interest rates , but rather at the time frame required for the norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , multiple variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however find that the whole excitement was possibly greatly exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inev@@ it@@ ably interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we anticip@@ ate the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal heights , but still on a low level to swing the pile , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
&quot; here is a look at historic trends , which could react to some areas of business : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen last month , there may make anticip@@ ation of zinc bank loans for a while volatile . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the raise is in , the effect is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to increase hunger @-@ income 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps again reflected the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study leading up to Zin@@ ke &apos;s statements . &quot;
&quot; more precisely in the past 35 years , the market is mostly down@@ ward - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days after a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks are commercially available in enh@@ ancing @-@ cycle and the return on equity is starting to reduce .
&quot; rec@@ itals are a fact of economic power , but they often boost zinc . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that could not speed up before and speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; notably , the Gross Dom@@ estic Product is very remarkable that its lowest point is in the F@@ ed interest rate . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 pre @-@ nominal GDP had only twice the nominal GDP of below 4.5 per cent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only few expect that this will last and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; unlike a so frag@@ ile economic setting could be ris@@ ky , asking the question if this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have formed the whole year to a rise in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were ge@@ ared to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could make an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading will have a li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all increased cycl@@ ones from 1950 to present occur in a super cycle with increasing the GDP of GDP and before re@@ alising in the sha@@ dows before re@@ alising the recession , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is clearly a lon@@ ely long recovery of what the worst recession observed in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and so far is 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also volatile , since the market occupies a zinc portion , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , R@@ end@@ ites seem to change direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Incre@@ ase cycle , arrivals drop out immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Charles Schw@@ ab , strateg@@ ists believe that the increase in the rate of interest rates will lead to closer and shorter bonds between longer and shorter bonds and to a down@@ stream of the curve . &quot;
&quot; bonds , high @-@ interest bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ eine in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the impact of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are a few signs of evidence that the market has adjusted to more str@@ ingent monetary policy , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , borro@@ wed , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed has intensi@@ fied its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and all , businesses that wrap their larger part of their business into the United States , of which interest rates are rising and local products make more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debt will be worse , as an increasing market rising in the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares thus tend to respond positively , three months after an initial rate hike exceedingly positive , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs Analy@@ est in a report for the customer . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet results in a weak balance sheet in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 , exceeding 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital expend@@ itu@@ res and low vol@@ atility at their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality each by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest will lose most , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure equity games , consumers also will benefit from the rising U.S. dollar . &quot;
&quot; spar@@ er might see gains by higher income , even if experts are in different opinion such as fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says member of the European Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of the Parliament , crit@@ ici@@ zed the transmitter for his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not able to distinguish increasingly from commercial rival .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that she im@@ ited only The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Collins used the show The Voice to and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; is turning into Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading European member state and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster , to prove that he does not do anything of the sender . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ atives of Andrew B@@ ingham said , &quot; &quot; Andrew B@@ ingham said , &quot; the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses said that publicly @-@ related radio station &quot; susp@@ ects &quot; and increasingly do not be able to distinguish from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to be converted to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so , if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you are actually only im@@ it@@ ating what &apos;s already on the market , Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director proved the alleg@@ ations , and argu@@ ed that the BBC Radio 3 was well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to the public about live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 learn , I don &apos;t want to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
&quot; and there is a commitment to live music and music playing , which is really uns@@ ur@@ passed . &quot;
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music will be found and new works on behalf , I think also really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that har@@ den had to be worked to engage in the audience as it did so in the past , because the British informed them less about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that came under the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media , and sports under fire , to enter the commercial rival on its feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory of T@@ ien Collins Carr@@ ying The Voice on - the Musical Talent Festival of the BBC , which was bought by Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media at an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
&quot; see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and is not especially striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall consisted of the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George on the BBC - &quot; produced at a special BBC fashion . &quot;
&quot; he added , he wishes to find that the enterprise &quot; &quot; a hit from our house @-@ house &quot; , &quot; when it starts the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from The Voice In the Future or to spend money of fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales went slower in August and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase online sales .
&quot; last month , the lowest result since the start of records began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales pre@@ fers three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Friday of Black Friday slow@@ ed down in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping thorou@@ gh@@ bred , and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have changed in ghost cities . &quot;
&quot; experts predi@@ ct that there are now indications that the online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed just seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the start of records in 2000 , with only five percent increase over the previous year . &quot;
experts say there are indications that online sales have stag@@ n@@ ated after new numbers shown only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you review the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ tic@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales . &quot;
&quot; it declared that online sales increased three years ago as buyers , starting with their cell phone . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; now we comm@@ utes himself , and we may possibly see that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is being quoted as a reason for a decl@@ ining sales . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event , held on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their advantage , and some tra@@ der websites rec@@ eded . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers would sl@@ ay v@@ ici@@ ously fought for bar@@ gains , could do shopping . &quot;
the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 issues had a little more than 1 £ online .
&quot; in some products like TV and washing machines , more than one @-@ third of these purchases are now operated via web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than one quarter of men sells clothing and shoes online instead of fashion chains in the interior cities .
Muslims buried the Mec@@ ca envel@@ oped in Mec@@ ca during the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the bodies of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca , driving through the streets . &quot;
Saudi Arabia causing the collapse in part of the huge Saudi @-@ Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane collapsed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were assembled , when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them who were killed , when a crane collapsed on Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ cow . &quot;
&quot; grape filled , large dressed in white , the way to cont@@ emplate their respect , when the first of the dead came up their last voyage to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession was over on the Holy Sites , where few days before a building ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then in the bed top@@ pled . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King put on the building company of the bin Laden &apos;s building site because of the catastrophe which was left with 3@@ 94 injured persons . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 Bet@@ s , who were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central Mos@@ in Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead Q@@ as@@ im was found in Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , a father of four children , who was placed on his first pilgrimage , when the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram used his parents before the start of the annual meeting in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi &apos;s officials have already admitted that the H@@ add@@ sch after Mec@@ ca will continue with thousands who continue to come to the town , will continue . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man said , the Bin Laden group did not have the arm of the crane , while he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of the decree , issued by the Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; according to the news agency , this detail was not reported in detail , but the leadership of the business travel abroad is forbidden . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man was revealed to reveal the overthrow of the crane , who crashed into a courtyard of the Great Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims fle@@ eing from the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group has not published any statements on the collapse of the cranes , and their representatives were not provided for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of non @-@ current safety measures and because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
dozens of Kr@@ kas surrounded by Mec@@ ca large mos@@ cow as part of the massive building project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the bin Laden family has been associated with the Gl@@ asses family of Saudi Arabia and takes over several construction projects .
&quot; the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Osama bin Laden , was a Ab@@ back@@ ni@@ ger son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the collapse of the crane came in the middle of strong winds and rain , just a few days before arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrims , which is at least once a healthy body . &quot;
&quot; officials said , 158 people remain in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; govern@@ ors indicates that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ ,000 ) arrived to the relatives of the killed members and the same sum of permanent injuries . &quot;

&quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said that she wants to employ more women at B &amp; Q &apos;s shop , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men conce@@ al the men . &quot;
&quot; she said that it was necessary to face the growing demo@@ graphic trends which has more female single @-@ households , more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of their decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a huge role in the decision process .
&quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index listed in the top of a British , has also carried out its top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied about 50 percent of the team with women , including his managing board and managing board . &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - there is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher also reported a decline in half @-@ year earnings and the par@@ agra@@ phs , after the Group closed the costs for closing of the stores . &quot;
&quot; because of the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
functions of a@@ I / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of court
&quot; at the Kl@@ agen@@ furt regional court , on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player a@@ ich / D@@ ob to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and inter@@ c@@ asion . &quot;
the def@@ endants pleaded not guilty .
one of them was also charged with a counterpart .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the present trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants had cryst@@ all@@ ised out in the preliminary investigation , that the def@@ endants were allowed to vote for funds of club meetings in 2006 to 2011 , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he secured the damage with around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial aid .
&quot; the Chairman of the Prosecutor , Judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , divided this fact . &quot;
it will be di@@ oc@@ oll@@ ed at a later date .
&quot; to the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represented not a period of an asset to the society . &quot;
&quot; the sports functional would have been financing for changes and the sports club to have been operating for it from 1982 to 2011 and invested in a lot of time and money from the debt - the Passi@@ va was approximately 600,000 sh@@ illing ( approximately 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time we stood in front of the situation : &quot; do we move the club further or un@@ lock ? &quot; , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the bread vocation , were the authority of the financial system . &quot;
&quot; together with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants , he then decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have borro@@ wed money to make our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; he said during the capture . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money free , only no debts will be made . &quot;
one might be on the appropriate financial success - the payout of charges for damage are retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance damage is only years later , namely from 2003 when an Plus had been out of the account . &quot;
&quot; thus , the l@@ ump sum and not detailed comments seemed to be explained , the former Ob@@ mann coun@@ tered the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and par@@ ch@@ books managed by the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
&quot; why the out@@ lay could not be explained in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association is not interested in detail for financial results , so it was only the debt of debt such as the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , when an investigation was launched against the administration of administration in 2011 , the amount of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the agreement . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not allowed to be back .
this securities current ran on the names of the accused and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement .
&quot; why ? , &quot; she wanted to judge the judge . &quot;
the case knew that for a long time no answer .
&quot; then he said , he thought that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known something of that money , the prosecutor dropped into the room . &quot;
the accused had been informed and function@@ cally the function .
this re@@ jection was form@@ ulated as &quot; compensation . &quot;
&quot; why failure ? , wanted to know the judge and the Prosecutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused began that he would not agree , because the society was never a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all out of the tail@@ or . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; he also said the function@@ ary , he never purchased a cent salary , which calcul@@ ates only o@@ dom@@ es and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; at di@@ ets he added a fee to the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenses would have been much higher than he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years could not submit the def@@ endants .
&quot; these are after an operating test in which everything was evaluated as correct , not more kept , declared them . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also referred to the second accused .
&quot; everyone wants to be in cash , and he has to be headed by his housing international market to the Bank in Abi@@ ram . he stated in his statement . &quot;
the trial will be deb@@ ated on 23 September with the statement of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard introduces further 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; in addition , since three years , the computer has been expanding further jobs with the computer branch . &quot;
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) show no end to Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to increase the exploitation of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customers . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved due to the company on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of about $ 2.7 billion that will inc@@ ur in the fourth quarter .
&quot; the dismant@@ ling of 5@@ 5,000 jobs , which has been running for three years , has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30,000 members . &quot;
the list shows the company Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Share 2.3 % .
the Califor@@ ni@@ an group of California Palo Alto are currently active : thus the computer and printing business will be bund@@ led into a new company - separated from the reporting areas with computer servers and data stored for companies as well as other services .
both operations are due to be listed on the stock exchange .

time of choice on interest rates for the US banknotes
&quot; the world is observed when the US banknotes have two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , coming together to meet the important decision whether for the first time in almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned about Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to wait a little longer and the interest rates at current rate from 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a historical event because it is seven years ago , since the F@@ ed interest earned on NU@@ LL . &quot;
&quot; for the first time we approach to a situation where a large central bank might leave the zero field and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , Head of staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , trillion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty view of global standards . &quot;
&quot; she warned the markets , facing an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step is good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday
am@@ or@@ atory on the Delta State University leaving : letter to de@@ ceased
&quot; after shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he stab@@ bed his colleagues by day and killed , Sh@@ annon examined a note to tell him that &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for him , &quot; &quot; stated public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social education at Delta State University , called the emergency number for 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , I have shot and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; with the employee of the emergency call , Lamb said that police officers must send police officers to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening . &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; swe@@ eter dog &quot; in the house , but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the call@@ ers after his name , but he did not deliver him . &quot;
Lamb didn &apos;t have any explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ lass , 41 , and a handwritten note of Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am so sorry to do it , I couldn &apos;t do it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , 300 miles from Delta State University entered the Delta State University , where he participated in E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killing his own life on Monday evening when police officers assassin@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he did not know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s conception . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ et@@ iss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities in Tuesday gave &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for an &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Shawn O &apos;@@ Ch@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years , as a &apos; good person &apos; was described . &quot;
&quot; they divor@@ ced until fifteen years ago , but they remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ab@@ iss had a daughter , the 19 is , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Raphael was working online at home , according to Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ ello from Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend . &quot;
Kno@@ w@@ le said that Pr@@ ent@@ eat who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning has been with a lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that he was called to say to a certain point on Monday , in order to say to them , &quot; he did not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; as polic@@ emen brought him to the Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later on this night , he entered his car to the side , ran away in the woods , killing themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; Lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , how his life is to be posted on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars that have lost their lucky charm

all this certainly requires its tribute .
line wings : Lufthansa builds the corporation around
the Lufthansa plans a large group of consolidated volumes .
&quot; in 2014 alone , the Lufthansa corporation will save a half billion euros by a better organisation . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the worldwide workforce of around 1,000 executives will cost the work of the workplace . &quot;

Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates European wings to the budget .

&quot; among other things , there is no longer executive board for passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ budget Euro@@ system should be developed as stand@@ by as possible .
&quot; in the end of the Executive Board , head office Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for O@@ wings to be responsible for Euro@@ s@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; with the re@@ launch , the tire menti@@ ons the importance of Euro@@ s@@ wings , which will compete in the future against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was a strong company complex . &quot;
the airline operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Gruppe - which represents an annual turnover of 30 billion euros .

Luke Shaw of Manchester United can &apos;t play for many months due to double freight
Luke Shaw is a double fra@@ cture of the right B@@ one at the Champions League Cup from Manchester to PS@@ V Eindhoven .
&quot; while this was brought to the left eye , Louis van Ga@@ al den@@ ying it that Shaw is not able to play in this season for at least six months . &quot;
the injury caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Shaw was broken in the PS@@ V area .
&quot; he was treated nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen , before he was brought to the hospital . &quot;
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg id@@ ol@@ cture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United has been very hard and then plays it fantastic , and then this happens . &quot;
he had an oxygen screen in the changing chamber .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double fra@@ cture , it will last six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red List and a suspension of a wh@@ ack .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects , that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong . &quot;
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very worse attack on both legs .
&quot; twe@@ et to Sha@@ ws account asked : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can &apos;t describe how broken me , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll be back again . &quot;
between this : Manchester United has suffered the loss of Luke Shaw at the defeat at the PS@@ V
the England Defen@@ ders has added an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship to recover until upcoming June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very aw@@ ful case . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves for this type of injury to the square , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an enemy .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al as the Netherlands team at the World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he does very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the enemy , and if you then hear that it &apos;s a very aw@@ ful case , this is not good , &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was not possible to see the moment . &quot;
&quot; the only thing that I could see was the ball , who was moving in another direction , so it looked like if he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad here . I &apos;m so sorry .
&quot; the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital , by a f@@ oul@@ ume by Chris Sm@@ alling . &quot;
certainly knows David Cameron The bay better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; unless you , you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; when he was asked by a supplier of child@@ care systems , his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book was asked , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax participated in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice but Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camp , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book I like to give to my children , because it still seems to have a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all well and good , except that the subsequent ship@@ ments in which Cameron allegedly describes the action of the book , instead returns to expand one component of the 2012 film version , giving new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the w@@ alled city of Th@@ urg@@ y Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl of his dreams , reads , &quot; &quot; reads a love affair , whose real name was given by Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el . it was completely unknown in 1991 . &quot;
&quot; as if this was not susp@@ icious enough : the text presented by Cameron stands in part like the Sum@@ mary of the Lord Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , to win the girl his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he admit to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems likely that Cameron speaking the plot of the book is so little familiar , like the local environmental stimul@@ ating the trees dedicated to the name of the nam@@ ent Lor@@ ax , a hol@@ low , sle@@ ur@@ b@@ ish being , &quot; that is laid on the name of trees . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to one helper that the bay hadn &apos;t read 20 times in succession in a child . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street speech manager told the text might probably have been by Cam@@ er@@ ons Ele@@ ction Circuit .
&quot; absolute camps confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but gave no immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th is definitely threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s crew but it is still difficult
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the squ@@ ash that has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map . &quot;
I would not succeed an out@@ ward victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the game &apos;s play , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear a juven@@ ile sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a teen @-@ positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on the test plane , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; this is our message : Adam Ly@@ th de@@ parts from the England @-@ test cad@@ res , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , hard to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ ck@@ et@@ player is ge@@ ared to outcomes . &quot;
&quot; there was no question@@ ing for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to nomin@@ ation , as - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , I had extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; starting hopefully further runs of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ essen praised his post@@ ure even if he didn &apos;t give so good performance , and it surprised me ; he is mainly a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; question , how much time a test player gets to get his character is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th got seven chances - as Sam Rob@@ son got ahead of him while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on nine received .
just Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and downhill run .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation which I could raise , was that England initially stood Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
Alex H@@ ales is coming in and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I highly assessed .
he &apos;s a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he found 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge - what met us very much .
&quot; he has to pay at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends on team effort to launch in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would get an extra @-@ in Bow@@ ler and four Qu@@ icks were di@@ pping up and I found nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz@@ man can &apos;t beat there and this link has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s v@@ ector of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een has not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 testing of the first Drop when he joined the op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is born in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up Sp@@ inner , and in my limited partnership with him he impressed me very much . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inning that will ex@@ to@@ l their hands and the train@@ ers have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew the England has played a few more smart tickets at train@@ ee .
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ nes , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , became an advisor for the trial games could be a fol@@ lower . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is playing for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has int@@ entions to benefit from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the dressing cabin can still bring fresh breeze , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ ys &apos;s team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the one @-@ Day@@ ton , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team actors don &apos;t determine the schedule . &quot;
and you &apos;ll have to think that as with the players take off their jobs of the results .
such decisions are not made easy hearts .
&quot; a Bre@@ xit camp ( Bre@@ xit = exit @-@ Great Britain from the EU ) might be able to win , if the economy runs into a Fl@@ au@@ der , by 2017 . &quot;
&quot; David Cam@@ er@@ on &apos;s un@@ paid new negoti@@ ator strategy to keep Britain in the EU will fall into trouble with each day , even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ bit@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who was severely crushed for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
we also have their Cor@@ bit@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at , saying to the fact that several member states , so deeply ent@@ ails in several crises such as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , UK itself produced Agenda with mir@@ r@@ ammed conc@@ essions and distur@@ bing changes that are mostly non @-@ fed . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided to vote on its annual meeting that it does not like this to end@@ anger the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers climbing a summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , a photograph of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home to and say that they are allies of allies . &quot;
it always goes around me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside the Great Britain inside the EU @-@ tent - &quot; Don &apos;t leave us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and we see that more and more sight@@ se@@ ein@@ ous ministers must come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we remain or go . &quot;
Germany &apos;s auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally and she has been in power for 10 years before he wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them as it would happen for the excessive burden like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) and Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande will look back on its re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ wning effect .
&quot; Poland probably soon had a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that they will pull off a leg to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , their energy should not be used to prevent their energy from the UK - something that they do not want to do because most of the similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies did . &quot;
&quot; hence , some such ministers may plan not to be helpful any more helpful notes , in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain exp@@ ires 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the re @-@ hearing was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Britain has won none of the negoti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how profitable the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ one as they did not work during the 1975 Tony Ben@@ n inspired by our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; it may remind you of Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opp@@ ort@@ ality , who made a name as a &quot; EU Straight ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s . &quot;
&quot; during all his de@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; the Med@@ ley belonged to tax @-@ prin@@ c@@ essions , telephone @-@ h@@ aul ali@@ ens and the p@@ seudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who have most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air actually thought about it , but noted that if you sit down with a hot Gor@@ illa in a cage , it is better ban@@ anas to di@@ stra@@ ct him , rather than to prepare for lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans than Bl@@ air himself , when he opposed the refer@@ end@@ on of the EU , because Bl@@ air had rejected the principle above the not adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a back@@ door . &quot;
&quot; the press never did it , too . &quot;
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ bit@@ n , who gave me a friendly cli@@ p@@ or on the back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he had no time to re@@ iter@@ ate me - seems to repeat the 80 &quot; s in danger , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa left he on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe is - I &apos;ll put it kind - in development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside the U@@ ki@@ p traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ stock trend and the wild beasts of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can probably say yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; one Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite of Ben@@ n in the radio and TV this week said that the boy sc@@ outs had fought in him , not admit that Cor@@ bit@@ ns &apos;s appointment as a Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler had a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; he remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ s , when his old father beha@@ ved himself in television to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet Centre without going too far and losing his cabin job . &quot;
Hil@@ ary &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; Benn@@ s expressed - that what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , was saying what J@@ C told his fel@@ low@@ soldier and members after all of the reports on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching sel@@ tom @-@ up image of Cor@@ bit@@ n wants to say , remember that it even has touched me - news discipline remains in the age of TV around the clock , and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allowed him to keep your fo@@ urs support in the refer@@ end@@ um for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ bit@@ ns fundamental clear@@ ness of EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Bel@@ ager@@ ess @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion under the left @-@ president of the little difference being a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ ly convinced that J@@ C will not leave any campaign to the outlet , will be inde@@ b@@ ted to try foreign diplom@@ ats in all to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn on political capital - they also have mi@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be any int@@ oler@@ able ?
&quot; the USA are already quite disappointed in the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government on the power of what I was remin@@ ded of something which was called by British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health of England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less dam@@ aging than smoking , from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who registered in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined by public health by public health ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he published the &quot; Basic Meeting &quot; last month , and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive assessment of evidence . &quot; &quot;
but some researchers have asked the capacity of the data in@@ qu@@ ire and referred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ arily long basis &quot; on the hunt of his main conclusion .
two more researchers have written in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Relations at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of P@@ he is that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less dam@@ aging than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who have been called to develop a model for multiple criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to produce their opinions on the damage caused by various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting held a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managers have previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained the resources of a e @-@ cigarettes business , but not the financing which he will receive after reports earlier by the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the tobacco line also took part in the meeting .
&quot; the Group &apos;s research group &quot; &quot; refers to a &quot; &quot; lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria . &quot; did Mc@@ K@@ ee wrote and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
however no of these links or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there is no evidence that there is no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes have been as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well@@ being at P@@ he said , had already responded to the claims of BM@@ J . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are significantly less dam@@ aging than smoking . &quot;
every second lif@@ eller dies on his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the unique obligation to provide the information of public about what the evidence shows and what does not , especially when there are so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80,000 people die annually on a patient with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health system two billion dollars a year . &quot;
&quot; by clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national responsibilities . &quot;
&quot; BBC should leave East@@ ener@@ ey , former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said , the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ ener@@ ey and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give your right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio costs should only be used to make the type of programs , which are not broadcast by other UK channels . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he critic@@ ised the BBC for becoming public @-@ legal programs that probably can be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time@@ frames against the most popular shows of their rival and radio stations such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in his time near Channel 4 with no success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on order or send them clearly not sub@@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; &quot; Johnson said the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio charge , what I think or do not hold for a good idea , you should at least make his production least on programs that others do not do or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window , because they want to achieve the least broad support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax schemes may be financed without subsidi@@ zation .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , per@@ mitt@@ edly both own self @-@ productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
try to see how public TV is supposed to be public TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , a business@@ man for the series , the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence on Hun@@ ting Reviews may be &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people working there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will return this again , which was the ex @-@ director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart presentation at Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that they should not be able to go to the BB@@ C4 , where they do not measure the audience , but they are able to argue that if they are based on their apparent missions for sp@@ assing 4 billions of 1,000 radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they place them in a time window , in which no one ever wanted to see them . &quot;
Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more legal system in terms of conditions that can get the best value .
&quot; of course , think all of you think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me whether this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 boss David El@@ stein , who also stated before the committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC should review their ri@@ m@@ ian mission , to educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain them . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would now officially be classified as a education , and he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should look forward to the publicly @-@ supported television channel in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; to the question of partnerships , El@@ stone , the BBC should do more in areas like the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be shown , and with the commercial Sen@@ ators alli@@ ances meet to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ A@@ homogen@@ e@@ Genetics &apos; can control brain cells through b@@ ading waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des will alter the direction in which it ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound@@ waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment , in which it have high frequencies for the human hearing , to be heard , ir@@ radi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; impul@@ ses are done by an in@@ switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultr@@ asound . &quot;
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said , the worms showed the power of a new procedure called &quot; &quot; Son@@ e@@ Genetics &quot; &quot; used in ultr@@ asound to activate a number of bra@@ ins , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ć@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the process of one day could replace the approaches of Hirn@@ ger@@ ulation to reduce electrical impul@@ ses in the brain of people for treating Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; mer@@ cil@@ it@@ ators don &apos;t react on ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , which then penet@@ rate the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultr@@ asonic sensors will be present on structures , the TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion@@ can@@ als , and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the worms cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves ro@@ ars the opening of these icons and activate the cells where they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound advanced n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their motorbike subjects are TR@@ P @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; when using ultr@@ asound on the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ waves and transferred to the worms where they turn the changed mot@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to turn neur@@ ons with impul@@ ses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ e@@ Genetics could have some advantages compared to this technology .
&quot; in contrast to light requiring an optical fiber to the desired position in the brain , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound tissues could pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with the therapy and therapeutic data it is possible that de@@ pr@@ er@@ ated human neur@@ ons are p@@ liable for the ultr@@ asound signal in an clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logic treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP Creative director Matt L@@ ever was surprised about the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade , and thinking : &quot; let us give them the campaign that they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic delicate course , but &quot; due to the f@@ ading with bright colours and animation . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job , by helping us to def@@ use the knowledge about the sale of illegal torture apparatus at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
&quot; what we need now is a step of the British government , and the guarantee that the ant@@ it@@ ers will not be tra@@ pped in front of our door@@ step . &quot;

&quot; eight Gold rules for life in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence at a student residence , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and mor@@ ale Rel@@ ati@@ vism , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those that I have been sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting consequences of others . &quot;
most of the things I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residence is enough to be frigh@@ tening up to absolutely sho@@ ck@@ elling .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to wi@@ pes : people tell whence you come from where you come in regards to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you say &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in Ernst , guys , it is just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; the conversation points us and helps you to find out people who like to find them unlike those of which you would not speak , even if your l@@ ashes were in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let human beings do .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film @-@ night venues and public meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
this is related : do not think to start at the university with a relationship .
Intro@@ duc@@ ts get a major treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence take a room @-@ to @-@ room @-@ bum@@ ble culture , which can be friendly and soci@@ ally and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing is allowed in the culture to say to you : &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship , but you have to go back to get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a com@@ edy of soci@@ ability is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead .
ap@@ rop@@ os so@@ aps : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that a no locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
join friendship with B@@ aking .
&quot; as you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the clo@@ cks is at the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to pack you . so , and now please smile , if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats are a good way to complete friend@@ ships .
&quot; their ro@@ omm@@ ates feel comm@@ ited to enter@@ tain , and will associate your face with a delicious surprise at the end . &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a temporary b@@ aker .
&quot; badly mixed clothes with flour , sugar and fat make them sleeping , for people sleep rou@@ gh@@ ill . &quot;
&quot; ste@@ aling food , a common crime in student residence halls . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cl@@ a@@ ws of hen is a ste@@ aling , but is it lawful take a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; opportunities are good , they say , they say , even if they cook inside the inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion , but try to get more balanced than my fellow resident who added a deter@@ sive agent to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in jail .
&quot; you should not make any noise , the people keep away from sleep or work . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a permanent man , but that in the true sense of the saying to people , they are sitting in the glass of gl@@ ass@@ els . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall asked her neighbours as if it makes them a little more quiet , Drum &amp; Bass makes a little more quiet , since at three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it even lou@@ dly music .
&quot; finally , when they heard about 5 o &apos;clock , they had to sleep in their neighbors even two hours before they left their own music , shut down her door and came to a three @-@ hour test . &quot;
&quot; wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would happen to be into the same student residence ? &quot;
&quot; the other way around is it not exhau@@ sting for you , if you have a contribut@@ or to their future wife partnerships to take part in them , and they &apos;ll have to see each day , and perhaps experience as they bring together all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; naturally , the heart goes its own path@@ ways - but if a god co @-@ inhabit@@ ant definitely isn &apos;t your future wife partner , try to talk a little reason to your abdom@@ en . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its not closed room , the limit is between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing finely as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good soldier is funny , but it takes just moments until it gets bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; easily share a valuable and am@@ using lesson through security - but never fails , any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo . &quot;
&quot; join your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will then place into the freezer , but do not ack@@ et your possessions at the ceiling longer than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , all@@ ot@@ ting and straight @-@ den@@ ers &quot;
&quot; the real estate agent , Markus Gil@@ dner , build in the middle Fran@@ con@@ ian corner houses for people who have not much money . &quot;
&quot; hence , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need dor@@ man@@ t , but just as well as those who are deser@@ ved alone . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show how you can still win and well @-@ build today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are p@@ ushing onto the housing market .
&quot; in a project , the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner wants to know how quickly private living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees . &quot;
Mr. Gil@@ dner and many of the refugees dro@@ pping onto the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the measure of large container in containers or turn@@ around has no sustainability .
for people staying in a large part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient space for decades in the coming decades . &quot;
a single @-@ band terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least place .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
it is different when you put people in blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three units of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; every residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be converted to the respective needs . &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction lasted only six months .
that is reasonable .
have the construction regulations difficult ?
Gil@@ dner : I did not use my project correctly .
it always makes it difficult for the dro@@ pping generation of women and the plac@@ e@@ plac@@ ements .
gr@@ assy .
it will always under@@ line who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating a luxury building for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely not right .
but are you unable to compete in competitions ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true : we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but build luxury apartments that hardly can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need changing room . &quot;
&quot; not just fug@@ iti@@ ves , but just as the Mother of Ger@@ sh@@ ing@@ ian alone . &quot;
I &apos;ll show how you can build and well @-@ build today .
this is why it goes .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the sett@@ ling app , select &quot; General &quot; and then &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;

&quot; some are going to be encountered after installation , as they get an error message that mitt@@ ing that the &quot; Software @-@ update is missing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to wait either to wait until the attack goes back or to try to update via iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself leads you through the rest of the process .
&quot; it may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to create room - but Apple has made it easier to do with the release of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to delete it , and to re @-@ install it once the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during updating , or near a loading device , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple leaves not allow the update to be continued because the phone might be switched on half @-@ way and this could lead to a demol@@ ition of updates . &quot;

&quot; we always had in mind that the Mül@@ lers should fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen , and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was done , I simply called it . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the idea of the couple Müller was pleased to conduct their own practice in As@@ endorf . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the permanent contact to the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know , and accompany the families over the years . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also lifted up on our southern border , &quot; said Minister for Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border stands in parallel to this .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to place an asylum request has also &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and security of the people are in the fore@@ ground .
but it is clear that it doesn &apos;t need clear signals . &quot; the Minister said .
&quot; people need to know that , beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border , people will not accept such flows . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia has taken care of &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would continue to continue in direction of refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under conditions Cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Minister for Internal Affairs , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors was &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially towards Hungary . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia must be exceeding strong as the border of the Schengen Area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slo@@ veni@@ ans want to add up its limitations for refugees but not abri@@ dging . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; the Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ y Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried to arrive during the night hours to Tuesday during the northern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to avoid the registration of the registration . &quot;
she was able to store the Croatian police in the near maize fields .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , police cars continually meets with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; primarily by Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them many women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees , former Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo from the Maced@@ onian Serbian border , which had brought to the Hungarian border so far , would match the Croatian border , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade still denied that it is impossible to propose a certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor want to do this , &quot; &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in any case the first bus had arrived at S@@ id around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , during the day more buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; across Croatia , Slovenia and Austria after Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were traveling the whole night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia , some 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made it , so the police have told us that we are to go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; by the ob@@ serving ob@@ servers the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary can now move on to a little further west of the circuit . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; extensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; in Croatia , the Minister of the Interior , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic proposed that his country for the fall of a strong thrust of refugees have prepared the appropriate plans for possible ex@@ changes . &quot;
&quot; details could not be mentioned , but he pointed out that Croatia could be a non @-@ Schengen Member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for the border control . &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , with the EU partners since 2007 , consistently followed a good report of what concerns the standard of border controls . &quot;
on Serbian people still stuck behind the Hungarian border over 300 refugees .
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves wanted to travel to the Croatian border , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
the Serbian minister of the Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was attempted to calm Wednesday early in a local eye of Hor@@ gos . he keeps the debate about aging rou@@ ters from refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed .
it would not deal with high refugee benefits at present .
&quot; they could not say if they would continue their journey via Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot;
helper @-@ helping migrants to - dangerous - Alternative linked rou@@ ters
&quot; however , private hung@@ arian refugees have already begun to distribute refugees to refugees in which alternative routes are dra@@ fted by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border region there are still 20 years after the conflict of Croatia , there is still no greater min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine employees was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; in this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set out 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share dropped by more than 2.5 per cent at pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Ahmed said to deserve a prize of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 in the financial year , which will end up to 20 cents less than at the previous forecast . &quot;
analysts were expected according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the smaller view is increasing in spite of the price increases , the average 4.9 percent and on January 4 are effectively raised and despite increases for ground clearance of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that , compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and due to growth in online trade , the company expected . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves a solid earnings , if one expects to be weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , in consideration . &quot;
&quot; the plans for vacation @-@ employment have been announced a day later than the current rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , Fed@@ Ex again earned $ 9@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;

its sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion dollars .

but the online shopping experience has boo@@ sted the results from Fed@@ Ex @-@ shop .
&quot; during the last quarter , sales rose by 29 percent , but the operating result was almost flat due to higher costs for larger pack@@ ets and self @-@ insurance . &quot;

&quot; for pre @-@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent of losses for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; two days spent at the most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ists have sitting around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras @-@ Mah@@ ag@@ oni @-@ table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; above them at the end of the emb@@ ell@@ ished , two @-@ story sitting seating there is a mur@@ al of the United States . &quot;
&quot; the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chair , Jan@@ et L. Y@@ els and their colleagues are to face the economic interests of the nation before all other things . &quot;
the central bank has a two @-@ fold assignment of the congress : maxim@@ ise the US employment and prices here stable .
&quot; since the great recession , F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a current third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate could be revealed by the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to we@@ aken by an unprecedented interest rate due to zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they might have a solid increase , the latest turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets conc@@ el@@ ably do this vol@@ atility by raising the interest rate for federal payments - and it is also just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first place is the most important thing they are watching , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , director at the Mak@@ ing firm , Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think , if they were looking for a pre@@ text , not raise the interest rate , increased safety of security around the global market enough justi@@ fication , still further said , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed is going to do in themselves the financial market .
some half of econom@@ ists who were recently interviewed by Bloomberg reported a points of interest this week .
&quot; financial markets however expect to wait a down@@ ward , with a key indi@@ ct@@ ator that is only a 30 % chance to increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the equity market , if the F@@ ed raises the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists beat the blow because they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones achieved an average average of 2@@ 28@@ 89 points or 1,4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was caused by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in case of doing it , they would have to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they may not fall into panic . &quot;
other experts argu@@ ed that a loss of interest would put down the financial markets because it imp@@ ure the un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed should act .
&quot; one month ago , F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow con@@ vocation of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in the spring and early summer of summer , Y@@ ellen had said that this year , despite the effects of Liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase of the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of job positions were slow@@ ed down in August , improvement in employment grew solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % over the past month , the lowest for over seven years and close to levels that the F@@ ed could be employed as full employment . &quot;
wage differentiation have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation is constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives reported that the main reason is the temporary effect of distin@@ ctly higher oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs them through the stress on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on M. &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world looked at the end of the month after China had dismant@@ led his currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Sustainability Average score in May by more than 16 % below its highest level , investors ruled that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would lead the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly in this month , and the Dow Jones is now close to 10 % below the host of May . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ed representative , the market turbul@@ ences influence the complex lim@@ ulation when to increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the messages about the weakness of the Chinese economy could not appear in the past couple of weeks , said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an ex @-@ employee of US banknotes . &quot;
&quot; now he pre@@ dicts that they will wait at least one month , in order to get the effects better in the handle . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; O@@ liner said . &quot;
&quot; global economy is not one of the main areas of the F@@ ed , so it should technically not be included in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end that the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank was huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere indication of the then Chief Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed can &quot; &quot; close their mon@@ et@@ ages expansion &quot; &quot; triggered confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined by the F@@ ed representative , they can not only monitor the developments at other sites but also advis@@ ing some better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; Zac@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for the assets management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc . , policy @-@ making is more art than science . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; F@@ ed has a history of over@@ inter@@ actions on financial market movements , which apparently not associated with the economic foundations . &quot;
&quot; h@@ acker , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , set up for a Zin@@ c link , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its conduc@@ tivity in the US by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited recogni@@ zable impact on growth in the US , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ Represent@@ atives made this cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed should have aspects of financial stability despite a severe crisis , such as the market sl@@ ump in 2008 , said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest Tur@@ bul@@ ance does not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation , in which she feared a interest rate because the markets remained exciting , &quot; said Poz@@ nan , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the Financial St@@ ability , and until that is changed , I do not think it should take time ahead . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ lau@@ da : little Life Assi@@ stance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
a warm welcome to prepare a warm welcome is not due to the commitment of many volunteers .
there are also quite a number of people who support the unlimited asylum seek@@ ers in the city too .
he among them is Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a trainer and a soul teacher .
she also teaches with her 74 L@@ ences to still enjoy .
every Thursday they do it in the asylum seek@@ ers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Strasse .
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo , and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is quite different lessons as at a right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; S@@ RS tried to clari@@ fy the Brazilian hot@@ line organization S@@ RS , on sho@@ cking their way women &apos;s about how important nour@@ ishing food during breast@@ feeding is . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that are painted with presentations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies every nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , wa@@ vering and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ oric intake does not lead the only dietary change to make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet pregnant women really affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the child &apos;s un@@ healthy eating habits may neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the New Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
&quot; the municipal council of Bern@@ ried , the building application for the 2.3 million euros in sports hall . &quot;
and he did an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ sigh@@ ted turn@@ around at the amber of sports was advanced by step forward : in the recent municipal discussion , the elabor@@ ated building application has been broken down without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the Committee had issued an application for a further legal &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; of the valid construction plan . &quot;
with the &quot; exception &quot; the permission to permit a special form to the roof structure .
accordingly a &quot; ar@@ tic @-@ roof with non @-@ mit@@ er first and roof overhead &quot; is to be built .
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof for solar plants : &quot; &quot; thereby we get a wonder@@ fully large shelter , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Liberation , &quot; the roof of the roof , which should be mandatory for energ@@ y- and energetic reasons - is strictly prohibited in the development plan below 10 degrees . &quot;
this is clearly reduced in the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof@@ ing was no &quot; exceptions . &quot; if the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally exemp@@ ted from restri@@ ctive applications for the liberation of liberation .
&quot; however , the turn@@ around is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; by doing so . &quot;
the Turn@@ halle at the sports centre is a community project for the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at cost , approximately 2.3 million euros are calculated . &quot;
snap@@ shots are expected from the school and development promotion .
&quot; in the next basic step , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres of Halle will now be submitted to the coun@@ sell@@ or to the test . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to D@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed early as planned - for 2016 .
at the same time Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) became the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH in the district of Land@@ kre@@ was , in front of the land@@ slides by Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; but a decision on the supervisory board is due to meet the supervisory board , and the decision on Wednesday 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are to be implemented , all of the 50 employees would be busy at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority ran with Fischer and the still existing inner inside to D@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , are to be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim or so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the beginning of medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Clinic and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the question of who should compete , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man , &quot; came to the play , who was willing to take over the line on October 1st and will altern@@ ate with his team at Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; in case of a house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of Internal Medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; at the next two years Fischer with his team , when the Supervisory Board decides to continue the short@@ age of the two houses , until the next year the former hospital in the Kn@@ app@@ hi@@ kers , which has just over 35 beds , will be finally closed for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Landkreis has planned this forecast for 2018 , when the current renovation was completed at the hospital in W@@ eil@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , went to meet the President , suggest@@ ing the house which is in possession of the Federal Reserve , will be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the close I go out . as it goes on to the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ white could not say that there are several thoughts . &quot;
at the moment there are a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; says fishermen over the p@@ seudo @-@ moving to the Le@@ ch , which was claimed by the staff &quot; positively and very understand@@ able &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective of the house , where fishermen had worked for more than 30 years ago , I didn &apos;t give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take up the post of the director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened again by closure , departments became closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
the hands of the Rhein @-@ Neckar and the Rhein @-@ Neckar are required this evening ( 20.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; although the lead manager of the Bundesliga in Wuppertal is the clear Favor@@ it , however , there is none . &quot;
&quot; during the past season , Bad@@ ians at the B@@ HC have a painful defeat and still have some rub@@ b@@ ish there . &quot;
hunting with two injured persons at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their corn crop on Tuesday morning by shots .
&quot; during the aber@@ ration on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Landkreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hun@@ ts@@ man were in use as the police had ha@@ sten@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a final call , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as it happened to the accident , first of all , was un@@ clear . &quot;
the police were determined .
16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate for violent crimes
a crime @-@ susp@@ icious police have led the police to the dead of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the interro@@ gation of the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people had been killed and had cast their car@@ che out into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 year old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is fallen victim to a victim .
&quot; the young wife &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like public prosecutor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a man of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , indeed , regarded as a actively energi@@ zed and investig@@ ators to investig@@ ators the investig@@ ators to the discovery of the temporary cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old has been reported on Sunday morning , after she did not come home after a visit to a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; when searching for the young woman , investig@@ ators first look into the victim &apos;s personal items . &quot;
&quot; in the circle of friends with friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , they found a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the monks were found . &quot;
&quot; according to the interro@@ gation , the authorities were interro@@ gated in custody by the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and have laid the body in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be brought forward to the port hop@@ per , and investig@@ ators will give him a burden to him . &quot;
&quot; in addition to further circumstances , the further investigation is to be investigated . &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warns of residential homes
the location on the German residential property market is ten@@ se .
even more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is one challenge .
the distribution progress on the German residential property market has long ago .
&quot; with the approaching refugees and unemployed people from the EU , more people push for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many major cities . &quot;
they compet@@ ed with income @-@ income citizens to the last paid flats .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , it would have to be built up to 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
the result is a study commissioned by the &quot; social housing &quot; ban .
&quot; in comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; to this , 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in a first use accommodation . &quot;
many of them pe@@ aking at the housing market and line the long queu@@ es in front of the ten@@ ement park .
&quot; according to the Statistics Office , however , less than half of the asylum seek@@ ers were booked in last year . &quot;
however the negative development of the housing market is not just because of the rising refugees .
the study also makes significant deteri@@ oration in the history of private homes in recent years .
Germany fir@@ ing a H@@ ousing deficit to get bigger the year by year .
&quot; currently more than 77@@ 0,000 housing units were already missing in the urban areas , Matthias Günther compl@@ ained of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many experienced professionals in the capit@@ als lived in shel@@ tered rooms in shel@@ tered rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed in the housing market un@@ will@@ ingly for a longer time in the &quot; Hotel M@@ om . &quot;
&quot; in major cities , the number of square metres per capita has decreased in the past years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; Social housing &quot; strikes a re@@ boot . &quot;
new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to stim@@ ulate the social housing construction .
&quot; for example , the property tax rate could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax for funded flats might be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the alliance offers attractive pre @-@ tax depreciation possibilities . &quot;
&quot; now , the funding program of the state bank Kf@@ W is now working well with cities and municipalities . &quot;
&quot; a good week after the start was announced on Monday evening , with € 184 million , more than half of the € 300 million available . &quot;
now the project could even be sc@@ aled .
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia itself in the corridor
&quot; according to Hungary , practically non @-@ searches , since then more refugees have the path over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the return trip through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; the it@@ iner@@ ary is dangerous , though . &quot;
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister for Minister , and if necessary , we will arrange a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already on the Schengen area .
the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; according to the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees exp@@ elled to Croatia to arrive from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have arrived on the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel reported . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees at the day before .
new laws adopted on the same day would seem superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to happen for refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic stated : &quot; they can go through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police seized the Croatian border on Serbia &apos;s border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most types of media reports , according to media reports , from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; they arrived by bus and taxi , and by taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id . &quot;
&quot; directly after their arrival , they tried to walk down the green border to Croatia by foot . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serb border , the refugees don &apos;t encounter f@@ ences . &quot;
this causes the border crossing other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields are to quickly create a secure passage .
&quot; after Hungary , after closing the border , there are hardly any more refugees . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 fierce people . &quot;
&quot; shortly before the closing on Monday , there were only 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws under@@ take the over@@ coming and damage of the limit on us as an off@@ ence .
&quot; consequently , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
sentenced to five years imprisonment and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the in@@ flow hall , a total of 94 applications were indicated on Tuesday in the newly instit@@ uted &quot; &quot; Tran@@ wns &quot; &quot; border , including almost all of them - 93 - at the main transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; 13 families with small children , as well as two older persons . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
&quot; in practice , no one has a view to granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
asylum seek@@ ers must be deported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sa@@ one &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees came together . &quot;
workers began to plu@@ ck up workers in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish with the tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks .
bul@@ lock were min@@ ed and one of the shooting camps at the border was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express this reconstruction .
Austria after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but around 20,000 migrants were still standing in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train service from there to Germany was stopped on the morning by the German authorities .
in Freil@@ assing each regularly visited smaller groups of refugees .
Mayor of the &quot; Group &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy as a bridge on Sunday with the reception , when suddenly ten people with travel off@@ s at the entrance of the tent there , &quot; says V@@ ern@@ st@@ one Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists wanted to go by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; because Germany happened un@@ expect@@ edly on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , was in W@@ ern@@ stein finally , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before that , we first ass@@ aul@@ ted the genuine guest only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
we said it right away . we bring it by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; of course , it was for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a certain man was allowed to receive a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very happy with us , &quot; says the city . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels , the con@@ gest@@ ed train connections went to Wels from a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to escape it after the short term , however , that railway traffic was stopped after Germany . &quot;
the regional train was turned off at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border is generally high on the course .
&quot; the bridge festival with the Bavarian neighbours is soci@@ able on Sunday , a day before a branch - organized by Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; if Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is sending for further en@@ ig@@ en@@ nia , it is a logical result of the apparent field of evidence . &quot;
&quot; rather than in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately at the construction of structures , Human@@ ity has advanced and publicly tra@@ ded the attitude of Hungarian government to the Dun@@ st@@ ee of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
mis@@ carrying these policy are not only those Austri@@ ans being confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; the sought @-@ out may also have to state that the &quot; yel@@ ob@@ bled land , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , has nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; a major challenge shall be a major challenge , given the persistent refugees and of the outstanding wind to produce decent conditions for protective seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be an even bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35,000 new well @-@ proven Qu@@ arti@@ eren &quot;
Konrad has filled up all hands with the refugee of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to see that his word has a weight .
the government has used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen @-@ Ban@@ ker to expos@@ e Qu@@ arti@@ ere for thousands of refugees .
&quot; finally , the chaos in the first entrance center Tra@@ is@@ kir@@ has already received the handle in Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; finally , the placing of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday had been without a great host , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Master &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Interior Ministry spoke of a &quot; cra@@ cked situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; altogether , Konrad with an needs of 8@@ 5,000 quarters were calculated in the he@@ ur@@ ly year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfill the number , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the state capit@@ als , he has already held meetings . &quot;
they had been assured that they were also preparing for the upcoming refugees cr@@ un@@ ners .
&quot; it &apos;s going well in Lower Austria , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ C@@ atar is also supported .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born , this should be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
great expectations are the asylum @-@ coordin@@ ator even as the ORF @-@ action &quot; Hel@@ ping as we . &quot;
private people can offer non @-@ complicated accommodations at the platform .
it is also hop@@ ed for hotels that have been vac@@ ant in winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high &quot; yesterday .
&quot; in not@@ ary times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ts must comply with certain height of hand@@ writing holders or the size of the duties . &quot;
for temporary temporary time &quot; not@@ ices &quot; would have to apply .
&quot; contrary to the ministry of the Interior Ministry on accommodation , Konrad with his experience is successful . &quot;
I am an older gent@@ leman to talk about un@@ truth without further into the face .
persu@@ asion force is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er caused the Republic to no cost as they declared themselves .
their number is to raise them up to three to four .
the own rate of Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ting was still not successful yet .
Konrad wanted to place a container at st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as office .
but are there problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better split
&quot; just an opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees , the City of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is currently not necessary because the person could under@@ take these measures without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of emergency , further locations must be checked on their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the city of refugees in the partition of the refugees within the Bundes@@ land .
other districts have to contribute here .
See@@ hofer : &quot; borders will not be sealed &quot;
&quot; in a long phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( CS@@ U ) has executed further progress on the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
See@@ hofer taught me that the German borders will not be sealed .
continuing in order to continue refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany .
&quot; however , there is the appropriate border controls . &quot;
there will be no more places with refugees to Germany anymore .
the protective search would however be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ ners once again challenged more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria leads over its borders to inspec@@ tions , is a logical sequence for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; as a logical result &quot; out of the fore@@ going of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time .
the refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed .
&quot; in four out of the six floors of office and production facilities , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is to be leased to young , innovative companies from the Technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT are the wise heads of our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard , and later it would be ac@@ qui@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - although in@@ advert@@ ently promises much : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the facility , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , Austria Lower Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; as of Linz AG , the building is available for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center . &quot;
&quot; more than 30 percent of 2700 square meters of bed in the building are already let , for a further 40 percent give it inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ controller opened second business in the Ark@@ ad
on the new shop cat@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags stand at the centre .
she wanted to learn J@@ utta Bre@@ it a dog .
&quot; this project had to cut down the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the ta@@ vern market . finally , an additional increase in the form of another business was created . &quot;
&quot; in the for@@ mid@@ range , compared to the business , in which she sells bags , bags , shoes and clothing of several manufacturers , everything is now about ladies &apos;s hand@@ bags from the &apos; mo@@ ck &apos; brand , wall@@ ets are starting at 75 euros . &quot;
large bags and accessories are up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; I have to say that if I was still open a shop , &quot; Bre@@ it says . &quot;
&quot; the decision was also crucial for the decision to make the fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of their own site in which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only one who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been cra@@ dle of her mother in the cra@@ dle .
it &apos;s the most when developing a bit and I can show new trends at high @-@ performance prices .
&quot; why such a woman , when looking back on a beautiful hand@@ bag in fi@@ xation tool , also can not answer the specialist with last safety . &quot;
&quot; maybe it is , that a beautiful bag is refined with each out@@ fit . &quot;
the med@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the oldest ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose residents shall be called an@@ cho@@ res . &quot;
this property also un@@ ites billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he expresses himself foreign , journalists or knowledge of knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the presidential campaign will be ag@@ itated on the election campaign . &quot;
and Far@@ ms well .
that will also be registered in the Tha@@ el@@ z@@ h@@ ort City where the grand@@ parents were in the real estate of the real estate .
the New Yorker with the F@@ öh@@ ny is many in the wine village at the Wine Route .
shel@@ tering at the 1200 habit@@ ants @-@ place is more than -@@ ty corners with him related .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz , Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what are the vill@@ agers about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that &apos;s pretty exciting , but they &apos;re not so deeply impressed with their K@@ all@@ an@@ ad@@ ter style , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has filmed a am@@ using documentary on the site and its famous jumping events , along with Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the testimony he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the heart .
&quot; indeed , there is respect to the family &apos;s performance , but also ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump is a bit &apos; la@@ zy &apos; , says L@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the vicinity , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - at high pressure : the do@@ wer , she says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is thus coming from the village of investors .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story started 1885 , when the late grandfather was emigrated , and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers . &quot;
the foundation stone of the real estate company were first land in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to the country , failed by the Bavarian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not hesitate , because he was once spotted with permission , the Director of the Institute for Young History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was proclaimed a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ flow . &quot;
this is in contrast to the partly significant statements of the desc@@ end@@ ment .
he had repeatedly talked to Mexican immigrants in the United States and put on the construction of a border to deter those illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the p@@ added , that is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant wing of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born rab@@ bit , who was Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he &apos;s always so crum@@ bly . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension in Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz family sp@@ ends a visit slightly for the church organ which was generally well @-@ dated . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that with Donald , the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not know the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know whether this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had his grandfather at the time of his grandfather in the United States , would have been like him , &quot; he never had arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ fal@@ si@@ os Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as the president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are ripe , even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els &apos;s film , interviewed for the Tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 kin@@ kers , including in the USA awak@@ ens the interest . &quot;
the upper Bavarian community of Ram@@ s@@ au near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;

&quot; today a slight increase on the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the final Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;

the big novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ enst@@ ar of resi@@ to the ra@@ fting Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a newly de@@ fun@@ ky father , who ent@@ ails to settle down with his two children at the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had wondered if Thom@@ son could solo a hit show by Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor from Seven was strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and beat the block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results of the evening two by The Chase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 - 17.@@ 30 ) of the new quiz show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe , showed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ests Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13,000 ) . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?

&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki are probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly intense who wins the bach@@ elor &apos;s degree . &quot;
&quot; the wife , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , has been filled in terms of sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; none of the three left girls will certainly not give , whether they are the one who received the last Rose . &quot;
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before out of three , you may be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous by a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood has sealed his lips until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women have let themselves out on the ly@@ rical way , why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense for humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as a reason why they want to be their partners . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who gets the last Rose ? &quot; &quot; their answers could be destroyed , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both well - except for himself , Mack@@ ay , as the best partner in Wood . &quot;
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood looked for a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ ah ) and Sam@@ s , I noticed that she felt quite compatible and I thought it was in the entire course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground at both feet , making it so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mar@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I saw her together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their point of view , Mack@@ ay reported that the house of the house last week made her clear that Wood Beyond &quot; must be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this obviously is not just a game - I &apos;m already waiting for him , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when she was asked to choose who Wood might choose , when not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love those who live left equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent their impressive program at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a clever decision .
&quot; some coach would have sent Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank , when he lost a messenger with his first pun@@ t @-@ league with his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula confi@@ ded to his husband , and put Hay@@ ne on the next occasion to a pun@@ t return and also in running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula still showed his true face in the changing booth after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strongly strengthened Hay@@ den in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ journalist , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the Special Team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to catch his for@@ get@@ ed catch and care for the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne &apos;s pat@@ ched with a pun@@ t in the first playing quarter of Minnesota Vik@@ ings
&quot; it wasn &apos;t the start , Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian trade show for his N@@ FL debut had been hoping for . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t see any worse boot in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that &apos;s going on , it takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the shar@@ pen@@ er back in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area has resulted to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
&quot; nevertheless , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; Ai@@ an@@ ger asked for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , just as it did during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; so it doesn &apos;t go further , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
expired asylum seek@@ ers want to push the free voters as rapidly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ an@@ ger asked more personnel for the provision of administrative courts to be responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; &quot; Ai@@ an@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; the FW body critic@@ ised that several German states do not be consistent : &quot; &quot; we need nationwide mixed standards in the German states . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after police shot at protest@@ ers in bl@@ ur@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police were demonstr@@ ating rubber shells to the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu City . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Head of District officers , said that more than 1,000 activists had assembled outside a police station , with some of you cast stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said that the police have been deployed in Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and then shot in the air before she res@@ orted to rubber shells .
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used in rubber , which is known to kill them , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , obviously they produced such a high mortality rate . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ frontation was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as sub @-@ Jewish levels where members of the ethnic group has been saying that new provinces , which are made under the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the arus that would want to have their own State .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent cl@@ ashes since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; as the four great political parties signed an agreement with the country in provinces , a major step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed by hundreds of centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature had agreed to vote on certain claims for this week in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;

Google will start collecting donations in support of $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign that aims to bring out 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations , forcing thousands of refugees to flee by the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
&quot; Google has an un@@ usually personal approach , which is spe@@ ar@@ ising from donations to his blog . &quot;
&quot; instead of leaving a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who fled with her family from Kabul , writes about her personal experience as she was seven years old . &quot;
&quot; the journey belonged to many dark railway and bus lines , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and anxiety , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but because of the refugee and migrants crisis in Europe , many people looking for their families are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , international Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Google said that the first global funds will amount to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / by $ 11 million . &quot;
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many would even escape from war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

&quot; in addition to an overweight diabe@@ tic , weight loss of loss can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss for weight @-@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years after a new study .
&quot; it is too early to say , if lightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who have non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the death of death requires a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert for weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new trial in j@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
weight loss loss or adi@@ pos@@ itas @-@ surgery use several methods to minim@@ ize the size of stomach .
&quot; you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own capability , food . &quot;
&quot; over the years obesity has proved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as efficiently , but most studies have been conducted with people who are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are valid as ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which have been collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach cr@@ ushing and stomach cr@@ ushing - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were slightly exagger@@ ated . &quot;
the average review of those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year .
the BMI of the BMI of the non @-@ surgical implant@@ ation treatments remained at approximately 29 .
&quot; among the ones taken up a surgical procedure , the diabetes mell@@ itus was completely dissolved in 36 % of the diabetes mell@@ itus , and at 28 % partially . &quot;
the medi@@ cally treated group triggered a completely only one percent in comparison with diabetes and partly at only about two percent .
&quot; moreover , results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ de , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol , generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; invented the authors . &quot;
researchers also supervised the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood levels that reflects blood glucose levels over time .
&quot; hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is kept alive at the best below 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control , &quot; as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , according to Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also contra@@ ctu@@ ally performed average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y group ( 18,@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and recorded a complete revers@@ al of the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ coming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study showed no survival benefit from surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was under@@ gone with ob@@ ese people who underwent an obesity intervention , about 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years - compared to a group called conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming down to people with a BMI under 35 that are interested in the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because she says that this operation is lower in this lower BMI group , with an increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think they have accumulated this genetic changes that have accumulated their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ ing really hard . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not contain all refugees , the Dalai Lama added and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East would lie . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders invited people to end violence in the countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the refugee crisis in his 10 @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford , devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that , under the given circumstances , he must face the interests of humanity the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of the West European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; even though the Dalai Lama has praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to conquer the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions as a real peace and real development , mainly through education for these Muslim nations . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we have to reduce the action of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the issue of violence and commented as George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 , and set out that the violent reaction of the US moved to a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , when I put my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , I said to him , the path to solve this problem is in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ fs were good , but he put power a lot , and it anticipated an unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase from taking of sever@@ ity disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; water control centres across the United States will report on an almost 400 @-@ percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swallowed us alcoholic beverages as well as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of disinf@@ ection were reported in children under 12 years , reporting control centers , from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more often more often in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency department , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children make disinf@@ ect@@ ant lu@@ ci@@ ously drinking , while some of them do , to im@@ press her friends , or for a mut@@ ing in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can only drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of cheap experience .
&quot; you@@ ths allegedly resulted in disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ alcohol mou@@ th@@ water , to maintain a tough@@ er drink . &quot;
younger children can be lu@@ red by attractive fragrance of disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ le@@ aded .
&quot; it is disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and or@@ ang@@ du@@ es which are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with infants can result in a few sy@@ ring@@ es for alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ not@@ orious Centre at the University of Kansas City , related to Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , commented Dr. Stephen 4 in S@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t make a drink whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come on it , then it &apos;s a fast way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year old girl who recently taken four sy@@ ring@@ es of after the straw@@ berry , was taken in school , was taken into an emergency shel@@ tered . &quot;
&quot; their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold of those aged by a law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ h@@ ey , an emergency doctor , who treated her in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah laugh@@ ed her words , and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency department . &quot;
doctors later overs@@ aw her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of brain trau@@ ma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and pushed his head over that Rit@@ h@@ ey said .
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ do Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ amin &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
&quot; Lop@@ ez has parents and teachers recommended , non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to use and disinf@@ ection products outside the child &apos;s reach . &quot;
about alcohol pois@@ oning were some disinf@@ ect@@ ant linked with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario called Canada after the swal@@ low of anti @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ clear allocation . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product me@@ thanol contained , a fatal solution instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ kohol , not@@ ated as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were scheduled in the state of New York to forget her &quot; a &quot; teacher &quot; in relation to anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; says a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ disinf@@ ection and banned them from their space .
the police viewed the mis@@ led map as &quot; creature wa@@ it@@ z &quot; and presented the disciplinary action to the agency administration .

&quot; but currently the ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland do they show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they were interested .
there &apos;s a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m Play and there &apos;s not just the people who want to see the games .

now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

why I shall be witness to a execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; today , I will see something like a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
when it happens and I hope it will not happen I &apos;ll be able to sit in a spect@@ ator at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses with his death .
&quot; the invitation was ready for the first time in January over his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; the day closer , I began to fear me . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see journalists in the United States , and there are often more applicants than at their disposal , a ma@@ xi lot@@ tery takes place to decide who will choose . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , that will be observed without moving . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I am sitting next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps eng@@ est friend in which I developed my own relationship with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh often when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can not be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook &amp; pen in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
&quot; a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma acc@@ uses me on Twitter , to give my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I am compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; better shape &quot; , &quot; but she thinks she is wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he does not tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
&quot; I told him , that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time . &quot;
&quot; but he wants , that an international person is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he considers the public relations work towards the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit in front of me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the information of po@@ d@@ casts I have made . &quot;
I won &apos;t want to enter here again for all details .
I can not say in security that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his activities after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would like to make him a fav@@ oured work .
but I believe that a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood exists that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death part .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him die .
I can not claim to be really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn .
&quot; what you will get of me is , what it means to see a man who wants to die unnecessary . &quot;

&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards by Racing Victoria had tried to install a spy on his st@@ ables last year , and threatened to quit the race . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at the Ste@@ ward and the Integration Unit of Racing Victoria and claimed that they led a personal campaign against him with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai , due to a racing day treatment that led to the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , saying that he is always trying to do what is best for racing and he himself found under difficult conditions as it went about the positive Cob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ fer@@ no at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept up for 18 months , due to the es@@ pi@@ on@@ age repro@@ aches and didn &apos;t want it to look like it was too high . &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it , and I did eat for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know there was going on .
&quot; sometimes you have to react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I must live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home today and sleep well .
&quot; I want to go about rising up head , and I want my own@@ ing that I try my best for her . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do it , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
&quot; I have to think , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; before , Moo@@ dy had the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , and the quality department had attempted to sp@@ ell its stable . &quot;
&quot; eight months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart was in a room with a man - whom I will ren@@ ame -- and we offered him an employment in my St@@ ables to provide information about what I am doing within my St@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they seem obvious that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should surely hold on their ni@@ ases , because it ass@@ aul@@ ts me with the attempt to reconc@@ ile me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , the re@@ ig@@ ning president of Route L and Bernard Sa@@ unders , at the current CEO of Route L , were at this time still conscious . &quot;
should this make me feel that it &apos;s personal ?
&quot; has the RV@@ L boast and possibly accounts for people outside of train@@ ers , what is going on in the sector ? &quot;
am I so bad for this industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take me my license and viol@@ ated me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
&quot; I will ex@@ ert pressure on them , and they rush to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the l@@ elling levels of the train@@ ers have been built at Li@@ dar@@ i , with the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching announced that he could put his licence on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by its preparation of the un@@ ned Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race treatment &quot; &quot; ridicul@@ ous &quot; &quot; after one pack mud or sound was rolled out to the horse debut , which pushed the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take over the full responsibility , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees mistak@@ enly did face up on the leg . &quot;
it could have been so night .
&quot; it could have been like yesterday the whole day , which was like this . &quot;
but it was also the same day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack at the same day . a study on this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who apply these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man on driver suits
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested one man after a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver assistance in Cob@@ bs . &quot;
cycl@@ ist was given by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray @-@ Valley Highway from Saturday morning .
&quot; the police said , drivers drove on , stopping to stop the injured rider . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia was found by the police in She@@ p@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged with driver assistance and in@@ let assistance and for other traffic del@@ ik@@ es .
&quot; cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ bs remains in the hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy deals with ri@@ vals to ring claims against ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favour@@ ites at N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said the refer@@ ee was allowed to have the Storm @-@ player &quot; Ring@@ ve &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ ja coach Wayne Bennett did a hard cover to the Storm @-@ Team , after they achieved the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; sample example &quot; from the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland could not be &quot; good &quot; in rings . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his crew , saying that she is only concentr@@ ating on her &quot; contact &quot; upon the tac@@ kling . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coach would be confident of his team , as it means that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; that appears always up - I didn &apos;t hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about Ring@@ ve , when she finished talking to us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive System or techniques across the whole year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es to a real focus , and this has provided the trend opportunities for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not getting used to lose , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it is funny as this up to this season .
Bell@@ amy chan@@ ted the idea of &quot; exciting soccer &quot; and reminds its ment@@ or that Benn@@ ets St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons created the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; sin@@ c@@ ere &quot; football .
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was a boring team , and Wayne told me that he would take care of a she@@ ath thing . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team , and can play it as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play , if you have those kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so that they can play like this . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger trust , because they are saying these things because they are a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when it went around the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roo@@ ster plays an higher income than the game pic@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ x was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the outcome ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are there any breaks and do not have any scored points ?
these are the game boards for me .
&quot; when they are talking about us , it means we will be meeting in one phase . &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales start next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Serbia with 200,000 worth of deposit to drug abuse &quot;
&quot; a man , possibly a li@@ fel@@ ong penalty may fall because of its attempt to get to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine that were mu@@ g@@ gled to Queensland , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , as he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ fel@@ ong penalty for the attempt to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , argu@@ ed the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , argu@@ ing that it was no evidence that he could have been trying to possess the entire amount and that in the Café has been of a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the city of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relationships to Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a case , he lied the police on his position . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ic mother and step@@ father , with a security deposit of 200,000 dollars , had offered a security deposit to reach his event@@ ual release . &quot;
&quot; following reading the aff@@ id@@ able explanations of the two people it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; says Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice , to stop him from being published , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian passport , and in the police open daily and decided to catch a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone from girls to co@@ ax le@@ vel@@ oph@@ ile to sending images
one ped@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year @-@ old girl to demand images of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone in the girl , when she fell asleep , had received an online mess@@ aging services , from which he received a number of un@@ proper pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she looked through it , found the conf@@ using news and al@@ ar@@ ated immediately her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police finally took care of it and saw the five images , analyzed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web @-@ resear@@ ches , that used to search for continuous pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g claims to the public then that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; he gave to be a polic@@ eman to make them frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; state lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson , the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court said , &quot; He said it would be a ad@@ diction , - that he is ad@@ dic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search was done on the computer of him , but he said it was done because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to be sc@@ aff@@ led to P@@ adi@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent his pictures and he asked for sending more photos .
he said he was doing it to attract them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head , when he drinks , and said he would look on the images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and in the weeping . &quot;
it also saw the in@@ consistent pictures on the phone and confron@@ ted the accused .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the accused managed computer and Play@@ station , to speak with girls who saw a lot younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty in the sense of the indictment , to have im@@ permanent pictures of children on 14 June of this year , to have appeared before the court on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; def@@ endant Gregor S@@ im asked for that H@@ og@@ g appears not on the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as they argue that &quot; there is no significant sexual element in his way . &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict of October to receive background reports about social work .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings on other illegal cases . &quot;
he was enrolled in the judgment of sexual offen@@ ders even before the date of judgment .
to@@ vers turn to small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are accessed by the big control points at the Austrian border .
&quot; many locks , made from fear before discovery and close to the people , increased the amount of smaller limits . &quot;
&quot; to the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , the border parts of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have gained access to more than 1,000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; in short , they had to walk through bridges and traffic jams on the German side . &quot;
&quot; there , they are taken out by federal police in Amman and for@@ warded to registration . &quot;
&quot; at the Munich Main Railway Station , in contrast to the weekly start of Wednesday , more refugees arrived in the following year . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 am , a speaker named this morning . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town . &quot;

at Friday the sun leaves around the sun again .
the mass is &apos; s : every two years the Autobahn at the International Motor Show showed their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is primarily moving to the compact cars that are currently selling well . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are especially popular : about 28.@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals accounted for by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone . &quot;
this is also reflected at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation 17 - 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the greatest premier@@ es for the German high@@ ways is the Opel Astra , which will stand by tra@@ ders in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
he belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
the new Astra should also not be much more expensive for the new Astra .
&quot; Opel exhibits an entry under the biggest compet@@ itor VW Golf in a view , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra range from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; furthermore , the H@@ esse also offer more diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the principal competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel &apos;s Astra boasts in first just a five @-@ fifth gasoline engine . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA Motor Show . &quot;
and what &apos;s going on with the Astra at the Frankfurt Motor Show more than new comp@@ actor ?
Renault Met@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra Compet@@ ent Mé@@ ri@@ e to the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ ri@@ e is exclusively available in a conventional and a stressed sports GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in business , he comes next year , then as Kom@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : quite new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ branch wants to find the new model in the rapidly growing segment .
this compact Infin@@ iti fits all into the design line of the brand .
the basic model will have a petrol engine with at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer is also available in diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is the world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is the maximum torque of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno park in Europe is spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not quite new , but it is completely renewed , and the compact car model DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble German Citroën built most of everything at the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was newly painted and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology has been fitted . &quot;
&quot; the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was updated above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ ry for the first time . &quot;
&quot; at the International Motor Show , in addition , a series of over@@ working and new variants mean the newly @-@ looked Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meter cell are human beings
the Federal Constitutional Court has ordered a ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the Justice of Justice of Te@@ gel who had been accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
&quot; in principle , due to the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation when they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision made the Federal Constitutional Court issued a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; those affected can even hope for the judges , even if they were only few days in confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
this was a ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with some five square meters of soil area between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not completely separate .
&quot; afterwards , the man who has moved back to a larger cell once again after his An@@ wal@@ let . &quot;
his office cler@@ al will fail because of the in@@ justice conditions against the country in Berlin .
but the Constitutional Court rec@@ eded the judgment of the Chamber of Chamber of Berlin and returned the case to re @-@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s lives injured .
chamber decision now decide on the amount of compensation
&quot; for legal reasons , although for judicial reasons , only a few days of detention for the compensation had to be author@@ itative , there was an exc@@ ision to say . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; must respect the legal protection of the personality . &quot; &quot;
the chamber is now to clear the amount of money damage .
the constitu@@ tionally in the past have strengthened the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
&quot; thus in April , they said to a prisoner for damages , because he was imprisoned in a prison cell . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is a decision of 2011 the multi @-@ occup@@ anc@@ ell@@ ation of a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; on Wednesday , in addition , Karlsruhe , also confirmed the Constitutional Court on Wednesday , that a prisoner had agreed to deliver a decent accommodation in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs took place between 15 and 21 hours a day in a similar cell and at the Karlsruhe company in Karlsruhe .
the Berlin pris@@ ons were made headlines in the headlines in recent weeks .
&quot; prisoner there will therefore always be 23 hours including the aggressi@@ veness , even in beats , it should happen because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the judicial authorities , 21 spots in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young athletes , they shall take away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are making it &quot;
migration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the testimony from Vice @-@ Chancellor , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) ; Germany is even able to include a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated in view of the unusual challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot;
&quot; what comes across Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; after a different progn@@ oses , it is needed to generate between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ating the federal state of ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ating the Pest@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments every year , namely the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but especially in affordable rental properties : 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments come out from ten@@ ants &quot; housing each year , and in order to apply these particularly favourable homes , refugees are also involved . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , aims to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; a lot too little is the point of view from the pest@@ el @-@ Institut : 80 000 social apartments per year , would have to occur and would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion each year . &quot;
scientists and federal law look forward to that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research and Occup@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of the poultry industry can be employed in Germany in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not have been asked in order to help them in order to help them get started , including Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
but refugees are crucial for the integration of refugees .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the appreciation of the admission group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ash , a political transition has been given : the ban for refugees to recognise jobs . &quot;
&quot; while there was previously a ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the resi@@ den@@ ation of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society , a majority of visibility has been passed in society - in order to enable refugees to grow faster from access to the labour market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are lack of German .
&quot; so far , there is no exception of an adequate supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; also , studies show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the construction of networks is therefore the Königs@@ berg &apos;s view of integration . &quot;
&quot; Berlin School of Berlin has established that only a few fle@@ dged parents give their children to day@@ cares , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only really important to collabor@@ ate the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ y , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , to convince the family of the benefits of the K@@ ita , the administration of hand@@ pieces is distributed in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if required , the need for educ@@ ators would increase heavily by the great number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase its training capacity - by raising more technical schools . &quot;
students without German knowledge of welcome groups are set up in the following countries .
&quot; they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also taught teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there was no lack , says Be@@ ate Swe@@ ar from the Berlin School of school@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk , Germany estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in principle , there is no subject of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ali@@ ens . studies - the only exception was previously Berlin , Internal Affairs , Frank ( CDU ) has now given its attitude . &quot;
Studi@@ ous refugees could make the access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a permit or for@@ age , no benefits after the asylum seek@@ ers are receiving more if they begin to study their courses . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter is not sub@@ ju@@ ction , since they are not falling below the number of supp@@ or@@ ating persons . &quot;
&quot; Ged@@ ul@@ ators had to be spent four years in Germany so far , to be entitled to B@@ Af@@ and@@ G @-@ entitled to be reduced from 1st January 2016 to 15 months from 1 January 2016 . &quot;
&quot; but this funding gap must also be closed but Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the Deutscher Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ ck@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a key role in the future , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many more is the religion an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually intensi@@ fy the same rights as they have the churches , and to further develop the existing state @-@ churches @-@ law on a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to have the establishment of a Islamic welfare of the Association professionally engaged in the new@@ com@@ ers .
the rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representative of the Islam must be on clear contact for some and willing to collabor@@ ate with the state in many areas and to give him certain control options . &quot;
&quot; to this end , will@@ ingness to take heed to religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern for the concern , religious conflicts could also be applied in Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to g@@ ust these conflicts in Germany would immediately claim their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more than today a subject of society .
&quot; thus , the majority of the majority society will change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Germany has , though , as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination Act and an General Gender Equality Act . &quot;
&quot; but it is getting very slowly , as the NSU @-@ painting show showed , the police and authorities systematically igno@@ res the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and interests of non @-@ white German demand for long demand and for what international agreement will under@@ take effect in the next few years , if the country should remain peaceful and use its new citizens to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medical assistance to previously expected refugees , the doctors @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this , &quot; said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , extra money needed to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery calls to all the new@@ com@@ ers to the register of heal@@ ings . &quot;
the services could be withdrawn later by the federal states .
and long term it is highly question@@ able to contain so many people with the limited circuit rights that see the asylum seek@@ ers .
otherwise doctors make medical care of taking the language barrier .
&quot; the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has already proved , thus , migrants are worse and perceived their disease than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in hospitals , also in medical practices , pre@@ ting expenses would have to be taken over . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees have already been helped with more general medical services in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic glance .
&quot; in the refugee camps approximately , there are much more untreated disabilities , and in the young people it goes around HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Mont@@ gom@@ ery was clearly told by the other important issues of the disease , but Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite incident or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; and as regards the doctors , he may actually get lost in sight because of the refugees . &quot;
the Syrians have developed a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; to be able to practice , they would have to reject and possibly rec@@ l@@ ur@@ red their quali@@ fications . &quot;
half of the refugees arriving in Germany is psych@@ ologically in Germany ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) psych@@ ically ill : most of them suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder or depression .
&quot; the sons of Refu@@ ge@@ es , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are especially vulnerable . &quot;
&quot; a recent study , published by TU Munich , shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany . &quot;
&quot; anyone who suffers from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disease is suffering from the flash problems with breathing , dizziness , pac@@ ing and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , severe frigh@@ tening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms considered to be chronic , early @-@ term treatment , Mun@@ z declared . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; while the treatment of psych@@ ic asylum seek@@ ers can pose an application for psych@@ otherapy , however , treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , social workers or doctors , who are not educated in mental illness , would not decide if any therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mal@@ h@@ estim@@ ations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
the new &quot; passion &quot; refers to the cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst in the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
&quot; the aim is to draw all age group in the sp@@ ell of amazing acro@@ b@@ atics , animal dres@@ sings and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst charges in the cir@@ cus on the brick kil@@ n as dre@@ aming to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine how to live my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior youth . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current man@@ oeu@@ vre .
already for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so the gift for am@@ aze with the family is the blood .
&quot; it is important to take the people away from their daily ri@@ ott and take it for two hours to another world , &quot; st@@ resses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior game . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ne@@ ther with world city fl@@ air , &quot; thus director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities at the barely 3 000 km tour , this fl@@ air can now be experienced . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family put the audience with a joke and charm . &quot;
also the Castillo came up with their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the dum@@ my films , the Cuban duo wants to loose the Cuban duo . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - identify with these words they identify themselves .

&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
griev@@ ances in the position of cir@@ cu@@ it@@ ry are only exc@@ used in different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also believes , &quot; Is not this good for our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy a matches .
&quot; according to the possibility of every wish , the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; as they have been lov@@ ingly called . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it will not even be in the ring . &quot;
so the first commandment is : ensure good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid , a mixture of a shell pon@@ y@@ h@@ anger and a zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ ine , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two monkeys have lived for eight years in a stap@@ le and nothing happened .

there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether there are five or a 200 spectators , we always give our best and be with a whole heart . &quot;
the cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst charges from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 20 pm to his performances .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the daily show is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe : Robert Mu@@ gabe gives false speech in the Parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , the oldest leader in Africa , fell down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly throughout social media . &quot;
&quot; the Parliament &apos;s inauguration was also clou@@ ded by the members of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them against Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; during the last month , they had scattered him , and interrupted his talk about the State of the Nation in Parliament , and this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent gon@@ ese said that seven opponents of the politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they previously war@@ ted Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ an address .
&quot; the message comes from a number that will not appear , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists by Mu@@ ch &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; all of the members of Parliament warns that the immun@@ ity will end in Parliament , and once they left the Parliament , their parliamentary immun@@ ity will no longer be effective . &quot;
the chief speaker MEP said that by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of the politicians .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the context of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and its service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected level of commitment to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , HP announced in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these re@@ structure measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ President and Chief Executive , who should lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise becomes smaller and more focused than it today , and we have a broad and promising portfolio of businesses that support businesses to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better established than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has invested more than $ 50 billion and is focused on providing un@@ att@@ ain@@ able , integrated technology solutions to businesses , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
it is divided into a company that was set up in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard . the Palo Alto garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring process to tackle the turn of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the biggest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area , based on the conviction that the focused company is bringing a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb has to be behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; in summary , to Wil@@ sh@@ ere also stressed that there is only one reason for his rehabilitation after planning , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is secure at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history its participation in the next summer will be uncertain at the European Championship . &quot;
&quot; the great dis@@ grace regarding this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the final season after a separate ank@@ le injury , and then returned to its old swing in the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bones that healed not well .
this is no greater matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his Kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , or with the injuries which he had before . &quot;
&quot; it may be true from pure medical point of mind , but as W@@ enger also recognized , there is the corresponding danger of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it develops a pleasant pattern .
the Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different illnesses by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in just 65 of Arsen@@ als to 157 lig@@ ations in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two premi@@ er league clubs were to list the most vulnerable periods . &quot;
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a Teu@@ fel@@ ong circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the rate of injury during the last season is supposed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a temporary space , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle force , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will run a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and W@@ enger introduces a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; tro@@ users Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta is supposed to start . &quot;
W@@ enger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and give the players who require it to indul@@ ge in a little delay , &quot; &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear , through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the courts with the biggest ti@@ mid@@ day effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has started in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , whereby it was measured on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that Arsenal had moved the doctrine from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and has been ab@@ orted by far hope , with his management to lead the club to his first European cup of European triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it has never worked out for arsen@@ al .
&quot; we stayed in 2006 very close to it , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendship celebration : the com@@ edy show giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friends
&quot; the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is evident , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up , now even doub@@ ted than ever , as self @-@ mor@@ dr@@ ate among young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death case with men ranging from 20 to 45 in Great Britain and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ de ( CA@@ LM ) announced the Camp@@ aign for a very bad life of 2015 than the year of the man with the aim of helping people seek to seek help when they need these . &quot;
friendship is the heart of heart in order to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with de@@ pressed symp@@ tom thought that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances for recovery is doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of intellec@@ tu@@ ally healthy friends inter@@ ven@@ es the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one must first have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communication , with its focus on substance over substance , is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; digital life have done the need to be strong , li@@ fel@@ i@@ ded and successfully , even if in reality domin@@ ating the isolation . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by the domin@@ ating what psych@@ ologist le@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values call ; money , image , social status , everything at costs of in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affects our spiritual health much more profound . &quot;
and like a video play @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire noticeable that money can really not buy .
the great one of friends was that these focus was on his head .
&quot; its personality is defined not through its work , but by its personality who was sh@@ ined through the interaction as friend . &quot;
&quot; hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , Mom@@ ents at the football club in cozy arm@@ chairs and the lon@@ ging for Ross and Rachel - all this came from knowing that men should definitely return to explore fully their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a employee of the phone number provision@@ ing felt telling me : ... &quot; my listening roll for people who are de@@ pressed to depres@@ sive and self @-@ anim@@ ate , has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; men who contact us feel often not able to talk to friends , often . &quot;
&quot; the old familiar phrase &quot; I come with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if one talks about troubles . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows , which comes to me in mind when I try to offer long @-@ term effects . &quot;
it clearly shows the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective outside the out@@ si@@ der status via the phone can help people in sight of desp@@ air , too , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship Fest that celebrate the day completely re@@ organised back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to drink at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; make a smile , or even better , if you see sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what to make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria met Maria to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush the Mal@@ es
angel Di Mary celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh after his hit for Malmö .
Maria i met in his debut at the Champions League at Tuesday and helping PS@@ G to pass by Malmö .
here are the game Report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Mary and Edinburgh , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain held the Champions League season with a very comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Royal park stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; di Maria arrived less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League &apos;s debut as PS@@ G players , who set the French Master on their way , but afterwards pushed one a number of opportunities , before they finally increased their head when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; in terms of Real Madrid and Sch@@ in@@ j@@ or Don@@ esz@@ k in the A group , Paris also requires a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they did not only stri@@ ve the qualification for the final quarter final in each of the past three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ ko Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ic &apos;s chances in front of the gate . he later became aware of his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win back home or back@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents to cause and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we have won , although I am sorry we did not have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; according to his injury in any of three changes to the Paris team , the Lun@@ am@@ mo@@ vic returned to the Paris team at the weekend , a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on own place against Bordeaux , but it was em@@ itted by Di Mary in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian fl@@ atter@@ mer was called as the husband to take the PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , when he finished in the last month by Manchester United - and he interpreted as Johan Wil@@ due , and finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; though anyone believed that PS@@ G would be a big victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic voyage held in a play @-@ off , went to the field at An@@ pi@@ ff , with nine national players on the field and was a heavy enemy with a five @-@ man defense and two deep opponents in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot from Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pp P@@ fo@@ sts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered a little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G even turned to , with some mis@@ guns and bad inclu@@ sions , not least of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was in the first half exhausted and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ launch . &quot;
&quot; despite this , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his te@@ amm@@ ate into the game , and there was a pass by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , whom Di Mary was transformed into a sub@@ sid@@ y , which was hanged by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute . &quot;
&quot; the second gate was finally fell short after the hours mark , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans therefore achieved its sixth qualifying time after the du@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this did not end the thoughts that Malmö able to return into the game , and only an excellent ri@@ pen from Wil@@ by from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , before substitute E@@ zi@@ qu@@ iel Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave it later that PS@@ G was a class over his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then we have played only in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
watch from Paris !
it was a great game of them !

world and European Champion X@@ avi plays since Summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; just a few years ago , the FC Bayern appeared before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played for the FC Barcelona at that time . &quot;

&quot; and the registered show also , Bayern . &quot;
X@@ avi : &quot; there was a choice of Bavaria .
&quot; Rum@@ s@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me , &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in movie film@@ making !
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ted the af@@ ro@@ american filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown while a discussion on the diversity , said she would not need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown while this was the need of alternative perspectives , in terms of a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen scenario of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do the film &apos;s occupation and not at the opening of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted , with the sworn un@@ belief and called &apos; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , when the comments from the actor of The Mar@@ tian abandoned . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown completed the decision @-@ lying Ben Aff@@ ir@@ ck and the Far@@ ut Bre@@ thren , to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to think people to think about it - whoever will be the director of the harmony - as they handle the character of the harmony , &quot; Brown replied . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a Nut@@ shell , beaten by her white im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , for the fin@@ alists , Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o , set him for the film , Dam@@ on answered that their direction &quot; will give something to us what we could not want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , social media explo@@ ded against Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter followers Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip as he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the space , so it can explain its diversity - that is SO W@@ W that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; Twe@@ et served more than 5.000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 que@@ ens since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments come at a time to represent the exact political representation in the media at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager , Michael Brown , in 2014 , had been killed by a white polic@@ emen , the Black Li@@ ves movement recorded a country @-@ wide effect and pressed leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ ating practices against far@@ my@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince came to a Grammy Awards during the introduction of the nominated records of the year . &quot;
&quot; to be silent album , ( albums still have their meaning ) . &quot;

&apos; American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sports clim@@ bs and the operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and took home the big prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the contest @-@ show , which completed her 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant , who was able to complete all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal course , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the final . &quot;
to the last task the climbing of a climbing line reaches a climbing of 75 ft long clim@@ bers in 30 seconds .
&quot; British finished the task within the time , with which it was the first athl@@ ete , who finished the exhau@@ sting stage 4 of American Ninja Warrior . but did Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge more than three seconds qu@@ icker , which made him a winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard fought game , still under shock over the winning of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned it than $ 10,000 or have spent a lifetime , &quot; &quot; Isaac E said ! about his he@@ ap . &quot;
as very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Rep@@ orters to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all at all , just won &apos;t win any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money is the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it &apos;s the one with the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and life changed , he receives the great gramm@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he swe@@ pt over it .
he just has done so happy to have what he did .
he was presented by fans from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his sons and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off was saying to me : &quot; if I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have just felt as if they had changed their roles .
America Ninja Warrior was extended for a half season ; the shooting will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers swe@@ pt away in Minnesota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ WS L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
previously they once were one of the best teams in the bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers are on the last square in the American League Central .
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but this part played a perfect match against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field . &quot;
T@@ wins &apos;s T@@ wins an opportunity to climb up in a game half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories go fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager into Brad . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon kept his early offensive support , who scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in 1 / 3 inside and three things enabled .
it was only his third successful start to his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw in the bull@@ do@@ zers each game , and therefore I want to concentrate entirely into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tig@@ ers @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had hit three matches , and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game in Mart@@ ine@@ z when he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on 6 July .
&quot; he sw@@ ung the bu@@ zz@@ ard well , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good on ( punch training ) , saw clearly better in the bull@@ do@@ zers , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three R@@ uns in the back of the seventh interior the T@@ wins had its best chance to come back into the game .
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks achieved a colorful , and Simon raised his second base , Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ zer lam@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was running a brick wall , the only man who was faced with the designated Rook@@ ie ri@@ ck@@ man Miguel S@@ ano , who is wearing a two @-@ run button on the right @-@ handed ro@@ w . &quot;
&quot; with a couple from L@@ äu@@ ge and the end @-@ run , in the second hand , Ver@@ h@@ agen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ling to a double lock . &quot;
it was the 27th of the 27th in the major league in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ling crashed .
after Detroit at the end of the ninth Inn@@ ings a Insurance Company hit the wall made an R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Sha@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 .
&quot; but the Shel@@ ter , however , sp@@ it three Pit@@ ches for his fifth ring . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game by an yet moving Phil Hughes .
&quot; the tig@@ ers generated three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled prior to the game of the injury list after spending more than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;d be desired , &quot; said Mr Hughes , &quot; &quot; but I felt so better when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after having received the lead against the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ 1 released a single second to Second @-@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z shot to the game which made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z complet@@ es his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third b@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third place as he did the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid out in the second , they achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one two @-@ out single of center F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not sm@@ itten so well , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hughes was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , and scored no points in the third inning , before being replaced by the A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ctor . &quot;
&quot; at Hughes , three ranks were made with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal Sán@@ chez was cancelled due to violation of the root ap@@ ologi@@ ans .
&quot; he was studied by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the Sanchez de Sanchez company in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; since mid @-@ August on the level of injuries , world @-@ list is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with Sanchez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is cancelled by the shock of injuries to start T@@ wins . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ ris starting with 1 @-@ 1 with four tig@@ ers , since then he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July . &quot;
he moved from August 20 because of a confusion in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will stop their series of three games in the Target @-@ Field mission on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is used against Minnesota &apos;s R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 ; 4.@@ 73 ) .
hundreds of refugees continue to attend in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the inhabitants , which were enriched in them , are to be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the City of Wiesbaden was on Tuesday . &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria - an option
&quot; the leader of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think that the definite re@@ issue of military options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he rejected the European states &quot; collective transport . &quot;
four years ago one was glad that the cup has passed by a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict broke out in front of our door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington called on a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Foreign Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station , and no one was sent back to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; also , Germany sent back no refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , this has been agreed so , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , which could include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day following Germany , Mik@@ l &apos;s Leit@@ ner said : there have already been discussion between the general director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
they were not called in concrete figures on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees came across the so @-@ called Bal@@ aton route from Hungary to Austria .
their target is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian collector Werner Fay@@ mann requested an extradition request with several other EU leaders and government summit a special summit for the next week .
Germany had begun with temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have not yet joined a joint operation in the crisis so far .
the EU interior ministers will join a new start on upcoming Tuesday ( 22 September ) to bring a new start to the distribution of more than 120 000 refugees .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the first @-@ channel and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the covenant is shared with the countries in cooperation with the countries , Merkel announced on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister of the German Chancell@@ ery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined the fra@@ gment , those people who need protection , protect them . &quot;
but those who have no lead @-@ perspective could not stay in Germany either .
this decision was shared in the turn of the round .
the Chancellor emphas@@ ized that the state as a whole has to face an &quot; huge exhau@@ sting &quot; movement .
thousands of desper@@ ate refugees have already stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border to Serbia on Tuesday .
&quot; just a few hours after that the government announced in Budapest , the border with Romania firmly planted with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is unlike Serbia for the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent the tu@@ g@@ ating routes over Romania , Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new bor@@ der@@ line . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , on account of e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands more migrants are reported to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
among the ther@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of the Satur@@ n@@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ app@@ r is a global ocean .
these include researchers from observations of the &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; programme .
&quot; accordingly , the moon is easily accessed by the ring around the ring . &quot;
&quot; although this diving movement may be small , but nevertheless too big for an all @-@ strong ascension , it is said in a communication of the Corn@@ ell university in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers have published their analyses in the specialist lecture &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
the longer time was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cap of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid .
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es at the south @-@ pole of Satur@@ n@@ monds , which blo@@ ws the water vap@@ or and iron particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the Astr@@ onom@@ en then closed . &quot;
the extent of the hidden ocean was not clari@@ fied .

&quot; an investigation has viol@@ ated an adoption family injury during the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , divided the association . &quot;
Ram@@ ah had already lam@@ ented over pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the lions , the diagnosis is due to take another four weeks break . &quot;
&quot; that meets us hard , Rama is a her@@ ring loss . &quot;
&quot; we , of course , we need to think about , &quot; said Sports department Nec@@ at Ay@@ ben@@ a in the &quot; Photo &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a passionate professionals . &quot;
&quot; the sixth , however , presented a def@@ ensive bu@@ cks at first as training g@@ ast . &quot;

no diet fruit - man@@ os contain a lot of sugar
Mang@@ os are exotic and mo@@ ist @-@ sweet .
&quot; but whoever wants to pay attention to his sl@@ ender line , often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged from them . &quot;
these Mang@@ os are relatively much sug@@ ars - mainly suc@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruit is still healthy : in them B vitamins , vitamins E and C. B and C also contain a lot of vitamin A and its pre @-@ level beta car@@ ot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; if you eat the fruits , the immune system , the immune system , and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
when you purchase man@@ os should not be too soft or too fixed .
&quot; the form@@ work @-@ color alone says nothing about it , like ripe fruit is - so also green Mang@@ os can taste delicious also . &quot;
&quot; at room temperature , they should be consumed within a few days . &quot;
&quot; then they taste , of course , pure or in sweet food . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go also gives a special touch . &quot;
it mil@@ der the lightly bitter tastes of soft leaf@@ lets such as Chic@@ o@@ cio and et@@ c@@ cio .
&quot; a Mang@@ och@@ ut@@ ney is fine with fish , poultry , lamb and wild animals . &quot;
&quot; the US package service UPS creates up to 9,@@ 5000 outs for Christmas sales in the USA . &quot;
&quot; by the recru@@ itment of seasonal workers , the company was already announced by UPS on Tuesday . &quot;

on Wednesday night and on Thursday bl@@ aze some f@@ ohn with stor@@ my power through the gro@@ cer .
&quot; after cat@@ ching on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front that brings strong rainfall , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature difference . &quot;
&quot; like Met@@ e@@ o@@ News in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive underground park over the British Islands in a powerful south @-@ west stream . &quot;
on the night@@ mar@@ ching page it breaks down to the valleys in the night .
&quot; as a result , hair @-@ dryer until morning @-@ morning falls in the gro@@ oming valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ i area partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
the hair @-@ dryer can penet@@ rate up to the adjacent centre stage and on the mountains are even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h .
&quot; while on Wednesday stor@@ my hair broke down to summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity also starts to beat on the edge of the Alpine slope . &quot;
here the rain is ra@@ ining until Thursday night .
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , with partial over 100 liters of rain per square meter , it is expected to have large quantities of rain in the last days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the f@@ öhn stops the air , in the episode a cold @-@ front with thick , partly we@@ ath@@ ed rain from West to east across Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind goes heavily up to stor@@ my up , and the temperatures are clearly back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are represented in the northern autumn with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it becomes sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; nearly 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously known site in the park on the Opp@@ io River was christen@@ ed on the name of the German re@@ constru@@ ctor . &quot;
&quot; in Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ ans of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the middle of Rome , the park stands next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um . &quot;
the name was called by the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live on their faith as a minority . &quot;
&quot; with the square , it is also visible in a symbolic way that the tradition of the Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k to take the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he encouraged the town back then a welcome sin .
&quot; according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions will be encouraged in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther was then directed by his thes@@ es against the partition of the western Church .
hammer Fantasy : three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dorn@@ enk@@ rone is one of the principal pieces made by Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated its introduction and bi@@ ble texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid paintings . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , which gave the entire personal interpretation of Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas in 150 different moti@@ fs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received - but by no means in@@ significant with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective subjects . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project , which he made a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many subject areas of &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the origins are made up of cycles such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or pat@@ ern@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he spontan@@ e@@ ously fascin@@ ated several partners : this is true of the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as to the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is primarily the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who placed themselves on the basis of painting with the particular scripture . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible interpre@@ ts by Ot@@ mar Alt , and thus into current connections . &quot;
these lyrics are like verb@@ al mirrors from Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; once embedded them , they are between the original Bible University of Martin Luther and a proposition of the artist who conver@@ ts his very personal thoughts on the appropriate situation here . &quot;
the jewelry cord has a rock climbing .
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old does not allow twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; ultimately , his objec@@ tion to the Bible project was born at all : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and born in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict prot@@ agonist Spirit . &quot;
&quot; since the education had come with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt reminds himself . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up , try to ad@@ mis@@ carry me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help bring art in real time again : &quot; &quot; perception of pictures today is influenced by advertising today , and that is noisy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is given up there .
artists have a different desire and desire to show things .
pictures always have some mysterious and are not decor@@ atively .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt , who wants to make the viewer in the pictures &quot; &quot; seem to be inv@@ alu@@ able , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung , already &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; &quot; I like to compreh@@ end with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I have not tried the Bible completely to capture the Bible , but those important for him as well as mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; this was no co @-@ operation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here goes around the images , the text could be explained only . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler from Luther @-@ Verlag to locate his invitation , &quot; its life to deep@@ en and freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts images talk about the fittings of both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time at an exhibition published by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th .
building start for BM@@ X track
&quot; plans were made , found place , businesses locate the earth @-@ as@@ par@@ agus for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was done - yet again before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was at the end . &quot;
&quot; par@@ tak@@ ers in politics and administration looked for land@@ marks , especially with the residents who would not toler@@ ate the train . &quot;
&quot; so you are looking down hills , new space - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the permission to go down in October , the first municipal worker , Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock , was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year had to be seen , &quot; she said . &quot;
then we should start the work with the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied its commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its involvement for refugees from 2019 to 2019 , the Bundesliga pre@@ places a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football is respon@@ ding to a te@@ aring situation in Germany and secu@@ res the policy helped by managing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this was the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that goes nothing , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be interested in getting this topic in the handle , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23 , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany inten@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chancell@@ ery and meet there the State Minister &apos;s Minister E@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the subject will play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football is up and wants to help .
the key turn@@ around has to set up politics .
&quot; therefore , the German soccer League has extended its refugees &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Brown Foundation , that this programme runs through 2019 , &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach stated on the ver@@ ge of the UEFA Conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal agencies support this programme .
&quot; this weekend , 36 Pro@@ fi@@ del@@ is set a clear sign if they take place on the left tri@@ cot Car@@ ni@@ vals , instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ bing protection ( Hermes ) . &quot; we will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make clear that everyone should help , where and how they can only , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , sport@@ chief Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler and the &quot; Photo &quot; newspaper &quot; &quot; ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ critical . &quot; &quot;
&quot; acqu@@ iring refugee drama every day , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football leaders , no , we must use our jet power to have our influence and possibilities in order to help out the many refugees that have already so incredibly diversi@@ fied , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ hei@@ ms managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot;
&quot; for the Euro 2016 quali@@ fier to Hungary on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach reported the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license agreements have already begun in their own projects , be magnificent . &quot;
&quot; it is just as magnificent , that small and smallest societies are active there . &quot;
&quot; message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; that we have issued will be living in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government , the federation will provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have already called for the whole of 2015 , &quot; Dis@@ covered Kid@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the supervisory board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; says Pl@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was able to participate in the meeting and was &quot; full of work . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; South German newspaper &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and run on to the software corporation . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I understood all the time in regular contact with the supervisory board and whose chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; usually , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to go public with such a personal history of the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everybody can pass something like that . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , when you fall down . &quot;

at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes have made their com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group combined in the Europe League final .
the nation@@ alist is missing the championship leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 @-@ 19.00 / Sky ) .

&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga match in the Bundesliga match of Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach made it open : &quot; we expect a return from it to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of its high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its ancest@@ ry position only at the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change to the door@@ ke@@ el .

robot@@ ic cars : government wants a pioneering role in Germany
Germany is expected to be a technological pioneer by the will of the German government .
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the house of transport ministers Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which sees investments in the port of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Auto Show , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobile age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated and net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and provide for less stress , Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterpart from the G7 countries , also coming together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the transport programme , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of the mobile broadband internet expansion and rapid increase in digital radio stations . &quot;
&quot; at the time of testing new technology , tests are currently going on motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; so that the driver of &quot; no additional health risks are being born , &quot; the Federal Government wants to verify the legal framework and , &quot; where necessary to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
&quot; Germany intends to continue to use internationally , that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars will be raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Federal Government will also apply to a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far can only fore@@ see humans as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car takes over leadership , drivers will increase more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , cap@@ turing the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Finance , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; still , driving vehicles are expected to be expected in public roads towards the end of 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added in the area of driver assistance systems , and the highly automated driving functions at location Germany estimate the authors of the study to around 8.4 billion euros by 2025 . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ rage . &quot;
the issue of liability in case of failure and safety of the personal data of the driver must be un@@ clari@@ fied .
but still the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a on Wednesday at the AA report of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ator DE@@ K@@ RA , however , comes to the result that only eight percent of the Germans think that autonomous driving cars will follow in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 , with autonomous driving cars , were 33 percent in the USA . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the drivers in Germany are not ready to leave themselves completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the digital network of Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would vote , which should be controlled during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that could be seen at no less than 15 percent in the current traffic , at St@@ au below 45 percent . &quot;
a good Every@@ one would leave the car to control under no circumstances .

Gaul@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant .
it is a mixture of quite large run@@ way and a wax figures scene : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : sho@@ en@@ ins ne@@ qu@@ ins , that sho@@ vels most beautiful thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer who , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits , became the great star of fashion scene - so that he put men in skirts . &quot;
I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant at Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have a white hair .
&quot; it used to be quite easy , since it &apos;s real , &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is shown from 18 September to the Kuns@@ thalle of the Hyp@@ o culture foundation , it is a good fortune that the fashion designers has changed its originally refused attitude to a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he actually had been a little to say , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; he sounded like a sort of death for me , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection was previously made in Montreal , Montreal and Paris . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the Director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly an enormous work of the man who has written in history without ever having an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall production , used for the much effort to m@@ ise the d@@ olls , an example of st@@ yl@@ ist was hired for example . &quot;
&quot; according to the figures published by the curator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , according to Munich , the makers have wr@@ inkl@@ ed 14 tons of material . &quot;
&quot; just before the start of the October Festival , there was a special scarf : a leather tro@@ users out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old Teddy is in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ re fashionable hi@@ ring of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student , not bad in football ) , he took his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
he t@@ oss this fashion afterwards himself .
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich told . &quot;
&quot; later on , I bought them then . &quot;
for his first fashion show he did not pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry for s@@ ard@@ ines - Sp@@ acious tip as a fashion @-@ ni@@ an
&quot; earlier the long stick@@ ers worked together in and around pl@@ ush so , metres to make . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered substances and tips were made in large amounts for customers , for example , to wear ceilings and gar@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Rec@@ eiver Pl@@ auen . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; at the beginning times of Pl@@ au@@ ener Sp@@ itz , fashion played a greater part , then was pushed through the home textile industry - and is now discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt is called some examples : lace in jewelry , when accessories such as bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which re@@ jects itself on the history of styles , an increasing contract potential . &quot;
those who are not operated in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
they already make up half of all the jobs in us .
crew cabine is composed together with nine other companies member in the industry association of pl@@ au@@ ener and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
over the last 15 years around 80 percent of sales have been broken .
&quot; private specialty stores , and wholesale , are almost no longer available . &quot;
our products hardly reach customers in this way .
&quot; today , the mass commodity today become much cheaper in the Asian region , and is almost exclusively sold through chains . &quot;
&quot; also fe@@ eb@@ le of export , currently based on Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness like C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Em@@ press in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year , we have been producing a quality label , which shows that we produce eco @-@ ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; graduate in Economics , U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Institute of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alizes in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips . &quot;
&quot; to show the competition from the Asian region , you have to find quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and enterprises , which must think of all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design will vary only slightly to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , Kat@@ i Re@@ uter designed the historic snow le@@ verage brand . &quot;
the machine suff@@ oc@@ ates to some places little ch@@ icks .
&quot; the pl@@ au@@ ded gold @-@ smith &quot; &quot; H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ches &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; I could not start with traditional pupp@@ y tip . &quot;
now they use the snow le@@ ath@@ es for their jewellery .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the topic of pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; they also supplies in the USA , Australia , and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in pl@@ ush and surroundings , and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
in this I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador of Pl@@ au@@ ener .

&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re@@ mission but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays 20 years after the first film with the magic child ma@@ ids . &quot;
it is about the experience of the N@@ anny family &apos;s experience in the days of the Great Depression in England .

XI is committed to open the economy th@@ icker for the world
&quot; the economy must open broad@@ ly to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned to the Reform &apos;s steering . &quot;
&quot; China should under@@ attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies of business improvements , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; new start @-@ ups to promote and promote reforms , will place new moment@@ um and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said . &quot;
&quot; guide Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , Rel@@ ax@@ ation of border controls policy , promoting private capital ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of residents . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list has been identified , sectors and businesses that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested and tested by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance since it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , which is ensured and the open marketplace , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also over@@ take controls on the companies that are transferred to the companies and make sure companies will decide how to run their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economies and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the scope of an offer to open governmental sectors , additional areas will be open to private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legal interests of foreign @-@ financed firms and make better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; guarantee , facil@@ it@@ ating the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; the right to guarantee their lawyers to exercise their activities , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double the mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ors
&quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit for mercury in large car@@ gos and to take consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a valid working draft for the EU , critic@@ ised the plans &apos; risks and effects of mis@@ guided missiles and environmental policy , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , we shall increase the limits of a nervous system for major fish at the end of the food chain as for example shar@@ ks or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from one of two milli@@ grams of mercury kg per kilogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large car@@ ni@@ fish are still so heavily bur@@ dened by mercury today , that on the basis of the valid limit values , about 50 per cent of the length must not be sold . &quot;
&quot; according to dou@@ bling the limit values , only a 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available . &quot;
&quot; in turn , according to F@@ ood@@ watch the EU wants to stum@@ ble the limit values with other fishes from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 gram of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because little cemetery @-@ fish , such as car@@ p mostly bur@@ dened as low , that they keep their planned limits already . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of le@@ an@@ ism is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de of di@@ ver , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal case rich in humans . this is enriched over the food chain mainly in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; no small amounts may cause damage to the nervous system damage caused by the nervous system damage .
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Justice says on his website , with respect to the applicable maximum values , that a &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; shall not be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by coal combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written report from the Federal Ministry of the German Federal Ministry to the Green Party , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ ania deliver more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of which issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; mercury concentration in the El@@ be , Rhine and Danube are &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted in March of the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , the European war@@ nings of mercury in fish introduced the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
