C ) The visits and activities of inspec@@ tors of the organization are so established that i ) are the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for those of the peaceful nuclear activities as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ y and other the inspec@@ tors of the organization to be aware of the confi@@ dential information is ensured .
&quot; each state turns opposite the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as compared to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the fore@@ rights and exemp@@ tions of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will end in relation to the core material , when the community and the organization has been used , that the material consumed or in a way that it is possible to be used under the point of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , not more usable or virtually non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; the community noti@@ fies the organisation according to this agreement , the transfer of nuclear material from the states are subject to the securing measures after this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will be completed in respect of core material , as soon as the receiving state , as in this agreement , the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization performs documents , from which every transfer and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures arises on the further core material . &quot;
&quot; the core material , the securing measures are subject to the agreement as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , agreed upon the production of alloys or ceramics . in which circumstances the securing measures can be completed after this agreement in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used during the period of non @-@ application measures in accordance with the implementation of nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ es .
B ) The organisation and community meeting a regulation that the securing measures will only be used as long as long as the core material used in such action .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these backup measures are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures will be used again in this agreement as soon as the nuclear material is resumed in a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is distributed over the total amount and the composition of this in the relevant state or the relevant states of such material , from this state or in these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends on affairs as among other things as temporary and proceedings , and dis@@ closure of the reporting , but does not include a cheaper or under secret protection of military activity and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the Community and the States bear the cost that each of them will grow from their respective obligations from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community , the States , or individuals who are subject to their hosts , are subject to an extraordinary cost as a result of a special consideration of the organization , so the organization has given this cost unless they declared in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which demands from inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the states ensure that the liability protection for nu@@ cle@@ ars damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be taken into the organization and their officials for the purposes of this agreement in the same way as to the nationality of the States . &quot;
&quot; each claim to the community or a state opposite the organization or a state opposite the organization or a state of damage - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - which is aimed at the implementation of the securing measures after this agreement , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council , according to the examination of the General Director General information , states that the organization has not been able to fall into consideration that the organization has not been divided into Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Statute in accordance with Article X@@ II ( C ) of the stat@@ ute reports , and may also take part in the other measures . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the applied securing measures , and provides the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties involved - any represented opportunity to grant the necessary security . &quot;

&quot; the aim of the process of securing effect in this Convention is the right discovery of the distribut@@ ing significant nuclear material for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ es for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a track by the risk of discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the article 28 , the material accounting as a securing of basic importance , verb@@ al with spatial intervention and observation are used as important complem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical add@@ ressing of the evaluation by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material image zone , which is not listed for a certain period of accuracy of accuracy limits for the specified seas . &quot;
&quot; when performing its re@@ testing , the organization makes an article 3 full @-@ use of the safety system of the community . &quot;
the control system and control system of the community for core material according to this agreement is based on a breakdown in material zones .
&quot; in use of its backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures are making the following kind of use and they are necessary to see how they are determined in complem@@ entary evenings and purpose , are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of drow@@ ned , produced , lost , lost or any other way out of the continu@@ ance of the core material and the inventory ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and measurement of measurement un@@ certainty ;
&quot; C ) Proce@@ dures to determine , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
E ) processes for assessment of frequent tests and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which has used for any material image zone the core materi@@ al@@ ments and changes of this taxation including one - and outputs of the material image zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) Pre@@ ferences , which will ensure that the accounting procedures and the agreements will be done correctly ; &quot;
h ) Proce@@ dures to refund from reports to the organisation in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
&quot; after this agreement , securing measures are not based on materials in the mining industry or the arch@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ent material , which is not yet achieved under letter c ) , the phase of the nuclear burning period has not yet reached , in the States , the community shares the amount and composition of material provided , unless otherwise non @-@ nu@@ cle@@ ars are introduced ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , which is manufactured , or is this core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear power supply of the United States , so it is subject to the other in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures are terminated in this agreement for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community is , however , is the view that the withdrawal of nuclear material , the securing measures are not possible or desired , consult the organisation and community each other on the application of suitable safety measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures are completed in this agreement , for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community will determine that this core material is practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures to this agreement : &quot;
&quot; a ) special @-@ able material , when it is used in grams - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) Nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ im@@ bur@@ sed , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ open@@ concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; looking for the community , the organisation fre@@ es the organization &apos;s core material , otherwise securing measures to this agreement , provided by these securing measures , if the total , due to this article in the States liberated nuclear material , no time more than &quot;
a ) a kilogram of special p@@ able material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of his weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment that lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above natural uran is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fifth square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) total ten metric tons of natural uran and rounded ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons rounded ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or less ;
&quot; it is supposed to be freed core material along with core material , which is subject to the backup measures after this agreement , processes or stored in the application for re@@ use of the securing measures to the material . &quot;

the special shareholders will be separate and separate from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ tender school , which is to pay in the currency of the organisation as a member of the organisation for the organisation of the organisation of the organisation in the responsible country . &quot;
B ) The payment is carried out in two rates ( although i ) the first in height of at least 45 v . h . membership within 30 days after entry into force this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the amount of contribution to the 1 . January 1979 or at another time that agreed between the EEC and the administrator to the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Every Member State may afford payments before the terminal .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the administrator takes approximately propor@@ tion@@ al pulling on the cash or the school , to cover the expenses for the special care and the special shareholders in appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; with the guarantee of this loan , the administrator can conduct the following factors under the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the scope of the country &apos;s international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) composition , and the tendency of debt service in the country and its further loan capacity to loan conditions without compensation ; and &quot;

&quot; - fresh or cooled he@@ dge , lamb and goats ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the import possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat from Argentina have set the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure a perfect function of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the amount of the amount of the agreed quantity not exceeds the agreed quantity ( frozen or cooled ) according to the conventional offer ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;

&quot; in the event that the community takes the protection of protection , they are obliged to protect themselves from this agreement with New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from New Zealand exceeded the agreed quantities , the community ret@@ ains the right to continue the import from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restri@@ ct the exhau@@ st@@ ion to import the products from this agreement using 10 b.@@ H . AD val@@ o@@ rem .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community will change the community in consultation with New Zealand set in clause 2 fixed quantities , according to the scope of New Zealand trade with each new member state . &quot;

&quot; taking into consideration the objectives and determin@@ ations of this agreement is the community that every actual application is carried out by H@@ amm@@ el and lungs as well as from the cont@@ emp@@ t of specific sheep and lungs , which are in line with the existing international obligations in harmony and the traditional share of community at the Wel@@ than@@ del with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand guarantees compliance with clause 2 mentioned amounts of particular , so that there is no compensation regarding these quantities . &quot;
&quot; in its part , the community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the pre @-@ called products have been dependent on the presentation of a failure license which is named by the New Zealand government . &quot;
&quot; the details for the application of this system are specified so that , on the position of a deposit for issu@@ ing the import licence for fra@@ grant products . &quot;
&quot; in implementing regulations , the competent authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have been granted to regulate the quantities ; these details may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to the destination . &quot;
&quot; the pron@@ unci@@ ation contributes to concern that the agreement will be applied , and are smooth . &quot;
&quot; the pron@@ unci@@ ation regularly checks the tendency to the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goats of the two parties and on the global market as well as the conditions on these markets , including the conditions that are mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the pron@@ unci@@ ation contributes to worry , that the proper application of the agreement is not imp@@ aired that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat will not be executed under the agreement in the agreements on the community . &quot;
&quot; the pron@@ unci@@ ation of the agreement must be submitted to the agreement of the agreement , which will be submitted by a contra@@ ctual party , and recommends the competent authorities suitable solutions . &quot;

&quot; the human whole blood is in ster@@ ile , protected from micro@@ organisms to store and keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during testing and transport necessary periods , which should be stored at a maximum of 30 minutes , while the blood is immediately available for 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentration of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood that has been removed from the largest part of the Plas@@ mas .
&quot; it contains all red blood cells of the unit , which has been won ; other blood cells can be present or can be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid content of the concentration is either from the remaining plasma or of a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic arti@@ f@@ ical solution which was added after the plasma &apos;s distance .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells are used ; the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes volume is used on the label . &quot;
&quot; all necessary processes have to be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , the shut@@ down must be made under use of ster@@ ile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; if an artificial aqu@@ eous solution has been added , the label also has its volume and composition . &quot;
the human dry plasma is extracted through a drying of liquid that sets up at the cent@@ ri@@ fu@@ ging or se@@ di@@ fication of human full blood .
&quot; the human dry plasma is won by refriger@@ ation , or any other method , which is avoided by a den@@ atured of proteins . &quot;
&quot; the dry product can easily dissolve in a water supply , which is equivalent to the liquid level , from which one went to the production of substance . &quot;

&quot; in order to switch the harmful effects of bacterial growth in plasma , blood don@@ ates , the signs of a bacter@@ ium can not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the risk of the transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis , they are no more than 12 donations , or to apply other methods to turn down these danger in comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid volume , which one went out with the production of plasma , corresponding to the water supply ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a set of quant@@ um plasma is dissolved in the water quantity , which was produced by the liquid volume , corresponds to ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;

due to the 24@@ 2 @-@ hour drying @-@ feeding in the presence of phosph@@ orous pent@@ ine under a pressure of less than 0.@@ 02 mm of mercury may not occur in the human dry plasma weight loss above 0.5 % .
&quot; human drying plasma is in an embroi@@ dery atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a ster@@ ile , closed bottle under conclusion of any micro@@ organisms and to store every moisture ; it is light to protect and keep at a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fra@@ ctions from human plasma rot@@ ein are samples from the protein component from which approximately 60 % of the total protein of the plasma @-@ blood cells consist .
&quot; without regard to whether the final product should be flu@@ essi@@ g or dry , the preparation after the addition of a suitable stabili@@ zers must be heated to 60 ° ± 0.5 C for 10 hours to activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ she@@ pat@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in preparation of human alb@@ um@@ in , at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in . &quot;
in both preparations no more than 10 m@@ g. of Immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G can be present per gram of the product .
&quot; if the end product is frozen , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;

&quot; II ) the elec@@ trop@@ ho@@ re@@ se is represented by fre@@ est@@ able particles under an@@ able and suitable conditions , that the protein component of the normal human plasma component has to be at least 95 % and in preparation of fra@@ ctions from human plasma rotating at least 85 % of protein mass . &quot;
&quot; in other preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in and in fra@@ ctions of human plasma , the sodium concentration may not exceed 0,@@ 15 mol per liter solution or recur@@ ring Tro@@ k@@ ken@@ nel . &quot;
the potassium concentration of the fra@@ ctions from human plasma rot@@ ein must not exceed 2 m@@ mol per liter solution or re@@ produced dry pre@@ par@@ ate .
&quot; the pH @-@ value of each preparation has to be reduced to a protein concentration of 10 grams per liter with a solution which contains 0.@@ 15 mol of potassium chloride per liter , at a measurement temperature of 15 to 25 C 6.8 ± 0.2 . &quot;
