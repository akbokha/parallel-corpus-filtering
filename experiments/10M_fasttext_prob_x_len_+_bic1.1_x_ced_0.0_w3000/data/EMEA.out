the present document is a summary of the European public evaluation report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ itarian Ret@@ ard@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) has been evaluated as the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) to achieve recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or treatment , please refer to the package board ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; for more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to import ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B . wir@@ res thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or vision of things that are not present ) , Mis@@ str@@ ust and mad@@ ness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disease , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods ) altern@@ ate with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; in the past , Abi@@ li@@ fy will be used to treat medium @-@ severe episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients suffering from the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness or behavi@@ our@@ al problems when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or melting tablets in patients , which make the swal@@ low of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving other medicines simultaneously , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be dismant@@ led , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is probably mostly known as &quot; partial Ag@@ ents &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ ot@@ onin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin , and d@@ op@@ amine , but in a lower extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter works to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin is playing a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain to norm@@ alize psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the revival of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to a year . &quot;
&quot; in two studies , the effectiveness of injec@@ tions was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases , compared with a placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo which had been stabil@@ ised to 160 patients , where the man@@ ic symptoms have been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies , the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scope for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also contributed studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets , and the solution for setting res@@ or@@ ly ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Ab@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy was significantly more effective than placebo in four of the five short @-@ time studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the resum@@ ption of man@@ ic episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg @-@ doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions decreased more effective than placebo used symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vomiting , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , nausea and exhau@@ st@@ ion , Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ deficiency , In@@ som@@ nie ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the conclusion that the benefits of Ab@@ sch@@ izophren@@ ia ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe episodes of patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and with those man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injec@@ tions in the rapid control of increased rest@@ less@@ ness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if a oral therapy is not suitable , opposite the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. as a approval for the placing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is intended for the treatment of moderate @-@ severe episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in treating sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients of 65 years was not detected .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered as clinical factors ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces and was reported in some cases after onset of an anti @-@ psychological therapy ( see section 4.8 ) .
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that patients with bi@@ polar disorder found no increase in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , trans@@ duc@@ ing disorders ) , cereb@@ ral disorders , treatment with blood pressure ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drug , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; when using AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sent@@ in@@ esis , should be drawn into consideration , reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when there is a patient signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or clear fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ica , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , are removed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be applied to patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the an@@ am@@ nese or at random objects , which are to be applied with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , an elevated ster@@ oid in comparison to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer dos@@ ing , a significant relationship between the dosage and announ@@ cements for un@@ wanted cr@@ us@@ her@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ glyc@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ or or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients who were treated with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic effici@@ ents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk inv@@ alu@@ able for hyper@@ glyc@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic active ingredients treated , which allow direct failure . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ phen@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is observed as side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is charged if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is in combination with alcohol or other central drug medicines with over@@ lay side effects such as se@@ diment ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resignation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a high @-@ effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) , the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l increased by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) , the common application can result in higher plasma concentrations of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should be the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ ly at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
di@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 will be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y as expected by a moderate increase of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no significant effect on the metabol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ an / 3 method@@ ology at / 3 method@@ ology ) and 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be afraid to notify her doctor if she is pregnant or pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation in human beings and due to the reproduction studies in the animal must not be applied , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following adverse events were frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the incidence of side effects below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ is@@ ia , d@@ yst@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled study study , over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment . &quot;
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long time period , over 26 weeks in a placebo controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came , showed no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions were reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their appearance also reported in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ral neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ral neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , un@@ wanted cereb@@ ral neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ osis , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or intenti@@ onal exagger@@ ations were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l alone in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; there is no information on the effectiveness of a hem@@ or@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis has a high plasma binding . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found at sch@@ izophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity for D@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and for ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ches and for hist@@ amine @-@ according receptor .
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy volunteers , the tromb@@ ones emissions Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ mal reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receiver , and at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the P@@ cle@@ us cau@@ tions . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week 52 the proportion of the patients suffering from the group of patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - Depres@@ sions scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo controlled study , more than 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia showed significantly higher reduction in response rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l Group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study enrolled more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly reduced by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks against placebo over 3 weeks . &quot;
in a placebo controlled Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy study more than 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo no superior efficacy .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ arding and active @-@ controlled Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy studies in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over placebo over a week of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of Man@@ ia on such as lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l did not have a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo controlled study , over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion period of 74 weeks , with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l proved to be superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a feedback . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzymes responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is responsible for the N De@@ al@@ ky@@ ic by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the medium @-@ sized elim@@ ination rates lies at nearly 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l with an extensive met@@ abol@@ ition on CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and with nearly 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism over CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic examination of sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients showed no sexually dependent effects . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific analysis for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics found no hint on clin@@ ically significant differences regarding ethnic origin or the impact of the noise to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study of subjects with different gra@@ ft liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of the class C , which is not enough to draw battles on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , reproduction icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and for can@@ o@@ gens had no particular dangers for humans . &quot;
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans so they have only limited and no meaning for clinical use .
the effects of the effects of dos@@ ing @-@ dependent tox@@ icity ( AU@@ C ) at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ state exposure ) in rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 10 times of the average Ste@@ ady @-@ State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ aten of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg of the sul@@ fate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the g@@ all of monkeys , and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which resulted in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ fold of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 Late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which one year or less continued , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found at sch@@ izophren@@ ia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine d@@ 2- and ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ ot@@ onin 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day daily regardless of meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty in swal@@ lowing of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , may take the melting tablets alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ icides behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective distur@@ ban@@ ces , in some cases , after onset of an anti @-@ psychological therapy , also reported in treating Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

the following adverse reactions were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo over 3 weeks against placebo over 3 weeks . &quot;

&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study enrolled more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly reduced by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg . &quot;
97 In a placebo controlled Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy study on 3 weeks with fi@@ xer dosage with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo no superior efficacy .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared to the import of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the relationship between the geomet@@ ric C@@ max value of the solution and the value of tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 After this , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the failure of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ g@@ aten of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys according to repeated oral dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;

AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is applied for rapid control of ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ age in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions should be terminated and started using Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l &apos;s oral application . &quot;
to minim@@ ize the Res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ise the vari@@ ability is recommended an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deeply in the glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
&quot; depending on the individual clinical status , a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be used depending on individual clinical status ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;

there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ our@@ al problems that were different from sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in case of a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins , in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution as necessary , the patients should be observed in terms of extreme resistance or blood pressure . ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
research on safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not recommended for patients with alcohol or drugs ( by written or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ suffici@@ ency , trans@@ duc@@ ing disorders ) , cereb@@ ral disorders , treatment with blood pressure ( de@@ hydr@@ ation drug , treatment with blood pressure reduc@@ ers ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which one year or less continued , there were occasional reports about during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle sti@@ ff@@ ness , changing consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , speed@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac , sweat and arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ her , poly@@ phen@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus or risk factors for diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of deteri@@ oration of the glucose values . &quot;
&quot; in general , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar Man@@ ie due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ d@@ ities , the application of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , with which weight gain is observed as a side effect , and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ el@@ ic@@ l intensity was higher compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) and the same time Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a gast@@ ric acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resignation rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is not relevant to be clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; ) , the common application can result in higher plasma concentrations of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - Prot@@ ective inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose reductions . &quot;
&quot; after setting the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6- or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be lifted to the Dos@@ ish@@ ly at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular received , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was bigger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the incidence of side effects below are defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following effects were frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or placebo were classified as possible medical @-@ relevant side effects ( * ) , in clinical studies ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study study of over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
&quot; in the long time period , over 26 weeks in a placebo controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters came , showed no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporarily and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l treated patients compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;

&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as aggreg@@ iti@@ vity and behavi@@ oral problems , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tions associated with statistically significant improvement in relation to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the observed average improvement of the output value on the P@@ AN@@ SS is Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour final point was 5,8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analysis of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ iti@@ vity , a similar efficacy in relation to total population was observed , but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced patient number . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) compared to placebo a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
in a week 52 the proportion of the patients suffering from the group of patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo controlled study on 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a O@@ lan@@ z@@ ap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study enrolled more than 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly reduced by at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of about 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 111 In a placebo controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l did not have a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo controlled study of 26 weeks , followed by a 74 @-@ week study expansion in various patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l proved to be superior to placebo in terms of prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a review in the man@@ ie . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar to the two formulation .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study , where 460 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters were previously an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients on the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; considering only the patients who were treated for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer , there were no distinction between the drugs for the first time due to metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to patients who had previously received other treatments of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in patients , the breast@@ feeding or before the treatment of low neutr@@ ality numbers in the blood . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el &apos;s medicines in people where the first treatment was not more effective , effective as conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines , and that it should not be given to other pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to Bios@@ ci@@ Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited granted approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is failed and not indicated for the standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ enia ( neutral number of &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; if sens@@ ory neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 is the treatment to interru@@ pt up to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of Dos@@ age custom@@ ization in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
&quot; there were no studies with patients with an adverse kidney function , and there are currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of Dos@@ age custom@@ ization in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 , due to non @-@ sufficient data on the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ arti@@ ular form@@ ulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which might be considerably more pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be placed immediately and treated with symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a unique with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proved , kar@@ di@@ ale inci@@ dents in the indigenous patient collection are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarr@@ hea , these are treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive resources . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied in pregnant or pregnant women , which no effective conception can be applied , besides the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is indispensable . &quot;
women in the poor age should be applied during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is enriched during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
male patients should be advised prior to the treatment of a sperm con@@ formation due to the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can operate on traffic and the ability to serve machines .
the most common and most important inci@@ dents were listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer that were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; neut@@ rop@@ enia was the most striking significant hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; Leu@@ kop@@ enia was reported in 71 % of the patients . &quot;
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients with Abra@@ x@@ ane patients and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; in Table 1 , the side effects listed in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication of studies have occurred ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;

Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ idal 1 The frequency of overweight actions is calculated based on a defined case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no correlation with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli drug that promotes the inter@@ locking of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ es and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing of their land@@ oly@@ mers .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vit@@ al interaction and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in is medi@@ ated by Plas@@ ma@@ osis of Plas@@ ma@@ osis in the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the context of in @-@ vitro studies proved that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el promotes the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved trans@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ ous acceptance is convey@@ ed and due to the alb@@ umin@@ bin@@ der Prot@@ eins SP@@ ARC ( gr@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the field of tum@@ ors occurs .
&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ blind studies and of 4@@ 54 patients , which were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ entr@@ al study was carried out in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with relief for an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without preced@@ ent ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; during inclusion in the study , 64 % of patients had an adverse condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ asis . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metal lubri@@ cation and 19 % due to metast@@ ases and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive &gt; First @-@ Line therapy , are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 .
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to be sound based on Bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane according to &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the effect exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml analogue to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration took on multi@@ phase manner . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a wide range of extra@@ vas@@ cular distribution and / or female integration of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ genetic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solv@@ ent pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ hour injection . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift higher ( 43 % ) as after a solv@@ ent , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was at Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissues , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is reported in the first line of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ Di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) . &quot;
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine decreased with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which points to a wide non @-@ ren@@ al cle@@ ance . &quot;

&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed a biological medicine is similar , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and has the same substance ( also called &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , where in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur if the procedure is not possible , and with which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; treatment with demol@@ ition needs to be conducted under the supervision of a doctor , experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which is displayed for the medicine . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and patients who want to make a self @-@ bleeding in patients , Ab@@ se@@ amed is in@@ jected into a v@@ ein . &quot;
injection can also be made by the patient or of his counsel@@ or if they have received appropriate instructions .
patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency or patients who received chemotherapy should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency consists , and ice @-@ energetic supplements should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems may be caused by a ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ man@@ gel or thereby that the body is not sufficient to affect the body &apos;s own ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in . &quot;
ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ i@@ et@@ in is also used to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reducing the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was capable of providing them to the formation of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to an injection in a V@@ ene in the context of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who caused an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , compared to the reference rate . &quot;
all patients participating in this study was in@@ jected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at least eight weeks before they were either killed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values between the start of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also presented the results of a study , in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled se@@ ams with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients who caused an an@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were included in the same degree as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symp@@ tom@@ y of an en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ ating @-@ poll@@ uted headache and confusion . &quot;
ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa or one of the other components .
&quot; se@@ eding as injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee for Human@@ itarian Ret@@ ard@@ ants ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the medicine has been implemented according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the medicine has a comparable quality , security and efficacy profile like E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information for medical professionals in all member states , including information on the security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission ruled the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG on an auth@@ orization of placing for placing in the entire European Union . &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ ation between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
&quot; depending on the age , gender and overall disease can vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease resistance required by the doctor . &quot;
a increase in hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) should be avoided for a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability of patients , it may occasionally be observed in one patient individual hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be reached by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value exceeds 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored by eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ig to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest dose , which is necessary for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher maintenance doses as a patient , where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b @-@ value ( &lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may be less difficult in patients with which initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week with intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 % / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired target is reached ( this should take into steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on the age , gender and overall disease can vary depending on the age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease resistance is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in vari@@ ability , the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration should be reached by 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be monitored by eng@@ m@@ asch@@ ig to ensure that ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is in the lowest dose , which is necessary for control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) , or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ loid ratio rose by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be retained 150 @-@ kg / kg three times a week or 450 for / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase is &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ loid &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , the dose should be raised to 300 mg / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 kg / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ loid number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl each week , the dose should be kept for 300 mg / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; however , the hem@@ ost@@ able value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the re@@ ti@@ ku@@ si@@ cy@@ tes increased &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the output value , an appeal to ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , which is needed for a dose of 600 blood con@@ serv@@ ings , should be preserved in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before operating surgery . &quot;
&quot; with the iron sub@@ stitution , it should be as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood sp@@ inal program - started , so before the start of the se@@ amed therapy big iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 kg / kg ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , which should be given weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operation and the day of the intervention ( Day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in al@@ fa was pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.e. / kg every 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis on the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ on@@ ical cooking solution to rinse the hose and to ensure a sufficient injection of the drug . &quot;
&quot; patients who were ill among the treatment with any ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in on a ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive any deduc@@ tible or another ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to the treatment , inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep Ven@@ enth@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ or@@ ically known ven@@ ous Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , the application of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa can be contra@@ cted in the following pre@@ - , supporting or cruel disease disease , peri@@ ph@@ ere arter@@ ial illness , vas@@ cular disease of car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ ral disease disease ; in patients with recently restored heart attack or zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine event . &quot;
Ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after a long @-@ year treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in .
&quot; in patients with sudden impact loss , defined as a reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for non @-@ governmental ( iron , fol@@ acid or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium loss , or infections , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ dos value , considering the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ cy@@ tes &quot; Index &quot; ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ tes are normal , the anti @-@ ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone sp@@ inal cord should be weighed for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ icity at sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed patients with a risk of anti @-@ physical induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 suggested upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration .
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular cases were observed when ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ ese stim@@ ulated active ingredients ( ESA ) were given to a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have no significant benefits that is due to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ins when the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ s increased by the control of an@@ es@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required concentration .
the hem@@ ost@@ able rise should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ den@@ ial heart failure , or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 , the de@@ valuation of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia with Epo@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is not accelerated in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine response should be taken into account for the assessment of the treatment of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa gift and ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine response ( patients who may be trans@@ duc@@ ed ) .
if the h@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1,25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,1 m@@ mol / l ) must minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ al events ( see section 4.2 treatment of patients with chem@@ otherap@@ eutic an@@ emia - Dos@@ age custom@@ ization between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment under the participation of the respective patient which should take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should be provided , if possible , prior to the onset of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who under@@ go for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure , they should have an elevated risk of thro@@ mb@@ osis and vas@@ cular diseases , especially in an essential cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ stroke rate of &gt; 13 g / dl can be an elevated risk for postoperative thro@@ mb@@ al / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , ep@@ et@@ ine was not proven to improve the overall survival or the risk of tumour disease with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received chemotherapy first , when a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted &quot;
&quot; ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in will be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; from in @-@ vitro investigations of tumor woven , no evidence is indicated between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ atology differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ mb@@ osis , vas@@ cular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ di@@ ale , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ osis , an@@ em@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under ep@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , so also patients under ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase in blood pressure or deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis ( see section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment of ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; ir@@ respective of the ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treatment , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ates to thro@@ mb@@ otic and vas@@ cular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically modified ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa is gly@@ cem@@ ic and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates , identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , which was isolated from the urine in an@@ odi@@ zed patients . &quot;

survival and tumor trials were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
&quot; in the open study , no difference in total survival between the patients with re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine treated patients and the control patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with recur@@ rent ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine patients treated with an an@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ome consistency , statistically significantly higher mortality than with controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and associated complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ in treated patients and controls are satisfactory .
&quot; there is an elevated risk for th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients who will be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine , and a negative impact on the overall survival can &apos;t be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clari@@ fied how far these results are treated to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ th@@ rop@@ o@@ et@@ ine with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value of 13 g / dl , as a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa provisions after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ value of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ time period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels to be reached after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone market fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency when humans and could be attributable to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .

&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ie , it will break your therapy with se@@ ams and determine how your an@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed through injection must be given into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of a an@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
&quot; when increased or increasing potassium mirror , your doctor may consider an interru@@ ption of treatment with se@@ ams , until the potassium values are again in the norm range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer chronic kidney problems and clin@@ ically @-@ apparent cor@@ on@@ ar@@ er heart disease or storage mark by insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ dings exceeds a particular value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of blood im@@ pover@@ ished is not accelerated with chronic kidney problems ( kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ) that are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ et@@ in @-@ al@@ fa gift and the desired effect should be taken into account for the assessment of efficacy of sections .
&quot; 200 Your doctor will be able to determine your values of red blood @-@ coloured ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) , and custom@@ ize your ab@@ rupt@@ ly dose to keep the risk of bleeding education ( thro@@ mb@@ ot@@ ic event ) as possible . &quot;
&quot; this risk should be derived from the treatment with ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa , especially if you have an elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you already have an elevated risk for thro@@ mb@@ otic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ enth@@ r@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ em@@ bo@@ lie ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patients , you think the se@@ wing as a growth factor for blood cells and certain circumstances can affect the tumour . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edi@@ c operation , the beginning of treatment should be examined and treated accordingly to the cause of your an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood cells ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive a higher risk of blood @-@ drops after surgery . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other drugs / apply or recently taken / used recently as it is not prescription drug .
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( funds for supp@@ ression of the immune system ) during your therapy , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory studies have no interaction between ep@@ et@@ in al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM CS@@ F ) , such as cancer - chemotherapy , or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your blood arm@@ arm@@ ut ( an@@ emia ) is on the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will arrange regular blood tests in order to review the treatment success and ensure that the medicine does not work properly and your hem@@ og@@ lob@@ ster value does not exceed a particular value .
&quot; once you are well stopped , you will receive regular doses of cut @-@ in between 25 and 50 kg / kg twice weekly , distributed onto two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; if a syr@@ inge from the fridge has been taken and room temperature ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days , or be rejected . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones spr@@ inkl@@ es ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high fra@@ cture risk ( bone drops ) , including patients who have recently suffered a s@@ trau@@ matic hips like when they fall down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip fra@@ cture should be received before the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was attracted to the assessment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study almost 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis more than 50 years , who recently suffered a hip fra@@ cture ; the number of fra@@ c@@ tures were examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients with a ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at ) . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ ator for efficacy was , whether the salary of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme , the bone sub@@ distance ) was norm@@ alized in the blood , or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( excluding other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) were reduced by 70 % compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip fra@@ c@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip fra@@ cture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most common side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are frequent in case of repet@@ itive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ orus or one of the other components .
&quot; like with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates in patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion interface and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors , which contains A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as similar material for patients who are explained and pointed out to the doctor when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ art@@ is Europe &apos;s European Commission granted auth@@ orization to include A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hips ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by physicians , experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run@@ time period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently alleged low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , a Initi@@ al dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 , or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended in front of the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ In@@ fusion . &quot;
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
&quot; patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended , as limited clinical experience for this patient group . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elim@@ ination with older patients are similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , because data relating to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness are missing . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
&quot; prior to the beginning of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the treatment of calcium and vitamin D is treated with adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine is developing , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , according to at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad dial@@ hygiene ) should be weighed prior to an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental treatment with adequate preventive tooth treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental handles are no data available , whether the interru@@ ption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw range . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the untreated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of severe adverse adverse effects of pre@@ hop@@ ed cases was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , Horizon - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall sti@@ ff@@ ness of pre@@ hop@@ ed between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in Table 1 . &quot;
kidney @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney problems that expressed as decrease of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney disease and a restricted kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after the gift was observed in 1.8 % of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo @-@ treated patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mol / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures after a hip fra@@ cture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical questionna@@ ires , the vitamin D mirrors have not been rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however , the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion interface such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the Kiev area Gel@@ eg@@ t@@ ally , above all in cancer patients with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infections including oste@@ opathy itis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other D@@ ental@@ . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients occurred oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis in a pine area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and with placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of super@@ vis@@ ation , which leads to a clinical relevant Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia , can be achieved by the gift of oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ at . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( BM@@ D ) -@@ t @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 1.5 and an BM@@ D @-@ T score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without any signs of an existing spine .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine ( A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ) significantly increased over a period of three years and already after one year the incidence of one or several new spine ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rates compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip fra@@ c@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a pointed a similar effect on three years , which resulted in a reduced by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar @-@ cast acid , hips and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo @-@ treatment significantly to all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % increase in the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the entire th@@ ig@@ h by 6.0 % , and the lower radius by 3.2 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , were taken after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies from the pel@@ let . &quot;
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in chronic bone volume with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in comparison to placebo .
bone @-@ specific phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study period .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the output value until 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the output value by 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value by 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of the patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total mortality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment in comparison to placebo @-@ treatment the BM@@ D ( BM@@ D ) to all time points .
&quot; compared to placebo @-@ treatment , the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment carried out about 24 months compared to placebo @-@ treatment to increase the BM@@ D by 5.4 % in total sales and 4.3 % at the shr@@ ink@@ age . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon R@@ FT study were randomised , 508 men were random@@ ized , and 185 patients were evaluated by BM@@ D after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical fra@@ c@@ tures in men ; the prevalence of clinical questionna@@ ires was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % compared to placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was related to the following weekly gift of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in comparison to the percentage of Len@@ den@@ dr@@ bel @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ boo Pa@@ get of the bone of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years ago with radi@@ ologically confirmed mor@@ row Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3.@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
&quot; 11 The effectiveness of a fusion of in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid once a day , during 2 months , was detected in two six months of compar@@ ative studies . &quot;
&quot; when combined results , a similar decrease of pain strength and pain was observed in comparison to the initial value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified at the end of the six @-@ month main study as a respon@@ der ( in therapy according to therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach could be treated at 141 of the patients with a ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared with 71 who treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at patients , in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ off and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients de@@ posed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic data that proved in@@ dos@@ is@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rose rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; ru@@ bi@@ al disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elim@@ ination phase with a season Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ utter speed t ½ to 146 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ called ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the prescribed dose occurs in urine , while the rest is bound mainly on bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body cle@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , breed or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ concentration against time ) . &quot;
&quot; an reduces cle@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes of metabolic substances is unlikely , because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is not met@@ abo@@ lized - because it is a weak or not direct or not direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) cor@@ related the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 evaluated patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; from this , this makes a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function of up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose to dose of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; as for heavy kidney interference ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ let@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al om@@ ission . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats , in total 6 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2 @-@ 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of human @-@ therapeutic exposure , relative to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repet@@ itive ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects in other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection interface . &quot;
&quot; the most common findings in studies with repeated application was an advanced primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aph@@ hy@@ se of long bones in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a result that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of substance . &quot;
&quot; in rats , one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such skel@@ eton . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of the low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage and conditions before application ; usually 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic is a representative of a sub@@ sid@@ y class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ orus , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ rogen formed from Andro@@ s , play a role in the rather gradu@@ al loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is made fast , and new bone material is un@@ arranged , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works , norm@@ alized the bone structure , ensuring a normal bone formation and thus gives strength to the bones again . &quot;
&quot; if you need to submit to dental treatment or need to under@@ go a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other pharmac@@ euticals , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or care staff if you have taken other medicines / apply or recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known for the kidneys . &quot;
for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a together with food and beverages allow you to take enough liquid in accordance with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that will be administered by your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
&quot; if you have broken the hips , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the keeper . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg , which will be administered by your doctor or care personnel as in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you will need a further dose only after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions , so the calcium @-@ mirror in your blood is not too low after the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed , you immediately link to your doctor or a hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; prior to the end of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you will begin the termination of the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next physician time and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions are less frequently . &quot;
&quot; in the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , fever and ch@@ ills , muscle - or joint pain and headache , apply within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a recently alleged low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip fra@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be sufficient to provide sufficient liquid with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid integration of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic abandoned , Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able to ensure patient with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , a starting dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ ang@@ ular or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended prior to in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is used in addition to a diet and movement for the treatment of adult patients who suffer from obesity ( body mass index ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • the overweight ( BMI of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond .
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was used compared to a placebo as a supp@@ or@@ ator of the space . &quot;
&quot; to the studies of the smokers , however , showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA was severely affected on this application area . &quot;
what risk is associated with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA ? it is the most common side effects of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA that were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper breath . ng the full list of side effects in connection with A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA reported side effects .
&quot; it must also be applied in patients with patients who suffer from an existing severe depression , or with anti@@ depress@@ ants , because the risk of depression is increasing and among others in a small minority of patients Su@@ izi@@ dge@@ . &quot;
caution is offered when using A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means for use at H@@ IV@@ - infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or Cl@@ arith@@ me@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . LN
&quot; at the conclusion , the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the effectiveness of A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight &quot;
&quot; medicines are applied to patients who require health and non @-@ cosmetic reasons ( by provision of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ants for patients and doctors ) , and to support the Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to a diet and movement for the treatment of a obesity ( BMI ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which feature one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ COMP@@ L@@ IA is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 on the basis of absence of data to the effectiveness and happiness .
&quot; La Depres@@ sive disorders or voting changes with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported , up to 10 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; GE and with depres@@ sive disorders may not be applied to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , unless the benefit of treatment in individual case is excessive risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients suffering from obesity - no recogni@@ zable risks , depres@@ sive reactions may occur . &quot;
members of members or other nearby persons are to prove that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ appear of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice when these symptoms arise . l@@ n
• El@@ derly patients The effectiveness and the confidenti@@ ality of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during the treatment of patients over 75 years were not sufficient .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or stroke . ) in front of less than 6 months were carried out by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant . l@@ n

&quot; to the following table ( Table 1 ) , the following table showed un@@ wanted effects in placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients who were treated to weight reduction and due to accompanying substance disorders . &quot;
&quot; if the incidence was statistically significant higher than the corresponding placebo ( for un@@ wanted effects ≥ 1 % ) , or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ wanted effects &lt; 1 % ) . ng &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0.01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; &quot;
&quot; in a toler@@ ability study , in which a limited number of persons can be administered by up to 300 mg , only light symptoms were observed . &quot;
the patients had a BMI of 30 kg / m ² or BMI &gt; 27 kg / m ² and one simultaneously existing hyper@@ tension and / or Dy@@ sli@@ pi@@ an@@ emia .

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an output value of 7.9 % for both groups ) was -@@ 0,8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo &quot;
the percentage of patients who reached a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant Group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the middle weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and placebo group was 3.8 kg ( C@@ I@@ 95 % -@@ 5,0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; improving the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg , about 50 % of the direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and approximately 50 % are explained by the weight reduction . n at home Ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; after 13 days , the ste@@ ady @-@ State plasma bars were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 ng / ml ; C@@ us@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14.@@ 1 ng / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 268 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) . &quot;

patients with black skin colour can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C patients with other ethnic populations .
n most popular har@@ mac@@ in@@ etic analysis ( age @-@ spectrum 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75@@ - year @-@ old patient is estimated at 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C higher than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old
&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data on the safety of the un@@ wanted effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , but have been assessed as relevant for clinical use in the human@@ ist area , possibly relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions seem to be connected with process @-@ related stress as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; in case , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery of the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no adverse effects were observed on the Fer@@ til@@ ity or Zykl@@ us@@ sion@@ ists . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on the pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat at doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .

&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ish or insulin can be maintained with the onset of acet@@ yl@@ glyc@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should be reduced to the dose of Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin can be used better , and the blood sugar level can be adjusted better by adding type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of acet@@ one in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant , in addition they received either acet@@ ylene or placebo for 3.5 years . &quot;
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured as well as the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood glucose levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of acet@@ one and a sulph@@ ur@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study included in the combination of acet@@ ate and insulin in 289 patients , the patients who received an account in addition to insulin values increased from 0.@@ 69 % to 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were vision problems , infections of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts ( cold ) , weight gain and hypo@@ aes@@ thes@@ ia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ating ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may neither be applied to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , still in patients with liver problems , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency or diabe@@ tic acid can ( high @-@ level mirror - acid mirror - in the blood ) . &quot;
it was decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in case of some use ) is to serve as an alternative to the standard line with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited issued an approval for the account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and wear the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient and in@@ appropriate to those met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ ability ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years , no data is available , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. spring heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain or o@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of a heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , showed no increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver enzy@@ mic values ( AL@@ T &gt; 2,5 x upper limit of the standard ) or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors have increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzyme values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that prove to an animal dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nausea , vomiting , th@@ ri@@ ms problems , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ mic values . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is continued , should be conducted by the laboratory parameters of clinical evaluation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can stir from fatty deposits and is connected in some cases with a liquid inspection . &quot;
as a result of a hem@@ og@@ gy group ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity in patients , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used as oral and triple combination therapy with insulin @-@ dependent therapy with insulin @-@ dependent hy@@ po@@ glyc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ genetic mac@@ ular de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ular de@@ pl@@ ums , but ad@@ mitt@@ ent doctors should be aware of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ o@@ de@@ ma when patient should be considered distur@@ ban@@ ces of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages , randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical studies have been treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of a pregnancy , and if one patient wishes a pregnancy or occurs , the treatment is ab@@ dic@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for investig@@ ating inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on have no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ lized by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a , Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a decrease in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one dimin@@ ished hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the breast and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for rub@@ bing growth .
&quot; very frequently &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the Tur@@ g@@ ors , and the lens of the lens , as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic drugs . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T lead over three times the upper limit of the standardi@@ zation included often as under placebo , but less commonly referred to as in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ v . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , rarely more than heart failure in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was reported , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ nese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of messages un@@ wanted events relating to bon@@ fires , randomised , controlled clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients treated with compar@@ ative medi@@ ation group . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years running the PRO@@ active trial , fra@@ c@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; when taking a maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days have no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have a activation of specific kernel recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) , which leads to an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ eton muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose evaluation in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as a mon@@ otherapy has been carried over two years to investigate the time until leaving the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the beginning of the therapy after two years after the start of therapy , a blood glucose monitoring ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was observed in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study more than 12 months , patients who were in@@ adequate and placebo were random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo in spite of three months . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continue to have insulin ; a reduction of insulin in which was treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was checked in a small , 18 @-@ week analysis of type 2 diabe@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo a reduction in plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ cer@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was no statistically significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de reduced values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ glyceri@@ de mirror , but also improved the post@@ ulated tri@@ glyceri@@ de mirror , which also improved over a effect on the Tri@@ gly@@ cer@@ eri@@ d absorption , as well as the drug tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ active trial , a cardiovascular Out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , and pre @-@ existing m@@ acro@@ vas@@ cular disease , were random@@ ized in groups of 2 diabetes mell@@ itus , which received an existing anti@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on becomes fast res@@ or@@ ly , with the top concentration of the un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the plasma usually takes 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness in roughly the triple of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one could not have a relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or reduces the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral use of radioactive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the subjects ( 55 % ) and found a lower degree in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination rates of un@@ changeable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to the people 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , although the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the parent is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed according to repeated administration of plasma volume magni@@ fication with hem@@ at@@ ric cardi@@ ac disease hyper@@ trop@@ hy . &quot;
this is the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one dimin@@ ished hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fine growth .
long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ Asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( in male rats ) .
&quot; in a veter@@ inary model of family @-@ omat@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased incidence of colon@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
the calculated fra@@ cture incidence was 1.9 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated women and 1.1 questionna@@ ires per 100 patient years with women who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation .
&quot; in the PRO@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , questionna@@ ires were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0,5 fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a comparison medi@@ ation . &quot;
in another study about two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in each of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
&quot; in clinical trials over 1 year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Qu@@ oti@@ ves compared to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the tri@@ glyceri@@ de mirror , but improved in addition to the postoperative tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption , as well as the drug Tr@@ y@@ g@@ eri@@ d absorption . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the objective of its primary end@@ point , a combination of the total mort@@ al , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ isation , leg amp@@ utation above the kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les , cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , lay the results close to taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular long @-@ term risk . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was used in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pan@@ cre@@ atic gland can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is not able to use insulin effective . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which indicates that the blood sugar level was significantly reduced as with another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human@@ oid ( r@@ DNA ) or any other components .
&quot; in addition , the cans of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can be applied to blood sugar ( the full list is to take part in the packing case ) . &quot;
&quot; at the conclusion , the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was over the risks of diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission announced the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S issued an approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre@@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initi@@ ale effect is desired with a longer lasting effect .
injec@@ tions must be used under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is in@@ jected .
&quot; patients , whose blood glucose levels have improved considerably by an intensive insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; each change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ effective , bi@@ phase , long @-@ effective insulin , human@@ kind or insulin analogue ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin @-@ animal origin ) can lead to that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if switching to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane when patient is required , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after switching . &quot;
&quot; some patients , with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already known signs of cryst@@ alline deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or plaster ( &quot; stones &quot; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ure@@ acid level occurs after two to four weeks , more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
during the first treatment cases still tox@@ ins can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that the patients take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines for the prevention of tox@@ ic@@ an@@ cies .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t because it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to placebo ( a different medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; the main inde@@ ator for efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary mirror , with the last three measurements under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg of revenues , and 65 % ( 175 from 269 ) of patients who once daily 120 mg of income , with the last three measurements showed an ur@@ inary mirror in the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 out of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ hea , nausea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart failure in the pre@@ history , an increased risk of certain side effects , which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion of the Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ure@@ tic acid in blood , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the ambul@@ ance ) , or currently present in the present peri@@ odi@@ ous and / or a gyp@@ sies ( arthritis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the serum levels of serving after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still more &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg can be considered daily . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney applications , the efficacy and safety has not been fully investigated ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people there are no experiences in children and young people , the use of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; as there is no experiences in organ transplan@@ t , the application of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease in patients with chronic cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ com@@ pen@@ sive heart failure is not recommended ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic drug medicines , it can occur during the opening of a acute tox@@ ic@@ ation because through the lowering of the serum acid level , the ure@@ tic acid can be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. for mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , L@@ esch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) is the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases so far that it comes to a deposits in ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver disease During the phase 3 clinical trials were observed in the clinical trials of the liver function with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the February ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin Z@@ was not performed in@@ effective studies to Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin@@ s ( a inhibit@@ ing of Met@@ abol@@ ism of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ lin was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
&quot; in case of subjects , the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily was associated with an increase of Feb@@ u@@ o@@ stat@@ ute ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical trials the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors did not exist in connection with a clinical significant increase of adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ inated d / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at can be applied together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without that a dose can be required for Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at or the same time .
&quot; in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x a medium 22 % increase in AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , which indicates a possible weak bar@@ b@@ ish effect of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme . &quot;
&quot; Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , which is delayed by Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C causes . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies do not leave on side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the tax of a vehicle , used by machines or in exercising , until they can be reas@@ onably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a paying higher incidence of testing reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ ol Group ( 1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no col@@ al correlation was found with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , risk factors were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or de@@ com@@ compens@@ ated heart failure in the ambul@@ ance . &quot;
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) in connection with the medicine could be reported and reported in all Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once reported are listed below .
diarr@@ hea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated simultaneously with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials have no severe skin attacks or severe exagger@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; 7 Open @-@ term renewal studies in the open long @-@ term renewal studies have been treated by 906 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; during the long @-@ term - extension studies , reported events were similar to those reported in the studies of Phase 3 ( see Table 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the following treatment events were reported in all Feb@@ u@@ stat@@ u@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once and stood in patients receiving Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an ex@@ positioning time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the information occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment cases were either reported in the P@@ iv@@ ot@@ al studies of phase 3 for this doses either or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ li@@ pi@@ an@@ a@@ emia , insom@@ nia , sle@@ e@@ at@@ ism , striking dysfunction , rash , rash , Bur@@ sit@@ is , abnormal dysfunction , increase of potassium concentration in the blood , decline of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , decline in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
active mechanism ur@@ ic acid is the end product of Pur@@ in@@ metabolic ism and is formed within the scope of reaction cas@@ ade Hy@@ po@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is a real , not Pur@@ in @-@ sel@@ ective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ X@@ O ) with a Ki @-@ value for the in vitro @-@ shirt , which is below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study of patients who were the last three monthly serum levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum incre@@ mental value of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statistically significant over@@ su@@ peri@@ ority levels below 6 mg / dl ( see table 2 and Figure 1 ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional cans of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant over@@ su@@ peri@@ ority under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum acid level on &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed during the physician visit in week 2 and maintain lasting over the entire treatment .
&quot; in 509 patients Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol received 300 mg 1 x daily , 10 patients with serum exchange values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function applications The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with ren@@ al function applications ( d. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point is 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences regarding the percentage of serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney problems ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum concentration ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; in two years , data from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that the permanent decrease of the serum levels were reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients were needed in the months of 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in tox@@ ic@@ ular size , which in 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of plaster up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at to dos@@ ing easier and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed , greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportional increase is observed . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multi@@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2,8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clinical significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in the serum concentration , if this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at lies in the range of 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma binding of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved via the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C mark@@ eters Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose found in urine as an un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ ations about the urine , about 45 % of the dose also found as the un@@ changeable Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ ash@@ ore of the mode ( 1 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency the C@@ max of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total AU@@ C from Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 m g / ml / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 m w / ml in the group with heavy kidney function . &quot;
&quot; 12 liver function , depending on taking multi@@ pler doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites were not significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
&quot; age There were no significant changes in regards to AU@@ C of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at , or its metabol@@ ites according to the multi @-@ level doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects . &quot;
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ ic , impair@@ ment of fermentation in male rats , a statistically significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ome and carcin@@ oma ) was found in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the high @-@ dosed group , with about 11 times of exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specialized Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine composition as a result of the clinical use as not relevant .
it was found that Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the ferti@@ lization and reproductive power of male and female rats .
&quot; at high doses , approximately 4 @-@ 3 times of human therap@@ eutical exposure , maternal tox@@ icity , entered with a decrease of up@@ lifting capacity and a development delay in the offspring of rats . &quot;

&quot; if you have a tox@@ ic@@ ation ( sudden occurr@@ ence of severe pain , sensitivity , redness , heat and joint swelling ) , wait until the tox@@ ic@@ ation before you start with the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with any case , but also in you , especially during the first treatment weeks or - mon@@ ate , occur if you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC . &quot;
your doctor will pun@@ ish you with any other drugs to prevent a tox@@ ic@@ ation or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have taken other drugs / apply or recently taken / used recently as it is not prescription drug .

&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 have already been used separately from each other in pharmac@@ euticals , which are registered in the European Union , the company presented dates from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , to improve the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirrors have been treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who exclusively had Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate income ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also presented data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose is the dose that is required in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of movement apparatus ( muscles , bones , joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( diarr@@ hea ) , ul@@ cers , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ hea ) , infl@@ ated ab@@ dom@@ es ( low abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ di@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with v@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied for diseases of the feeding tube , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand upright or sitting at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission announced the European Commission to Mer@@ ck Sharp &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following references are accurate to follow the risk of mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ations and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is supposed to be swallowed up only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not cut the tablet or tablet in the mouth , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not take place before taking the tablet for 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical intervention in the upper gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can only be given under special attention ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ est@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ al , followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al Stri@@ ps , were reported in patients under taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( partially these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor should pay attention to all signs and symptoms that are to be pointed out on possible mal@@ ign@@ an@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , such as dy@@ nasty ag@@ ie , pain at the swal@@ lowing or retro@@ spec@@ ular pain or new or slightly lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ d@@ burn ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients , taking the medicine not correct and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that refer to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ages are given to the patient and understood from patients ( see section 4.2 ) .

there are no data available to indicate whether the ab@@ etting of a bis@@ phosph@@ onal therapy in patients who require a j@@ aw surgical procedure that reduces risk of oste@@ on@@ cro@@ sis of the j@@ aw .
clinical assessment by the untreated doctor is crucial for the treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
&quot; the patients should be instructed , that they should be taking the tablet to the next morning when taking a dose to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , after having noticed their sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; they should not take two tablets in the same day , but taking a tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day of the week . &quot;
other illnesses that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the start of therapy .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some or@@ ale drugs may affect the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific inter@@ viewer studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly produced drugs , without being clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use with post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither to apply during pregnancy or pregnant women .

&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial in 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were presented , with the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with pro@@ gra@@ ven / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of the efficacy was the number of patients , where the transplan@@ tation was broken after a treatment duration of a year ( by example , considering how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t were carried out and investigated how Ad@@ vag@@ raf is absorbed by the body as compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;
&quot; Tre@@ mor ( trem@@ bling ) , headache , nausea , vomiting , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ tension ) , diabetes , increased potassium content of blood ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) as well as sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( in@@ som@@ ite ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with v@@ int@@ ent hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ antibiot@@ ic antibiotics ( such as ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines will be taken at the same time with ad@@ vag@@ raf , since the ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the simultaneously recorded medication may be adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ted yellow @-@ orange jel@@ lies , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule surface with &quot; &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; &quot; and on the orange capsule with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; &quot; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only doctors who are familiar with the immune soup @-@ intensive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ ts , this medication should be transferred or changes in the immune soup @-@ intensive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences between the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to gra@@ ft reactions or an increased incidence of side effects , including sub or over@@ immune soup . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; det@@ ailing the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of one in transplan@@ tation medical devices ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a row of conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adap@@ t@@ ations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dose of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of de@@ structive and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below )
&quot; according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirrors should be controlled before switching and over two weeks after switching . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 the systemic exposure , measured as valley level , was comparable with both formulation and kidney transplan@@ ts . &quot;
careful and repeated inspec@@ tions of the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Tal@@ mirrors have been recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure reasonable substance exposure in the immediate transplan@@ t phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the patient in the first postoperative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of concentration to the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) . &quot;
&quot; duration of application to supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft of gra@@ ft , the immun@@ op@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy is not specified . &quot;
Dos@@ age Recommend@@ ations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of the oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; further Dos@@ age custom@@ iz@@ ations can be needed later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplan@@ tation . &quot;
canned recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft proph@@ yla@@ xis The oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be turned to a daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice a daily intake of Ad@@ hes@@ raf , so this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a change@@ over of other immun@@ o@@ zo@@ di@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily the treatment with kidney transplan@@ tation were recommended for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transplan@@ tation For adult patients who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recei@@ vers , probably there is no clinical experience with ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung cancer , pan@@ cre@@ atic and dar@@ m@@ transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
Dos@@ age custom@@ ization in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function for maintaining blood cells in the targeted area can be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a dose of dose required .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , can be assumed that a dose is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum levels , calculation of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and a monitoring of ure@@ volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the change@@ over from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ter to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is careful ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley level in full bl@@ ut The dose should be based on clinical assessment of de@@ structive and toler@@ ability in individual case of full blood @-@ l@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended for frequent controls in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley level , during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ tal@@ es of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be able to change levels of pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ age custom@@ ization , amendments to the immune soup or for simultaneous use of substances which could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adap@@ t@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has arrived . &quot;
the data in clinical studies suggest that a successful treatment in most cases is possible if the valley level is not exceeded in the blood 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley level of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is usually in the first time after liver transplan@@ t@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and for ch@@ illed patients with 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardiovascular disease , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe adverse events , including transplan@@ ting , or other side effects , which can occur in a row by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; det@@ ailing the formulation or the regime should only be performed under the eng@@ aging control of one in transplan@@ tation medical devices ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft lubri@@ cation , which proved to be proved in other immune soup as a therapies , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ard@@ ated formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
the proph@@ yla@@ xis of the transplan@@ t of gra@@ ft and gra@@ ft reactions in childhood are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ardi@@ zed formulation of Ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions that can lead to a reduction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a fusion of clinical effect , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ation ) , or other plant @-@ enh@@ ancing during a treatment with ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea is a particularly careful monitoring of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentration in the blood since the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels can be subjected to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
&quot; in rare cases under Pro@@ gra@@ f , chamber or sept@@ um hyper@@ trop@@ hy was observed , which can also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; further factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are an existing heart suffer , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver disorders , infections , liquid over@@ load and oils . &quot;
&quot; like with other immun@@ o@@ zo@@ di@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes through suitable clothing or using a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pre@@ aches such as headache , changes awareness of consciousness , cr@@ amps and vision problems should demonstrate a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ kap@@ ow@@ ls , ret@@ ardi@@ zed , l@@ act@@ ose , is charged with patients with the rare her@@ ed@@ itary g@@ act@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ absorption . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pharmac@@ euticals or herbal medic@@ inal products known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or lower .
&quot; therefore , therefore , the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels in the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism to monitor and comply with the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to ensure consistent concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with An@@ tim@@ y@@ kot@@ ika , such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ icon@@ az@@ ole , and with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic antibiot@@ ic acid , and HIV @-@ prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics studies revealed that the increase of blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ing of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal contamination . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ level pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute abor@@ tion actions , the concentration of t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can increase or lower . &quot;
&quot; effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us on metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous application of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be met@@ abo@@ lized by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism affect . &quot;
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduces the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid contra@@ cep@@ tive and thus raise the hormone exposure , is particularly careful to be careful about the recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us decrease the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ az@@ on and extend their semi @-@ este@@ em .
the results of a low number of examinations on transplan@@ t@@ ation@@ ists do not provide an indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us compared to other immun@@ o@@ zo@@ di@@ va compared to other immun@@ o@@ zo@@ di@@ va compared to other immun@@ o@@ deficiency events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy .
&quot; in u@@ ter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born on event@@ ual harmful effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( particularly with its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; it is the risk of early birth ( &lt; Week 37 ) and a hyper@@ an@@ ali@@ an@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , ie : &quot;
the secondary profile of immun@@ os@@ yn@@ si@@ va is often affected because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are common side effects according to their frequency : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not acceptable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and paras@@ itic diseases How well @-@ known in other high @-@ effective immune soup is treated with patients who are treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the vulner@@ ability of infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ otic , prot@@ o@@ zo@@ ic ) . &quot;
cases of BK @-@ virus associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive anti @-@ fo@@ al leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ kel@@ etal therapy including Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant ne@@ op@@ las@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in conjunction with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and Plas@@ map@@ rot@@ eine can be accepted that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and a co@@ dynamic effects on molecular level , the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us will be convey@@ ed by its li@@ aison to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell inner . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of sign@@ age to the T @-@ cell and prevents the tran@@ scription of a particular number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes .
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ ressed the activation of the T @-@ cells and the cells dependent prolifer@@ ation of the B @-@ cells , furthermore the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ kin@@ en ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; kidney transplan@@ tation The efficacy and safety of ad@@ vag@@ raf and pro@@ gra@@ f was compared each in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , compared with 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t . &quot;
&quot; patients @-@ survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.9 % for Ad@@ vag@@ raf and 9@@ 7.5 % for pro@@ grave ; in the Ad@@ vag@@ raf arm met 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) deaths . &quot;

&quot; in total , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies published the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was applied for liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac disease to primary immun@@ o@@ dom@@ est@@ ation . &quot;
L@@ ung@@ icide transplan@@ tation In an intermediate analysis of recently conducted multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported in more than 110 patients that were either called T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
&quot; in the first year after gra@@ ft transplan@@ tation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ates syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8,@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0,8 % in the t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients , it was in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to become a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis in comparison to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted by T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) , and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) , patients were bigger ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syn@@ dro@@ ms was significantly lower in patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
a multic@@ entr@@ al study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who were used simultaneously a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation that were used at the same time a pan@@ cre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
&quot; the oral initi@@ al@@ dose ( by protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0,2 mg / kg / day , and after reaching the targeted valley level of 8 to 15 ng / ml per day . &quot;
&quot; cancer transplan@@ t The published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study of oral transplan@@ t@@ ations showed 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ines and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transplan@@ ts ) under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;

factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ rit@@ ual and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in un@@ bound faction of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids to be responsible for transplan@@ tation observed in higher cle@@ ance rates .
&quot; this suggests that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is almost entirely met@@ abo@@ lized , with the ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly across the gendar@@ mer@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; in stable patients suffering from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) on Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was less than below a gra@@ pher . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended for frequent controls in the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ valley level , during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during the maintenance therapy . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one of the lack of factor VIII ) .
the dosage and frequency of application is based on whether Adv@@ ate for the treatment of bleeding or prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing bleeding problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but according to a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell that was brought into a gene ( DNA ) that enables them to formation of the human inner factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another in the European Union &apos;s approved medicines called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , similar , but it will be different , so the medicine contains no proteins human@@ kind and animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical intervention . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding during prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood p@@ bs were awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or with &quot; good . &quot; &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances may not be applied to patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human body factor VIII , Maus@@ oleum , or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission announced B@@ ax@@ ter AG &apos;s approval for placing in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the sever@@ ity of the factor VIII deficiency , according to the place and the extent of bleeding and clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; for the following h@@ olog@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or in i.e. / C ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment is eliminated .
injection of all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger is passed by the patient .
&quot; during treatment , to the control of the prescribed dose and frequency of injec@@ tions a reasonable measurement of the factor VIII plasma level . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their reaction to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 , of factor VIII per kg of body weight in the distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plasma activities cannot be reached , or if the blood is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be weighed . &quot;
&quot; the administration speed should be addressed after the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutral antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; this inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII , Ig@@ G Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma using modified Beth@@ es@@ da Ass@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , whereby the risk depends on the first 20 Ex@@ positions in the largest and genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Exclu@@ ding and analog inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re @-@ occur ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors are observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare list of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who have previously untreated patients who have previously untreated patients who have previously untreated patients , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( frequency on the basis of the available data is not acceptable ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of blood circulation factor VIII @-@ Spiegel@@ s appeared in post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ or .
&quot; during all time , blood cl@@ ots have been calculated during the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 . postoperative day . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure compared to 26 ex@@ propri@@ ations with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
furthermore the 53 p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of 6 years and diagnosed with a severe severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) according to previous exposure compared to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentration ( ≥ 50 days ) .
&quot; in previously untreated patients , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients treated inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of the patients on traces of contam@@ inated proteins was analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against this proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell@@ ulose , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that affect an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients the occurr@@ ence of the occurr@@ ence of Ur@@ g@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash , and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ er gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions in the context of the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has been reported on excessive reactions from allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) . &quot;

&quot; based on the basis of the initial access data , the CH@@ MP has continued to be evaluated as a positive rating , but in consideration that the safety profile of the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot;
&quot; therefore , CH@@ MP is based on the basis of the security filter of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which is necessary to apply for every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for further extensions in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) committee that the company takes its request to auth@@ orization of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , the breast , the brain , the bones , or the wheat parts ( tissues , which connects other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and backs ) thereof . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus that genetically modified , that it may bear a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; that has been changed so that there is no copies of itself and therefore not trigger the infection with humans . &quot;
&quot; in advance , Adv@@ ex@@ in should be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors and allow the canc@@ er@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the restoration of damage DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow further and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer in the area of under@@ mining , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP tested the answers to the company , there were still some questions un@@ explained . &quot;
&quot; based on the testing of the initially submitted documents , CH@@ MP will be submitted to a list of questions which will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits to the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug using the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in reliable ways and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company continued the CH@@ MP if the withdrawal of consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical trials or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered mode of action , means that the tablets are so combined that one of the effective components is immediately released , and the other slowly released over a few hours . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( h@@ ay fever ) in patients with a allergy against p@@ ollen in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ til@@ itis ( c@@ logged nose ) .
adults and adolescents from 12 years is the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as soon as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may cause the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
&quot; the main measurements were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the h@@ ay fever symptoms , which were reported from patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in viewing of all loc@@ u@@ pf@@ u@@ pf@@ ens@@ y@@ symptoms out of the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported patients who were Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6,0 % compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients suffering from p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;

&quot; with patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or one of the other components , against ad@@ ren@@ al active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another drug for treating aller@@ gies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze must not be applied in patients with hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , cardiovascular disease ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission announced a approval for placing Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to swal@@ low in the whole ( i.e. without them to break , break or che@@ w ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied to children under 12 years due to the lack of data for the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the duration of application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after cutting the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application period to 10 days , as long as long @-@ term application , the activity of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin can take away . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory system , the treatment can be continued with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; as Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin , the medicine is also contra@@ sted with patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or and within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , l@@ act@@ amine , Di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ em@@ iv@@ a ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine , oxy@@ gen@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and does not submit data to provide appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
safety and the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function and do not submit data to provide appropriate recommendations to the dosage .
&quot; the patients need to be informed that treatment with the occurr@@ ence of hyper@@ tension or speed@@ y@@ kar@@ or , or pal@@ pit@@ ations , arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neurolog@@ ical symptoms ( such as headache , or rein@@ forcement of head@@ aches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from patients with cardiovascular disease • patients suffering from hyper@@ tension • patients suffering from hyper@@ tension • patients with hyper@@ tension , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder cancer , or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ a in the An@@ am@@ nese . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze is ab@@ dic@@ ated at least 48 hours before implementing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine prevent positive reactions to prevent skin reactions or in their magn@@ itude .
&quot; in addition to clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin who were administered in addition to ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , however , no clinical relevant inter@@ actions or changes of Plas@@ ma@@ concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ om@@ ot@@ or@@ ical tests , no significant differences were detected between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; it was not identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; the im@@ pregn@@ ation of the application of aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; as the reproductive studies of animals are not always transferred to humans , and thus should not be applied to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ous properties of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be clari@@ fied however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ ading , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) . &quot;

&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pon@@ y rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the inhibit@@ ing of free @-@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 out of human ma@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ug@@ sion@@ ol@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ sel@@ ess on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; for a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg of no influence on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage can cause further sympath@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S ar@@ ous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ aze Tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant@@ agon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , determined by the overall co@@ res for the symp@@ tom@@ atic ( except Nas@@ en@@ schlei@@ m@@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze tablets , with regard to the swelling effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze pills showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ aze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin at day 10 was reached . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was performed with the formulation of healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has been very rare . &quot;
a component @-@ interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin following the sole gift of p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin bio@@ equivalent was for exposure to the gift of a Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , for tox@@ icity with repet@@ itive gift , to Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and the reproductive @-@ icity , however , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;
the combination possessed no greater tox@@ icity than their individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredients P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin .
&quot; in reproductive @-@ alloy studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin in the oral gift of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not ter@@ at@@ ogenic . &quot;

&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at to take ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; for children ages six to eleven years , the dose is 2,5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or respectively . &quot;
&quot; in total , A@@ eri@@ us was examined in total eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies in patients who also had asthma patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by the change of symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to demonstrate that the body uses sy@@ rup , the solution to insert and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us have been taken to an average decrease of symptoms ( symp@@ tom points ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in Ur@@ g@@ aria the decrease of symptoms after six weeks treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; ap@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who may be sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission announced a approval for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for preventing symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are restricted experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be executed according to the date of disease and can be resumed after the sound of the symptoms and their re@@ appear again .
&quot; when persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days per week , and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the period of energy during the day of energy . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets not detected in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study the effect of alcohol is not reinforced during the current consumption of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the patients should be clari@@ fied however , that it may occur in very rare cases to drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to an impair@@ ment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events that reported more often than placebo was fatigue ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dri@@ p ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side of head@@ aches was treated at 5.@@ 9 % of the patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and at 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhibit@@ ing of the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ en as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the inhibit@@ ing of the expression of the Ad@@ ug@@ sion@@ ol@@ ec@@ ül@@ s P @-@ sel@@ ess on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in case of single dos@@ is@@ ine study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the ampli@@ fication of sub@@ jective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks that are connected to the flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the lens of symptoms such as ni@@ eses , secre@@ tion secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , comfor@@ ting and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the occurr@@ ence of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively decreased the burden of allergic allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , which exam@@ ines further forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is un@@ regarded as the underlying path@@ ology in the different forms are similar and chronic patients can be recruited . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ ity is a urs@@ or factor of all ur@@ inary illness , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin is also expected to improve the symptoms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria in other forms of the ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to Anti@@ hist@@ amine , was excluded from the study . &quot;
a improvement of the youth population by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in comparison to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wax significant as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis -@@ population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no access points for a clinical relevant Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , it was not identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ ing in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the medicine CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 is not in@@ hib@@ ited and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ case study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 7,5 mg , meals ( fat , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) are not included in the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin carried out in clinical trials , a comparable degree of exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the tox@@ icity fil@@ s of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security sp@@ har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repet@@ itive gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and the reproductive @-@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin cannot recognize any special dangers for humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independent of meals , for preventing the symptoms in allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the missing doctor should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are forward to support treatment of an infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical research and appropriate laboratory testing and skin studies should play a role in the diagnosis of diagnosis . &quot;
&quot; approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are restricted , and experienced a higher sub@@ sid@@ y load ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; safety from A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children between 2 and 11 years of age , which are affected by children , is identical with the children that metabolic normal . &quot;
&quot; this medication contains suc@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with genetic problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose @-@ int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ is@@ mal @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not be taken . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not detected in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were given in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol and alcohol is not reinforced with the performance of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up Group like the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and adolescents in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , at which up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who came for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily disaster dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study involving multi @-@ outlets in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents have no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; with a single @-@ daily dose of 7,5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies have no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came to an increase of alcohol @-@ induced efficiency , even to an increase of drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in the lens of symptoms such as ni@@ eses , secre@@ tion secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , comfor@@ ting and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall co@@ res of the questionnaire to the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ vit@@ is , A@@ eri@@ us tablets have been effectively eman@@ ated by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled studies in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted phen@@ otyp@@ s was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than Caucas@@ us ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , which are mainly metabolic . &quot;
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a season semi @-@ value of about 120 hours .
there are no access points for clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient Kum@@ ulation after a daily application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
&quot; 12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable to those of adults , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin si@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg . &quot;
&quot; however , it was not identified for the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible , so that inter@@ actions with other drugs cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up is available in type III @-@ brown bottles with child @-@ secure polypropylene connection cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;
&quot; equipped with rigid , transparent pol@@ ystyrene measuring sco@@ op , cali@@ br@@ ated with 2.5 ml and 5 ml or with a application injection for inser@@ tion of 2.5 ml and 5 ml ( only for the 150 ml bottle ) . &quot;
a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once taken once daily in the mouth to prevent symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ats will be taken into account without being damaged . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets not detected in which ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were used in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single @-@ dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well toler@@ ated ; this was documented by clinical analysis results , medical examinations , vit@@ al@@ marks and EC@@ G intervals . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day , no statistically significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dose of 5 mg , there was no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;

there are restricted experience from clinical trials for efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tablet will be taken , without being damaged . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness and reliability of A@@ eri@@ us 2,5 m@@ g. of processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been detected . &quot;
the overall rigi@@ dity of side effects between the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was immediately and with@@ drew not significantly from the patient &apos;s safety profile .

&quot; the safety of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in children between 2 and 11 years of age , fully metabolic , is identical with the children that metabolic normal . &quot;
&quot; this medication contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with genetic problems of a fru@@ ct@@ os@@ e- int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants aged 6 to 23 months the most common adverse events were reported to be more common than placebo , diarr@@ hea ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and insom@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
an additional study was observed in an additional dose of 2.5 mg Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution to take no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
&quot; at the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in child and adult population . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents have no increased incidence of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can also be dependent on the duration of symptoms as well as in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and &quot;

Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially distributed the Committee for Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) in June 2008 that the company takes its request to prevent A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ars H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect the flu virus caused by the strain ( Type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the Influ@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic that could protect a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ de@@ mic breaks out , when a new tribe of influenza virus appears , which can be easily spread from human beings , because people still have no immun@@ ity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects the parts of the influenza virus as &quot; body alien@@ d &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system later is able to form an contact with a Gri@@ pp@@ ev@@ irus this tri@@ bal . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes human body as a foreign @-@ strange ) , cleaned up and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
a inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this resulted in the scope of clinical data base for the assessment of safety of vacc@@ ines to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for prehistoric vacc@@ ines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical study and require further information about your treatment , please contact your doctor doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , the immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) caused the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can &apos;t swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not examined . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be negotiated when the doctor has tested , which has taken the an@@ tivir@@ al medicines at the patient , and the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood has judged that the virus is related to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily , which can be taken daily at 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ash@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ amount in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines .
&quot; but does not heal AIDS , however , the fo@@ aming of the immune system , thus allowing the development of AIDS linked infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 206 adults who had used earlier prot@@ agonist inhibit@@ or compared to other protests . &quot;
main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks under A@@ generic ase , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as under placebo , but A@@ generic was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the vir@@ us@@ burden , but with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , were only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adult who had been treated earlier with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four different prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of the viral load after four weeks after the patient who continued their previous prot@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , vomiting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic ase must not be applied in patients who may be over@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ generic ase must not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( an vegetable preparations for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are the same as A@@ pr@@ ase , and are being harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines in patients suffering from patients who are using ash@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis ( extinction of bone tissue ) or a immune re@@ activated syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the conclusion that the Benef@@ ic@@ ase Committee was reached in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drug treatment in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years , over four years . &quot;
&quot; in general , A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . however , the Committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination have not been detected . &quot;
&quot; under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was initially approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as at the time of approval from scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited issued an approval for the placing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children over 4 years . &quot;
usually A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boo@@ sters from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r should be carried out into consideration of the individual viral resistance and treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ ore@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ eli@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , higher doses of as@@ per ( 1200 mg twice daily ) will be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ ore@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ id@@ av@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r who should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic ase is not recommended for the use of children under 4 years , due to the lack of data on the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ genetic data , the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be contra@@ cted in patients with mild or moderate liver function in patients with severe liver function , it is counter@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ generic ase must not be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
&quot; herbal supplements , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated ) may not be applied due to risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect from Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r during taking am@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
the patients should be pointed out that ash@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to the healing of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treating A@@ generic ase prevents the risk of a transmission of HIV on others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are treated to chronic hepatitis B or C and are treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , an increased risk for heavy liver effects with potentially fatal results . &quot;
&quot; for the case of an equally an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including an chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function associated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in clinical practice according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of am@@ per@@ ase and c@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose co@@ sting , which is not recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , it is not recommended that the potential benefit of systemic co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the ad@@ ren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ generic and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ia including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available for determining the effectiveness concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have taken this medicine at the same time , ash@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma level of am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ id@@ av@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ eous symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the possible risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high pro@@ pane contents of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ cted in children under a age of four years and should be used with caution with certain other patient groups . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be set to duration 5 if the rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , was reported on the occurr@@ ence of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ glyc@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ her@@ ation of an existing diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , whose therapy medications were needed to be associated with the development of a type of diabetes mell@@ itus , or hyper@@ glyc@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders , associated . &quot;
&quot; for ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are reports about an increase of bleeding , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ ist infections develop , which leads to severe clinical conditions or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although an Multi@@ fact@@ orial en@@ ti@@ ology is adopted ( among them use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis have been reported in patients with advanced HIV @-@ illness and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates can &apos;t be given simultaneously with medication which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic b@@ case with c@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with medication whose active ingredients are predominantly associated with CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and associated with increased plasma level with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ pet@@ avi@@ r who can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can lead to a resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to explo@@ res the lowest plasma level by a dose of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently un@@ wanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ ated atum ) The serum levels of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations with the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient enters the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ ate@@ av@@ ir@@ ish mirror and , if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut . &quot;
a Dos@@ age custom@@ ization for one of the medicine is not necessary when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( see also E@@ ight ir@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max by contrast 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ using capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg were applied twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and dis@@ comfort of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was given .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a close surveillance , because the effectiveness and the integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , due to the ant@@ acids the component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
this is why there is no dose to dose with am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) .
the treatment with E@@ com@@ ir@@ ence in combination with am@@ id@@ av@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins were inhibit@@ or .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data can be dis@@ cour@@ aged that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pin possibly reduces the serum concentration of am@@ id@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this medication should be used simultaneously , caution is commanded , because Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din could be less effective because of the reduced and possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; if this medication should be used together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ id@@ av@@ r and c@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in resulted in an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in by 193 % and thus linked to a rise in ri@@ fl@@ ut@@ ations related side effects .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in combined with am@@ per@@ ase is to be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data are present . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic studies with ash@@ ore in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 2 ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ on@@ ren@@ ca@@ vi@@ r once a day .
&quot; other medicines being listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied together with am@@ per@@ ate , possibly with inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs , when they are applied in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ generic ase , because it can come to res@@ or@@ p@@ tive disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ va , which are known as enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ id@@ av@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of cal@@ ci@@ um@@ kan@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , rocky pin , ni@@ pp@@ pin , ni@@ pp@@ pin , N@@ amed pin , N@@ ood@@ pin , N@@ ood@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il , can be increased by Am@@ pet@@ avi@@ r 10 , elimin@@ ating the activity and tox@@ icity of this drug . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ion with as@@ gener@@ ase can increase considerably , and ampli@@ fy with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection side effects , including mort@@ ars , se@@ eding disorders and Pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily were given twice a day together with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by about 86 % ( 90 % -@@ con@@ fi@@ den@@ ces interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generic ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ids are not recommended , unless the potential benefit of treatment was the risk of systemic co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er shirts , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , which is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , distinctive increases of the plasma bar at the same administration of A@@ generic ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ m@@ asp@@ ar increases of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ er inhibit@@ or to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended using Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended a common monitoring of therapeutic concentrations up to stabili@@ zation of the mirror , as the plasma concentrations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and t@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the same gift of am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generic ase must not be applied together with oral in@@ gen@@ eous Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while using the same application of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
&quot; data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins , refer to a possible increase in Plas@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am plasma level by 3 to 4 @-@ fold . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ id@@ av@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on o@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ eous symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the due low reliability of historical buildings , there is currently no recommendation to adapt , as the am@@ ate@@ av@@ ir@@ - dose is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ on at the same time . &quot;
&quot; at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , together with A@@ generic ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of handling or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tiv@@ a is not pre@@ dict@@ able ; therefore alternative methods are recommended for the conception .
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous gift of A@@ generic ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medication may only be applied to the possible risks for the F@@ etus during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in the milk re@@ activated rats , Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ pet@@ avi@@ r is over to people in breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the in@@ fusion in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation in the u@@ terus until the end of the breast@@ feeding of 12 body weight , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight . &quot;
the further development of descendants including Fer@@ til@@ ism and Re@@ duction ability was not imp@@ aired by the administration of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r to the womb .
the im@@ pregn@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; most with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment related side effects were easy to moderate , stood early , and rarely led to treatment ab@@ rupt@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether they are related to HIV treatment or another at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the described side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not treated twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which have been used by the study period as well as in connection with study medication , and in more than 1 % of the patients were listed as well as under the treatment of surgery ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a distribution of body fat ( Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy ) with HIV patients , including a loss of body fat tissue , increased intra@@ ocular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hy of the breasts and dor@@ man@@ ic fat collection ( Sti@@ ern@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; not treated with 113 anti@@ retro@@ active people who had been treated with am@@ id@@ av@@ r in combination with Lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ ing ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) in combination with various N@@ RT@@ Is ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; skin rash were usually light up to moderately distinct , ery@@ them@@ atic or ma@@ st@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second consecutive week , without being canc@@ eled spontan@@ e@@ ously within two weeks , without the treatment with am@@ id@@ av@@ r . &quot;
&quot; cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ sis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory response can be developed to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day together with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were observed in patients that were treated with low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r , very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of super@@ vis@@ ation , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are required . &quot;

&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ id@@ av@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as peripher@@ al blood c@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the inhibit@@ ing of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans are not defined yet .
the treatment of anti @-@ previously untreated patients with the currently approved fossil co@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r doses have been detected - as with other p@@ avi@@ avi@@ r t@@ oo@@ ster treatment schem@@ atic - the mut@@ ations described only rarely .

&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ical analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , with which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance sample , which were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ on@@ co@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ically treated patients came to patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or mut@@ ations : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ Algorith@@ m defined as the presence of the Mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2a / C / F / W , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / W , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2A / C / F / W , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , and a reduced probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relev@@ ance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations , changes are subject to additional data , and it is recommended to attract the current inter@@ pret@@ ative systems for analysis of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; in combination with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations , investig@@ ational inter@@ pret@@ ative inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ pren@@ at@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; companies , diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to interpretation of a resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cruise resistance between Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ho@@ avi@@ r resist@@ ors , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viruses not previously treated patients , with a fossil amp@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ im@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ar@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ar@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , ar@@ ca@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; the vice versa , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ iness @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the early departure of a failed therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the following treatment . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ generic ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 600 mg twice daily ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) and a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the section A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ base shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the efficacy of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , ash@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously treated at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients included in the study included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
19 Based on these data should be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ ster &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , medium duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max by contrast 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake is affected , and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption influences . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can close to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r from the blood cycle to the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the plasma &apos;s total concentration in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ born am@@ id@@ av@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ ylo@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components of the free active components during the met@@ ady state concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;

&quot; the gift of ash@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ l@@ able than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar base . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the impact of ren@@ al function in elim@@ ination to the elim@@ ination of am@@ id@@ av@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should be low . &quot;
&quot; these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r pl@@ as@@ per , comparable to those who achieved healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ id@@ av@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily . &quot;

the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the o@@ cellular aden@@ ome and carcin@@ oma was not yet resolved and the relev@@ ance of this observed effects for humans is un@@ clear .
&quot; however , out of the present exposure data on humans , both clinical trials and therapeutic use , however , some evidence for the adoption of a clinical relev@@ ance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , which included bacteria &apos;s lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kern@@ els in rats and chromos@@ om@@ en@@ ab@@ err@@ ation@@ test to human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes were am@@ id@@ av@@ r neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored in clinical use by AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , in clinical trials , no significant liver tox@@ icity in patients were observed , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity at young , who were treated at a age of 4 days , showed both the controls and with am@@ id@@ av@@ r treated animals a high mortality . &quot;
&quot; however , in a systemic plasma @-@ exposure that was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and low @-@ level skel@@ eton changes have been observed on a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the increased addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ adding ) , higher doses of as@@ per ( 1200 mg twice daily ) will be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for ag@@ ore@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ id@@ av@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ end@@ avi@@ r who should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application should be contra@@ cted in patients with weak or mild liver function in patients with severe liver function , it is counter@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International standardi@@ zation ratio ) , methods are available for determining the effectiveness concentration . &quot;
as@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 when a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms are accompanied or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es are involved ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk for Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C from Am@@ pet@@ avi@@ r who can lead to an vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and can lead to a resistance development .
&quot; 508 % increases , for C@@ max by contrast 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ using capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ id@@ av@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ ca@@ vi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a close surveillance , because the effectiveness and the integrity of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ com@@ ir@@ ence in combination with am@@ id@@ av@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both proteins were inhibit@@ or .
&quot; if this medication should be used together , caution is offered ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring should be performed as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of am@@ id@@ av@@ r and c@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , Ri@@ y@@ ut@@ in combined with am@@ per@@ ase is to be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose of 31 , although no clinical data are present . &quot;

&quot; at the same gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , together with A@@ generic ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of handling or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg ) E@@ thin@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medication may only be applied to the possible risks of the potential for the F@@ öt@@ us during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study of pregnant rats , administered by the in@@ gement in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation in the u@@ terus until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed an decreased increase in the body weight during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the im@@ pregn@@ ation of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical studies in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
&quot; in case of super@@ vis@@ ation , the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ation ( see section 4.8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are required . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of am@@ id@@ av@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood c@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm at acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm at chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; the vice versa , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r reserves his activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ iness @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the receipt of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations to isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the therapy optimization should be considered to be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of &quot; un@@ geb@@ oo@@ red &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ born am@@ ylo@@ vi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components of free active components during the met@@ ady state concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

the bio@@ availability of Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % lower than one capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be able as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , with taking the solution to take part ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition , there must be no dose recommended dosage for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take and low do@@ si@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided with these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although a dose is not necessary for am@@ ate@@ avi@@ r not necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ cted for inclusion in patients with kidney disease ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ cted for children and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney disease . &quot;

treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long continued until all the visible F@@ eig@@ n of the Gen@@ ital@@ - or Peri@@ od range have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interru@@ ption in the above procedure should be weighed when intensive local inflammation appear ( see section 4.4 ) or if in the treatment range an infection is observed .
&quot; if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is left out , the patient should carry the cream , as soon as he noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; in a thin layer , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and to drive with f@@ eig@@ n infected skin zone until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
it should be carried out in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk of auto@@ immune disease risk .
it should be carried out in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ or gra@@ ft versus @-@ host@@ - reaction .
&quot; in other studies in which no daily Vor@@ h@@ auth@@ orization was carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one of the circumcision leading Stri@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which have a treatment necessary and / or to have a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions were gathered at the outcome of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water that require a emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly in connection to treatment with other cut@@ aneous formulation for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ n in the genital and peri@@ ority area , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of moisture reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown in this patient group in relation to the elim@@ ination of F@@ eig@@ n , however , having a lower effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips or the hair kit was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions take effect during the therapy or the responses form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s symptoms or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be evaluated after the treatment of treated skin around 12 weeks after the treatment of treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be moved to super@@ fi@@ ve@@ bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma other suitable treatment forms into consideration . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated B@@ CC@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicates that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy exists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ os on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or in the ears area within the lip@@ stick . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ic places outside the facial and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the fore@@ arms and hands support the efficacy in this use case , therefore a such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions take over the course of the therapy to intensity or go after finishing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause large dis@@ comfort , or very strong , treatment can be suspended for a few days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 acts are reported to have a lower full healing rate of patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od should be applied with caution when patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / f@@ öt@@ ale development , the de@@ binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ painted top@@ ical application , the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) has been achieved , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most common shared and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with three @-@ time treatment were local reactions to the treatment of F@@ eig@@ n ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and possibly , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to side effects , complaints with an incidence of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; the basis of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated Bas@@ ali@@ om @-@ patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are listed below . &quot;
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in relation to this studies were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot;
side effects shown by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis were listed below .
&quot; according to the audit plan , the evaluation of clinical evidence shows that it often occur in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) and oil ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the audit plan , the evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in these studies using I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is very common to severe ery@@ issues ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe de@@ duction ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the acci@@ dental recording of 200 m@@ g. I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gies and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clinical serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , was norm@@ alized in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic study , according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increasing the systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected . &quot;
&quot; in 3 appro@@ vals Phase 3 efficacy studies , the effectiveness in relation to a complete healing of the F@@ eig@@ n treatment with an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo @-@ treatment is superior . &quot;
&quot; in a total of 60 % of patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients , the f@@ eig@@ ns were completely destroyed ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo @-@ treated patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
full allocation could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 patients with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed individual primary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled study study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically exposed , and this also remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during three @-@ week application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week period of treatment , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , discre@@ et , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acc@@ u@@ sions within a related 25 c@@ m2 of treatment than on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the income data from two combined observation studies show patients with clinical trials after one or two treatment periods a recur@@ ren@@ al rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indication of statements , brie@@ f@@ ical ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , usually not examined and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was investigated in four randomised , double @-@ blind studies in children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks ) .
&quot; a minimum systemic recording of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application , during 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml during the use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated half @-@ time time was about 10 times higher than the 2@@ hour semi @-@ este@@ em after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended re@@ ten@@ tion of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute corne@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on the paint tox@@ icity at the rat brought doses of 0.5 and 2,5 mg / kg KG on significantly lower body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a study conducted for four months showed no similar effects on the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on cardi@@ ogen@@ icity in mice near mice at three days per week does not induced tum@@ ors at the application site .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ed , is a risk of human exposure to people due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice , which was treated with the real @-@ free cream , previously and in larger number than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people , even if these same symptoms do you like you . − If one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you notice side effects that are not listed in this manual information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ n ( Cond@@ yl@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the gen@@ itals of the gen@@ itali@@ a ( gender organs ) and the An@@ us ( after ) created the superf@@ icial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma That is often a common , slow growing shape of skin cancer with very low probability of the spread on other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains un@@ treated , it can lead to de@@ positions , especially in the face - therefore it is important . &quot;
ac@@ coun@@ ties are rough areas of the skin that occur in people during their previous life much of the sun radiation .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be applied for flat @-@ tin@@ ned ker@@ at@@ os in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the best suitable treatment .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body @-@ own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superf@@ icial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the acute ker@@ at@@ osis or the infection with F@@ eig@@ n responsible virus . &quot;
&quot; O If you have used earlier Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other , similar preparations , please inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a Cream when you have problems with your immune system . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nose mu@@ cos@@ a . &quot;

&quot; once the reactions are removed , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they don &apos;t have a normal blood pattern . &quot;
&quot; when this daily cleaning is not performed under the fores@@ kin , it can be reck@@ oned with increased occurr@@ ence of fores@@ kin , ferti@@ liz@@ ers , skin , or difficulty in the return of the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; turn Al@@ dar@@ a Cream not in the U@@ re@@ th@@ ra ( ure@@ th@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the Zer@@ vi@@ x ( cervical ) or within the An@@ us ( after ) . &quot;
&quot; taking other medicines serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle . &quot;
if you have intercourse during the infection with F@@ eig@@ n in the genital area intercourse is the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after intercourse ( not before ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you apply other medicines or recently used recently , even if it is not prescription drug . &quot;
&quot; quiet your infant during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , not known if I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od occurs in the breast milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of treatment are covered with f@@ eig@@ n , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and acute ker@@ at@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; wear a thin layer al@@ dar@@ a cream on the clean , dry skin with the f@@ eig@@ n up and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully covered . &quot;
men with f@@ eig@@ n under the fores@@ kin have to withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area below ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before the application of Al@@ dar@@ a Cream ? &quot; ) .
please speak with your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks , 5 days a week after a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream , have a sufficient amount of al@@ dar@@ a cream to cover the affected area and 1 cm around the area . &quot;

inform your doctor / your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist / your pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly on the treatment with al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap , and your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; a low number of blood cells can make you more pr@@ one for infections ; it can work with you faster a blue spot , or it can cause loss . &quot;
&quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists , if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you are aware of the side effects that are not specified in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can find it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas where you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually , there are more lighter skin reactions within a period of approximately 2 weeks after finishing the treatment . &quot;
&quot; sometimes some patient changes on the application location ( wound secre@@ tions , inflammation , swelling , skin destruction , bladder , der@@ mat@@ itis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; sometimes some patients suffer from changes in the application place ( blu@@ ff@@ ing , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling or un@@ eas@@ iness ) , inflammation of the eyel@@ ids , cervical pain , diarr@@ hea , acute pain , muscle pain , fever , weakness , weakness or shi@@ vering . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to treat patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ch ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or ner@@ ves in connection ) .
&quot; this means certain substances ( Gly@@ os@@ amin@@ o@@ gly@@ kan@@ e , G@@ ags ) will not be dismant@@ led , thus in most organs in the body and they are ashamed . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neurolog@@ ical symptoms of M@@ PS I can appear : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements are harder , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye disease . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other genetic metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital , or a clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and the patients need appropriate drugs to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness was measured ( by using its effect in terms of reducing the g@@ ag concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ ag concentrations in urine around 60 % , and half of the treated children had a normal liver at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ act pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat este@@ em , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion interface . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react strongly to patients who react strongly ( allergic ) on lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or another components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , not applied . &quot;
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be noti@@ fied every year for all new information that may be known , check this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients who have Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , see reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. &quot;
&quot; lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ onic id@@ ase , and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ asis , ov@@ stock of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ ch ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neurolog@@ ical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other genetic metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient is able to increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency was not determined ; and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme can be recommended .
&quot; with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , patients can develop in@@ fusion reactions that are defined as any related side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , these patients should continue to be monitored also in a reasonable clinical environment , and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be available in an appropriate clinical environment in the revival facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion reaction , must be treated with caution with caution ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the recovery of the treatment after a longer interru@@ ption , it must be c@@ auti@@ ous because of the theore@@ tically increased risk reaction after a interru@@ ption of treatment . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ lock ) , to minim@@ ize the potential of in@@ fusion reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate , which occurred the reaction . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction must be stopped , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are taken to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ fusion can be taken with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate on 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , which occurred the reaction . &quot;
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate of 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or pro@@ c@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase about breast milk over the breast milk , is recommended to breast@@ feeding during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; adverse reactions were identified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed at 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) . &quot;
un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the phase 3 study and of its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older in the following table are often observed ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , there were also severe reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , breathing and visual acu@@ ity ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ wanted drug inter@@ actions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe de@@ structive form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment to a nap@@ onic version , with the patients aged under 5 years with a heavier version of the patients ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to an early departure from the study ) were det@@ ectable antibodies at 13 / 45 patients with radio@@ immun@@ op@@ itors ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay , among them 3 patients , with whom it never came to ser@@ oc@@ on@@ version . &quot;
&quot; patients with lack of low @-@ body levels have a robust reduction in the g@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n , while in patients with high antibody tit@@ ers a variable reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n was determined . &quot;
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ gin@@ ally up to low neutr@@ alis@@ ative effect on enzy@@ matic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of g@@ ag in Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of Anti@@ bodies seemed not in connection with the incidence of adverse medicine actions , even when the occurr@@ ence of undes@@ ired drug actions typically fell together with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the grounds for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hy@@ d@@ roly@@ sis of the acute sub@@ strate and preventing another accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly taken from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ i @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me have been examined in a randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , which was applied to the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients in the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient had the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recruited if they had an ongoing exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the estimated value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were recruited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the placebo group an improvement of lung function and the capacity that is represented in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining the effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as follows the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the current percentage of FE@@ V is not significantly significantly and the absolute lung volumes increased significantly more proportional to the body size of the children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a hepat@@ atomic fact , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was established , which remained constant at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; in regard to the hetero@@ gen@@ eous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients who had taken into account , clin@@ ically significant changes in five efficacy ( 58 % ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old Phase 2 study was conducted in which primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined at 20 patients who were at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the heavy fraction form and 4 with the middle version ) .
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle distances form only limited , or even no progress in cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations were used to generate co@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata to the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks , patients who have difficulty with weekly In@@ fu@@ sions can represent an represented alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug may be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic profile of patients aged under 5 years was similar to those in elderly and less severe patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( a different medicines for cancer ) in patients who can not be removed ( medicines for cancer ) , or &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant cancer ) , or &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ial cells ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who have previously not been treated , in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who have previously applied other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as a sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce adverse events , patients during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin C ) and absorb vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; when A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , before or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition , an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent liquid man@@ ners ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood is changed , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be applied , ab@@ orted , or reduce the dose . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed slow@@ ed down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in cancer cells is lighter than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentrations of the active form of medication and a longer mode of time in cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ ome , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were treated in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local or metastatic disease which had previously been treated with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( a different medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy alone , the average survival compared with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,3 months compared with 7.9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies patients , however , patients did not attack the epi@@ thel@@ ium cells , with the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the Commission of Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. a approval for placing A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; with 4,2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride injec@@ tions ( 9 mg / ml ) , each bottle of sodium chloride ( 9 mg / ml ) must be dis@@ solves into a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.9 % sodium chloride injec@@ tions ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in to first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic @-@ small @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ tr@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in two @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small @-@ cell carcin@@ oma except for excessive epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate - In@@ fusion on the first day every 21 @-@ day treatment course .
in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F was administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of folic acid have to be taken and intake must be continued during the entire treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ate dose . &quot;
patients also have to receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third upgrade cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re , a complete blood pattern should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the al@@ physical phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should amount to 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose inspection will take place under review - the N@@ adi@@ rs of blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; according to recovery , the patients must be treated according to tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are treated for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria comply with the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient must pay the value before treatment . &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be broken when in patients after 2 dos@@ is@@ c@@ tional tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ atology tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ atology tox@@ icity ( 3 or 4 ) occurs at the occurr@@ ence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical trials does not have a reference to patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data regarding the un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dose adap@@ t@@ ages needed to go out for all patients recommended Dos@@ age custom@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
the data in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin cle@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with liver function applications were evaluated by the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ ions of &gt; the upper limit value ( in terms of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored in terms of the bone @-@ market , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ rop@@ hil@@ ation count again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ tes count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of absolute neutral number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ atology tox@@ icity , as they were observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of the degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ otic tox@@ icity , as neutr@@ rop@@ enia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutr@@ rop@@ enia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ rop@@ enia and infection was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ treated patients need to be used to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the same intake of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ IDS ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ization ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients who are intended for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , the intake of N@@ SA@@ IDS must be avoided with a long semi @-@ value for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , existing high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid collection in trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the ergonom@@ ics before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment can be weighed . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cr@@ un@@ rov@@ ular events were reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ed life di@@ mm@@ ers ( except yellow fever , this in@@ oc@@ ulation is contra@@ cted ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible Schä@@ di@@ - to reproductive capability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re , men should be pointed out before the treatment - G@@ inn to get advice regarding sperm con@@ formity . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti @-@ logi@@ st@@ ika ( N@@ SA@@ IDS , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) , and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) . &quot;
therefore be careful when in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDS or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - ic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and minim@@ ization ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; because there is no data regarding the interpre@@ ter than with N@@ SA@@ IDS , as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of barley status during the disease and the possibility of interaction between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ces .
there are no data for using P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed at pregnant women but as with an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected during an application in pregnancy severe birth defects .
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessary , demanding and after careful use of commercial use for the mother and risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible shepherd of reproductive @-@ remedi@@ es , men should be pointed out before the start of the treatment , counsel@@ ing on sperm cells . &quot;
it is not known if P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to the breast milk and un@@ wanted effects in the gest@@ ill@@ ful infants cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and gravity of adverse adverse effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ om and random@@ ized c@@ is@@ plat@@ in and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with mes@@ m@@ i@@ om , random@@ ized C@@ is@@ plat@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

clinical relevant CT@@ C tox@@ ic@@ ities that were reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients were random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed associated with su@@ pre@@ vent@@ ri@@ cular arr@@ hyth@@ mia .
&quot; the clinical relevant laboratory tox@@ icity degree 3 and 4 was similar to the consolidated results of three single P@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ mon@@ otherap@@ eutic study ( n = 164 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Al@@ an@@ int@@ ran@@ in@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared with 1.9 % ) . &quot;
&quot; these sub@@ strate are likely to lead to differences in patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies were both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and significantly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or ab@@ nor@@ ms output values of liver function tests . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received examination in treatment arms ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statistically significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ othel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms are characterized by an improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function throughout time in control .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , randomised , open Phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C after previous chemotherapy occupied a median survival of 8.3 months with AL@@ IM@@ TA patients ( intensity to Tre@@ at Population n = 283 ) and treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the treatment effect fell to favor of AL@@ IM@@ TA with NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with NS@@ CL@@ C ( n = 3@@ 99 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of an separately randomised controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) are similar to doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analysis of IT@@ T population and support non @-@ sub @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AL@@ IM@@ TA C@@ is@@ plat@@ in combination with the gem@@ cit@@ abine in combination with the gem@@ cit@@ abine .

&quot; if you are taking the capsule in conjunction with a meal , which contains too much fat , risk @-@ related accompanying expression ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , you start in front of the first capsule holder with a cal@@ ori@@ en- and fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; nutritional buttons are effective , as you can get started at any time you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to ensure your target weight , you should set two daily objectives in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; • feed the fatty acid , to reduce the probability of nutrition @-@ related accompanying expression ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more , before you start taking the capsules . &quot;
remember in advance to ask your doctor if you are not used physical activity . • Stay during intake and after the termination of all@@ i physically active .
&quot; • all@@ i must not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can find no reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; under circumstances , you must end the intake of all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about to determine the nutrition only and to return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; • If less than one hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule . &quot;
bl@@ ings with and without power outlet , sudden , or more increased chair ( see section 1 ) are attributable to the effectiveness mechanism ( see section 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; severe allergic reactions • Seri@@ ous allergic reactions do recognize you in the following changes : severe breath of breathing , wel@@ ders , rash , it@@ ching , swelling , circul@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; 29 Very frequent side effects These can be taken at more than 1 out of 10 people who may take all@@ i , occur . • Bl@@ aps ( Flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without power outlet • Wei@@ cher chair information call your doctor or pharmac@@ ists , if one of these side effects are reinforced or significantly imp@@ aired . &quot;

effects on blood tests It is not known as frequently these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enzy@@ matic • effects on blood cl@@ ots in patients suffering from War@@ far@@ in or other bleeding ( anti@@ co@@ agu@@ ing ) medicines .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ists if one of the listed side effects are significantly imp@@ aired or you are aware of the side effects that are not specified in this manual information .
the most common side effects depend on the mode of capsules together and thus created that the fat is cut out of the body .
&quot; normally , these side effects occur usually within the first weeks after treatment of treatment , as you may not have reduced the fat content in diet perhaps not consistently reduced . &quot;
&quot; with the following rules you can learn to minim@@ ize the nutrition @-@ related accompanying book : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite food and over the size of the portions , which you usually take to yourself . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you can sur@@ pass your fat limit . • Do your recommended grease amount evenly to everyday meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take care of them in the form of a low @-@ rich central court or of a durable night @-@ to @-@ weight , how to control them in the form of a low @-@ rich central court or of a lasting night@@ mare . • The most people in those accompanying them will learn to control these with the time by adjust@@ ing their nutrition . &quot;
• Medic@@ ines for children un@@ accessible . • You must not apply all@@ i after the specified date of the exp@@ ir@@ ation date . • The bottle is closed to keep the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed container with Si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel which serve the capsules dry .
if you do not swal@@ low this in any case . • You can lead your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) with itself which is attached to this package .

&quot; if you take the same amount of fat , how far , can this mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended grease supply , you can reduce the weight loss and reduce the probability for nutrition @-@ related accompanying companion . • You should try to gradually increase and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 These dimin@@ ished cal@@ orie intake , it should enable you to gradually lose weight approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight , without fruit and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher is your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn daily 150 kcal a day , for example through 3 km walk , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to put realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat targets and maintain this too . • It makes sense to move with data to cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more , before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the all@@ i program for the support of weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan , and a large number of additional information materials that can help to feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fet@@ tre@@ du@@ es to feed and be physically active . &quot;

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting ( like C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ) , as well as chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting ( like Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ lat@@ in ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( an medicines that can be used as anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended because the effects in this age group is not enough information .
&quot; this means that the active ingredient prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ ot@@ onin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three major studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; when chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting , 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vomiting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting , 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi were not vomiting in 24 hours after the chemotherapy alone ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron in patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; with Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a approval for the placing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting , due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderate chemotherapy due to cancer disease . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on prevention of nausea and vomiting , which is induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one before the chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ o@@ ic ob@@ stru@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is given to the same gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medication that length@@ ens the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T@@ - interval is length@@ ened or those of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics gift , Alo@@ xi should neither be used to prevent nausea and vomiting for the treatment of nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; in the clinical trials , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron developed non @-@ tum@@ ours activity of the five studied chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ static concentration of Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ am@@ ids , an CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic analysis , CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 In@@ hibit@@ ors ( D@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ din , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ en@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied when pregnant doctor should be considered necessary . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed adverse events ( total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , headache ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ jec@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ist reactions and reactions to the administration location ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar types of adverse events showed un@@ wanted events such as in the other dos@@ ing groups ; there were no dose @-@ effectiveness relations . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out , due to the large distribution volume , but is probably not an effective therapy in a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ based chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) that was given to day 1 without D@@ exam@@ eth@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly powerful chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients receiving 32 mg On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron , which were given to day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summar@@ ized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters were comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ als and leng@@ then the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the target of 221 healthy volunteers from the study was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of existing Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In accordance with intraven@@ ous gift , a slow elim@@ ination of plasma concentration follows a slow elim@@ ination from the body with an average termin@@ al half time of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally generally propor@@ tionally proportional in total dos@@ is@@ range of 0.@@ 3- 90 g / kg .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg each second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean average ( ± SD ) was measured at 11 ± 34 % in diameter of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , the value of a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached a total of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was measured after one single @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after a single occupancy of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % are eliminated about the kidneys , and some 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ites , which are in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies for metabol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 have been involved in a lower size , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elim@@ ination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bolt projection , the total body weight of 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; in fact , patients with severe liver function is increased in patients with severe liver function and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , a reduction of dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate above the maximum human@@ oid exposure , which indicates a low relev@@ ance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies indicate that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers , which can be involved in vent@@ ri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose de@@ pressed in about the 30@@ fold of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , who have been given daily for two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ op@@ las@@ m ( in thy@@ roid , pan@@ cre@@ as , non @-@ ni@@ er@@ en@@ mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and because Alo@@ xi is intended for a one @-@ time application , the relev@@ ance of these results are assessed as for humans . &quot;
&quot; the holder of this auth@@ orization must be informed by the European Commission to inform the plans of the regulatory authorities in the framework of this decision . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expert in which the approval of the regulatory approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was intended to be recommended by Alp@@ he@@ on 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that alp@@ he@@ on an organic medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A should be similar to the same phar@@ ma @-@ effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in case of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , liver tissue damage points , also the values of the liver enzyme Al@@ an@@ dic amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by an yeast produced , into which a gene ( DNA ) was taken into the formation of the effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on laid data on the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition , and purity of the drug , mode of efficiency , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study enrolled in patients with Hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the effectiveness of the reference rate . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks , as well as 6 months after setting the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ pin htt@@ p : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © EMEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non @-@ generation of the EMEA . what were the greatest concerns to disp@@ atch the CH@@ MP approval ?
&quot; furthermore , concerns about stability of the active ingredient and to marketing drugs have not been expressed . &quot;
the number of patients with hepatitis C based on the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical trial .
&quot; after setting the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease increased in more patients than at the reference rate . in addition , Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test in the study was to test the question of how far the medication forms a immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a cr@@ iti@@ ation of skin infection ) and small in@@ infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections which were demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resi@@ sten@@ te Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because Alar@@ go does not work against this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the surface area should not be more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient is not speaking after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient and investigate alternative treatments in consideration . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacterial infection which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the main Indi@@ c@@ ator of efficacy was in all five studies of patients , whose infection was after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected skin , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar response rates : when the results of both studies were gathered together at Hau@@ tw@@ ain , about 90 % of the patients from both groups were on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of Ab@@ sz@@ essen ( filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infection , which have been demonstr@@ ably caused by M@@ RSA , is not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation on the contractor .
&quot; the conclusion of Human Rights Committee ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go was over the short @-@ term treatment of superf@@ icial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small Laz@@ er@@ ations , fe@@ aring or paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the passenger transportation of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the patients , where there is no improvement within two to three days , should still be examined and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of a sen@@ sibility or severe local irrit@@ ation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , treatment should be broken off , the sal@@ be carefully caught and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be applied to the treatment of infections where M@@ RSA is known as path@@ ogen or susp@@ ects ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials with secondary infected wounds , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin , Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) were un@@ sufficient . &quot;
an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 day treatment is no improvement or deteri@@ oration of the infected spot .
the effect of simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not investigated and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations that have been achieved by the people after top@@ ical application , a clin@@ ically important inhibit@@ ing in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure after top@@ ical application in patients , Dos@@ age adjustments are not required if the top@@ ical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction icity of oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in terms of effects on the birth and the f@@ öt@@ ale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to the gift of an systemic antibiot@@ ic .
&quot; in the decision whether the breast@@ feeding is continued / ended , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be terminated / ended , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding of the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infections , which Al@@ tar@@ go was used , the most commonly reported side effect of irrit@@ ation at the administration location which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is insulated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ anus ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a particular binding unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes that diff@@ ers from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ ag@@ gregate anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the Bin@@ ding station ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ alen P @-@ Bin@@ ding station and the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ring centre is located .
&quot; through binding on this binding station in@@ hibit P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ transfer , block partly P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of local prevalence of resistance to ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some inf@@ lic@@ tions , should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; no differences in in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ appe@@ aling to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was opened daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion daily for up to 7 days . &quot;

the sampling took place in the days 3 or 4 in adult patients each before the medi@@ ation and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systematic recording of the people after top@@ ical use of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / ml ) 660 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;

&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used for protection against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases , which affect the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as part of one of two doses existing vacc@@ inations , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection , which can be carried out from two doses existing vacc@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; if a request for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work in keeping the immune system ( the natural defense of the body ) , as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens than &quot; foreign &quot; and created antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the V@@ rix adult vaccine since 1996 , and has been approved by Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used for protection against the same disease , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults and Twin@@ rix Children are administered as part of one of three doses existing vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; because ambient and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that are used by Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults also as a proof of the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the main Indi@@ c@@ ator for efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children , which had developed a month after the last injection , a protective anti @-@ physical concentration . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix led between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection to develop antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a hex@@ agon and a 12 month distance between injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccination doses ) are scal@@ p , appetite , pain at the injection station , redness , Mat@@ ter@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix may not react to the active ingredients ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Biolog@@ icals , which represents an auth@@ orization of the Ambi@@ rix in the entire &quot;
&quot; the standard dim@@ mer plan for the Grun@@ dig with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , with the first dose on the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a dri@@ zzle is desired for Hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination sim@@ pl@@ ant . &quot;
the anti @-@ Hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) anti @-@ Hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ bs@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ant vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not totally secured , whether immun@@ og@@ ents are addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - in@@ oc@@ ulation , they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory as they may be protected by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injection materials , for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic response to the gift of vacc@@ ines appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring will always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if an faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standard di@@ dim@@ mer scheme is recommended that the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of hem@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies , so in these cases the gift can be required for additional vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ lication result , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie or blood cl@@ amping disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be in@@ jected sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , as it can occur in these cases following in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , ac@@ ell@@ ul@@ al per@@ t@@ uss@@ ani ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ um@@ m@@ um@@ us vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from immune soup or patients with immun@@ o@@ deficiency , there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , sailors , gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable with the frequency which was observed in previous Thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ inated vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to the 3 @-@ digit combination @-@ material . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher Frequ@@ ency of Pain and Mat@@ ter at a calculation base per vaccination dose ambient , but not based on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination @-@ material . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects were given to the Ambi@@ rix , over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects that were vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ volume combination sim@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ter@@ ity was comparable high ( i.e. above the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of the subjects that were compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects that received the 3 @-@ doses combination sim@@ ulations ) . &quot;
the incidence of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and mat@@ ures was low and comparable to the combination of the combination @-@ up material with the 3 @-@ doses vaccine has been observed .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurr@@ ence of local inter@@ actions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the pre @-@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6- to 11@@ - year old , however , a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at injection ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported above heavy side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with ambient temperature , with 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated Hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B@@ - surface an@@ tigen , was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies that were carried out at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the ser@@ ok@@ on@@ ization rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were performed one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 months ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the basis rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 months ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a similar study , which was carried out in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combinations with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 289 persons whose immun@@ o@@ ogen@@ icity , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher compared to Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 on the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ material significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune answer , which have been achieved in a clinical compar@@ ative study of 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis C virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; for people who were aged between 12 and 15 years old , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immun@@ isation with ambient temperature in the 0 @-@ 6 months . &quot;
&quot; the immun@@ o@@ gens in this study observed immun@@ o@@ gens against both anti@@ gens , consisting of a combination of 3 doses , consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated he@@ at@@ it@@ is@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study in 12@@ - up to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be comparable to immun@@ isation in 0 @-@ 6 months of vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of ambient temperature in the second year is at the same time as a combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ ther@@ - , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mascot @-@ m@@ öt@@ t@@ ines ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined masks @-@ m@@ rub@@ ella vaccine it was sufficient for all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical trial , which was performed with 3 doses of current formulation of current formulation , showed similar to the current formulation of similar Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and Ser@@ oc@@ on version as for the previous formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ance on any eye particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by vir@@ us@@ u@@ rous food and drinks , but can also be transferred through other ways , such as by bathing in water contam@@ inated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly require stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot protect themselves from an infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
&quot; if you are infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , if you are infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus ( although you will not feel any un@@ comfortable or ill / her child ) may not prevent a disease . &quot;
&quot; protection against other infections caused by the liver damage or symptoms , which are similar to the hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; • If you have an allergic reaction to ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction can cause an allergic reaction to hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you have an allergic reaction to hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you have an allergic reaction to hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the prior appointment of the second vaccine dose ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis @-@ A@@ - / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of hepatitis B virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) .
the second vaccine dose of this vacc@@ ines with reduced salary is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you a vaccine protection before completion of the vaccination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is in@@ jected with people who are in@@ jected to severe blood cl@@ ots , among the skin and not in muscle disorders . if you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / its body &apos;s own defense / or when you / your child are under@@ going on a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these people can &apos;t be sufficient , so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is . &quot;
&quot; 21 If you have taken your doctor if you have any other medicines , if you have been vacc@@ inated or if you have been vacc@@ inated or if you have been vacc@@ inated or if you have been vacc@@ inated or Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) , or if you have been planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and possible different lim@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix are given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of Imm@@ ung@@ lob@@ ul@@ inen , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix Swan or breast@@ feeding women are not administered , except it is urg@@ ently needed to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already revealed an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; other side effects , the days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or in@@ im@@ itation against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rarely ( less than 1 case per 10,000 im@@ im@@ ed doses ) are reported : &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packages to 50 without need@@ les available .
&quot; based on the data that have been announced since issu@@ ance of the first approval for the domestic product , the CH@@ MP entered the opinion that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for ambi@@ ance remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix was only brought into a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medication is limited to low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients at the age of more than one month with a complete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ium is divided into several single boxes for meals - split , mixed with food mixed or over a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the stomach @-@ leading hose ) or a Nas@@ ens@@ onde ( through the nose in the gast@@ ro @-@ leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; there was no compar@@ ative study , since ammon@@ ium has not been compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a spot@@ light medicine , i.e. without drug ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also cause loss of loss , loss of acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid problems , stomach pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the conclusion that ammon@@ aps in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle , ammon@@ ium has effectively prevented high ammon@@ ium values . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium has been approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because of the disease the disease at the time of approval only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
the use is inde@@ xed in all patients with a full enzyme ( within the first 28 Living age ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ proof form ( in@@ cum@@ bent enzyme , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first lifetime ) there is an indication of the use of hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account of protein toler@@ ance and the development of daily protein intake of the patient . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
patients who suffer from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
patients with an arg@@ in@@ os@@ uc@@ cin@@ at@@ oplast@@ y deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0,4 @-@ 0.7 g / kg / day or 8,8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS pills may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as a risk for the emergence of Ec@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets are not immediately arrive in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used in patients with consistent heart failure or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium re@@ ten@@ tion and oil formation only with caution . &quot;
&quot; since metabol@@ isation and loss of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied in patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in regards to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ cted ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ etic to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ ing of neur@@ onal deteri@@ oration and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve damage in the brain and thereby a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be detected if phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is out of the people in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ cted during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one undes@@ ired event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic rate inhibit@@ or , severe hypo@@ aller@@ mia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ do@@ zation occurred during a 5 month old small child with an acci@@ dental dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate containing an intraven@@ ous dos@@ ing of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ lim@@ it@@ ory neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity showed .
phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate is an metabolic active connection with glut@@ amine with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine faced by the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ omet@@ ri@@ cally seen phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both joints contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
&quot; 5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle may be accepted , that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can be produced between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is started immediately to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
the progn@@ osis of the early symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ lic@@ ated and the disease led even in treating Per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alog@@ a within the first life year of death .
&quot; through hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen oxide ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ al ( however , within the first lifestyle ) disease in 80 % . &quot;
&quot; patients whose disease was diagnosed with pregnancy in the course of pregnancy and the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was diagnosed with many spiritual disabilities or other neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ proof form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ es form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy re@@ treated and afterwards permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; existing neurolog@@ ical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neurolog@@ ical state may occur . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate , which is produced in liver and kidney enzy@@ matic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined according to a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in poor healthy adults and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis according to single reproduction and repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metast@@ asis was also examined in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous gift of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking the measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycles or hem@@ og@@ lob@@ bin@@ aries , after various doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate was det@@ ectable in plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with cir@@ rh@@ osis of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is cut off within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had been treated with toxic and non toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral dos@@ ing an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is given either oral ( babies and children , who can &apos;t swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ y or a Nas@@ en@@ onde . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , acidity and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with a body weight over 20 kg , and with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( particularly bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ eration in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
patients who suffer from an early lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ synthetic or Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ ny bam@@ yl@@ ase is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day required .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when R@@ atten@@ dees were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate ( an active met@@ abo@@ und of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyr@@ am@@ ids of the brain rin@@ de . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported from an 18 year @-@ old an@@ ore@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic rate inhibit@@ or , severe hypo@@ aller@@ mia , P@@ anz@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ie , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea is comparable ( both joints contain 2 nitrogen oxide ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess weight
on the basis of research on the de@@ position of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ure@@ tic cycle may be accepted that each gram in@@ treated sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen are produced .

&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in granite form , 15 minutes after taking the measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can store the final product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; at this incident , the small measuring sco@@ op 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring sco@@ op 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication about a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; patients with these rare diseases are missing certain liver enzymes , so that it can not separate the nit@@ rate of waste products that can be obtained after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are examined laboratory studies , you must use the physician that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate may affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;

&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example , in un@@ stable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest basket with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart rate ) without &quot; St@@ - lifting &quot; ( an abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ac grams or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; an@@ gi@@ ox is used for preventing blood cl@@ ots in patients who continue to under@@ go a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with att@@ ina or heart failure to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; nearly 14 000 patients participated in the main study about the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ et@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination line with Hep@@ arin ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , the patient was frequently used a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a lock ) , and they received additional medicines for preventing blood cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xim@@ ab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; at the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - during prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox@@ ical must not be applied in patients , possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other mil@@ ud@@ ine or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied to patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; at the end , the Committee on Human Rights ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is a substitute for Hep@@ arin treatment during a PCI . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( inst@@ ab@@ ile anxiety ) ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) , if an early intervention is provided . &quot;
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt load of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PCI in another row , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h should be increased . &quot;
&quot; according to the PCI requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be included for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; directly before the procedure , a load of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and one of them directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value is shortened ( ACT after 5 minutes ) , it should be shortened below 225 seconds , should be a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully administered before use and administered by the Bol@@ us@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney applications ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which can be subjected to a PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be enough and re @-@ check the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that were included in the approval , the ACT lay 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
&quot; 3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) , an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ cted ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be conducted 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous Hep@@ arin or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ arin .
&quot; • known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine , active blood pressure or higher blood risk . • severe kidney disease and sub@@ acute bacterial En@@ do@@ car@@ dit@@ is . • heavy kidney shafts ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients &quot;
&quot; during the treatment , patients are carefully controlled in terms of symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even if in PCI @-@ patients appear under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most bleeding in arter@@ ial pun@@ cture , patients who under@@ go per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle all bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R advertising ( International standardi@@ zation ratio ) should be moved to ensure that the value of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be achieved before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the effectiveness of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants ) , this active ingredients may increase blood risk . &quot;

both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin was more common in women and patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i measures for heavy bleeding such as in the footsteps of Table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding emerged under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in alone significantly less than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ expression plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- inhibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY severe bleeding was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ ocular , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 4 g / dl without obvious blood vessel , reproduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ b@@ bin@@ s by ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known blood vessel , re@@ operation due to a bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;

&quot; the following data on side effects are based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients , which were subjected to a PCI . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients treated with Hep@@ arin was more common in women and patients over 65 years more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding emerged under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the comparison group among Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in Table 6 . &quot;
in case of super@@ vis@@ ation the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ ine is immediately breaking down and the patient is eng@@ aging with regard to signs of bleeding .
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ der , which is both in the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the Ani@@ on@@ en@@ binary region of Th@@ rom@@ bin , regardless of whether th@@ rom@@ bin is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the bin@@ der of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in to Th@@ rom@@ bin , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ rom@@ bin s@@ nap up the bin@@ der of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , making the function of the active centre of Th@@ rom@@ bin re@@ generates . &quot;

&quot; if the patient was performed in a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be increased and in@@ fusion for the duration of the input to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study was administered un@@ fra@@ ction@@ ated Hep@@ arin or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ cs ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lift ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) .

&quot; in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin @-@ l@@ is@@ per . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra in comparison to 0.@@ 30 % in human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra should not be applied to patients who are possibly sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can operate on blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission announced the European Commission of San@@ of@@ i @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Germany GmbH to provide an auth@@ orization of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdominal ceiling or the delta angle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdominal muscles .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of effectiveness , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc delay , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can withdraw a change of insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 An in@@ adequate dos@@ ing or demol@@ ition of a treatment , in particular in patients with an insulin @-@ dependent diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ glyc@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ dic@@ tive c@@ eto@@ azi@@ or ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
the change@@ over of a patient on another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under str@@ ingent medical supervision and can make a change of dosage .
&quot; at the time of the termination of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effectiveness of the insulin used , and can therefore change with conversion of the schem@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; the substances that can increase blood glucose levels and rein@@ forcing the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ glyc@@ emia , angi@@ ot@@ en@@ in @-@ Conver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ or , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ yl@@ line , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ lic , s@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of sympath@@ oly@@ tics such as Bet@@ ab@@ ino@@ ids , Cl@@ on@@ id@@ in , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and Reser@@ pin the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ al counter@@ parts can be deported or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies on reproductive @-@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ ism and human@@ ist regarding pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known if insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine occurs in human breast milk , but in general , insulin does not occur in the breast milk , nor is res@@ or@@ ating it after oral use . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the clinical trials published in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and in accordance with the prevalence of their rise ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare ( frequency based on the availability ) . &quot;

Li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy is missed to change the injection system within the injection area can occur in the result of a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ rop@@ hy on the injection station .
severe hypo@@ glyc@@ emia with consciousness can be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ k@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that will be treated by an appropri@@ ated person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose projection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose intake ( especially due to skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the inhibit@@ ing of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin delivery occurs faster and the mode of time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ in @-@ therapeutic doses of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional increase in the therapeutic effect of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice the fast mode of action , such as normal human@@ ized and achieves a full glucose effect of about 2 hours earlier than human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; the data was obvious that with an application of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal a comparable postoperative gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached , as with human@@ kind ( 30 minutes before the meal ) . &quot;
&quot; is@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal was used , a better post@@ den@@ ial control was reached in 2 minutes before the meal , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery is used in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , is a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human@@ kind ( see Figure 1 ) , which is reached before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in a gift of 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - before the start of the meal ) before the meal was given ( Figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal resolution , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in the gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the start of the meal compared to human@@ kind Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
