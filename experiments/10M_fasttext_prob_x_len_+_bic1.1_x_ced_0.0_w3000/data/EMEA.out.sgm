<seg id="6">"in the past, Abilify will be used to treat medium-severe episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients suffering from the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural problems when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or melting tablets in patients, which make the swallow of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients receiving other medicines simultaneously, the same as Abilify should be dismantled, the dose of Abilify should be adapted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of the nerve cells."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazol is probably mostly known as "partial Agents" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazol is like 5-hydroxytryptamin, and dopamine, but in a lower extent than the neurotransmitter works to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin is playing a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazol contributes to normalize the activity of the brain to normalize psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the revival of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in two studies, the effectiveness of injections was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, compared with a placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo which had been stabilised to 160 patients, where the manic symptoms have been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared to a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change of symptoms of patients with a standard scope for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also contributed studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets, and the solution for setting resorly (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Ablify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify was significantly more effective than placebo in four of the five short-time studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented the resumption of manic episodes of previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in 10- or 15-mg-doses, Abilify injections decreased more effective than placebo used symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), vomiting, Nausea (nausea), nausea and exhaustion, Ruhelodeficiency, Insomnie (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"at the end of the conclusion that the benefits of Abschizophrenia (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe episodes of patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and with those manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the result that the benefits of injections in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder, if a oral therapy is not suitable, opposite the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission announced the European Commission of the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. as a approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2968">"insulin lulisin differs very low of humankind, and the change means that it works faster and a shorter mode of life than a short-term humankind."</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was used in combination with a long-effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 572 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Apidra was investigated in a study with 878 adults in type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"the main indeator for efficacy was the change of the concentration of the substance of glycemylified hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted."</seg>
