&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into the whole &amp; URL . &quot;
machine translations are only very ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary . Bab@@ el@@ fish manufactures in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore should have no important decisions depend on without the translation previously .
&quot; only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be transl@@ ating on the Bab@@ el@@ fish side , where you can insert into over@@ translated texts directly . &quot;
&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . in spite of its small size , they provide some additional functions and simpli@@ fy the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by making this easier available . &quot;
for more information about use &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to download , select settings , select the card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard version modules from the package K@@ DE ; add @-@ ons . please note that maybe more modules installed on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you comp@@ ile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash or the list of stor@@ my , if present , er@@ ase . &quot;
the module filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s current working directory on different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; then select Extras DO@@ M @-@ tree ... and opening a new window with the DO@@ M der just displayed website . as default , the display begins with the root notes of the document , example : the element , all other knots the elements of this root canal . &quot;
&quot; the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; a further view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory contains local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views , to view the content of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of a @-@ called folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graph@@ ically . every object is presented by a rectangle , whose area is proportional to its size . this size must possess that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder , the size of a file is defined as the sum of size of entries in this manner . according to this way , large files can be detected , even if they can be seen far below in the folder hier@@ archy . according to this way , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ commands you can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap diagram is a rectangle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . to simpli@@ fy navigation possess the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful paint and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle , which is switched on colour mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the screws , or the figure of another file names as name , owners , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the different characteristics of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify if it is displayed at all , if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates is present or whether the surface of sub@@ ordin@@ ates is present or whether the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates can be present or if the area of sub@@ ordin@@ ates can occur in the sign of the tre@@ sp@@ ap . moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; in case algorith@@ ms for Tre@@ em@@ aps should rule the rule , that the area is proportional to size . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always available . please note that less space is lost for the frame if the rectangle is square . &quot;
&quot; as distribution of the surface of an entry for the sub@@ ordin@@ ated entries , the implementation will be left . here it is necessary for the labelling and to prevent space losses due to scope of space . the best methods of this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive stroke . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal area for an entry over the menu entry . instead , a sample pattern is drawn into the area of the superior entry , to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a lower entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View was originally intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for applying K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ rin@@ d . &quot;
the module gallery is available in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under ex@@ tras picture gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; dur@@ st re@@ cur@@ ated the li@@ der@@ lo@@ f@@ ad in its whole depth . you can &apos;t close any sub@@ folder and you can do it in a plug @-@ in file . you can do so by taking a point before the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as basic file , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ ches will not have photos as symbols . you can change them by using any any photo from the album and then you can find any more details on the folder symbol . for more details , you will find in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . afterwards , you should learn how to manage your albums and my key@@ word box to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw material support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ assi@@ sts . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files are described in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h @-@ Work@@ flow .
&quot; with your digital camera , you can connect to your digital camera and you can download your photos directly into &amp; di@@ gi@@ f ; albums you can download . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library of photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and each card readers will be supported by your operating system , with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for the actual transmission to the calcul@@ ator . the camera can also be realized via the picture transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras can also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communication with digital cameras , which has also been developed by the International Imag@@ ing Industry Association . it enables the transfer of images of digital cameras to host and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general are big files and transfers across the serial port is slowly . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports these cameras and leads the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras you will find under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 needs to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may need to see anything , or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things to &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; it is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common mod@@ ulation structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ m@@ g. and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in almost every way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is significantly easier , &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; by writing a small module to complement one function when the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either remove the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and lay down pictures everywhere : you can shut down a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , via the horizontal divi@@ ding line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture can not be found in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to raise the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IF@@ F , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio &quot;

&quot; another mode is better suitable to import quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically uploaded into the areas . the right of view is displayed in the right area . this is simplified by a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal soldering transactions are also working directly from the light , such as F4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main boards are available for both speakers in the lumin@@ table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function which you need to navigate to the crossing arrows . in order to hold the visible area of the image , you have to hold this an@@ cli@@ c and the &amp; L@@ MB . in mode a preview of these images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . use the zoom regulator among the pictures or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel in the picture and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview mode .
what is a Digital inventory management - from the fashion word ? digital data management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken up until the final edition and the permanent storage takes a form of digital operations . most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way .
&quot; we give you a tool , find a plan and practical tips as you can ass@@ ure your pictures , protect , protect , remove , backup , backup , ass@@ uring , ass@@ ess@@ ments , ass@@ ess@@ ments , optimize , wait , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , seeks , trans@@ forms and exported content that hab@@ it a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata are defined as data about data . met@@ ad@@ ata are defined according to your definition data that provide information on or a documentation of other data which are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I have to claim when you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not need to find out more than 1000 photos . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have to save &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; . the approach the met@@ ad@@ ata is guaranteed to save both in a database as well as in image files , you will definitely be able to access you with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and know before you have to store anything in your system , the structure of the information structure is to be arranged in contrast to your computer . you need to decide whether other access to your photos want to store or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . holiday images can be found quickly via your memory location . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; you will then publish a folder for pictures you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as ver@@ sion@@ ing photos , archi@@ ving , working processes , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % Archives and 5 % work files will not be re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the stack processing easier . separate new files .
the separation of original and work@@ files are simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are searching for an original or derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata to ad@@ ata the met@@ ad@@ ata in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; this ensures that Ex@@ if@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written in the file . if you forgot this , you can subsequently select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database by selecting the corresponding point in the album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? it &apos;s a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work starts , since you should select any photo sample , labelling and an assessment . of course , you can choose the same attribute and then put the value . it makes sense when you can focus on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s now leave us with key@@ word , key words , as you proceed with other programs in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ u@@ ed images from another source with embedded samples , then &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; automatically add the tree to the right place . the envel@@ oping of the hier@@ archy is not a problem and can easily be done by adding a sub@@ tree to another . the changed sample will be tra@@ ced by &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; updated while the sub@@ missions are pursued . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata shows up . this is a very rough representation , as each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth is composed of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are of all pictures . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog@@ u@@ ze your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want most don &apos;t want to see your photos just , you want to share it with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , you &apos;ll start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you this of the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . Wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you may even hear the silence of this panoramic view . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . remember , the key is to help you think about the motive that you can understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if a picture is not perfect , if it has the strength only with a lab@@ eling for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you can also save a lot of text in an international alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , and you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you need to export your pictures in web galleries , then you &apos;ll need to tell your images into the labels and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ an system . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities offered the ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already infinite . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future you can open your travel virtu@@ ell . you can also export your travel to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and referred to the practice of copyright , to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms will also apply in all changed versions , so also for work other . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setup site of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; as information is to be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creation and author ) : this field should be used to add your name , or the name of the photographers , for example , if it is not desired to protect the photographers name , then it should not be changed . this field does not support Kom@@ mas nor Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ ons as a separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel ( Syn@@ onym for Constitutional System ) : associated with the author . this field contains the description of the photographer . examples of this field can be titles as : employee photographer , free professional photographer or an independent commercial photographer . since this is a mem@@ orandum to the auth@@ oring field , this also must be completed . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the An@@ bi@@ eter@@ field to identify who has this photo . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press , these organizations may be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency is shown here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this is no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has no protection against mis@@ use . for individuals , this is a little more than basic knowledge . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and Hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; is available in the near future as a module for the stack processing .
&quot; topics : record mistake , turn@@ outs , power st@@ resses , EC@@ C , transmission error , ageing media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disinf@@ ecting , lifetime , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs who are lost on the street or a fire . this kind of losses are the same which can happen to you with traditional paper photos or negatives . in this section there are problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data production company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these have to be treated more than a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs into archive quality which claim more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece is a lifetime of 100 years for itself . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you can use good dis@@ cos and good recording , but they are not much more reliable than the cheapest but you write much reliable . it &apos;s about the right to choose . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very an@@ ob@@ sol@@ ete for errors , even if you just have written just . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for form@@ att@@ ing and control sum@@ s . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ att@@ ing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a favourable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it is still running for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all of which is said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording function on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . please check the media using a description , date &amp; author identification and afterwards on a clean , dark dry and before animals protected site . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media and software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ cos retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s manufacturer comprise a new disk , but not the data . Google is a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
soon : Dis@@ ks keep the longest in the temper@@ ate area of 35 ° C to 45 ° C in the temperature of the error . electronic parts of the controller are the most common errors that SM@@ ART can termin@@ ate this error . these are in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing r@@ ator . the expected age of life is between 4 and 5 years .
&quot; this is only a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also use data loss due to a current case before you have secured the files , but this losses can normally recover without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical appliances can &apos;t make a lot of power , that can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed devices . these can cause severe damage , hard@@ war@@ age , hard@@ war@@ dness , and other defects . protect themselves before the inev@@ itable which leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most widespread protection against power tips is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed and the rest is absorbed . however , it is usually in the form of a plug @-@ bar . remember that any plug @-@ bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a particular minimum of protection . you should also consider that it protects protection against lighten@@ ing and thus protects the correctly connected equipment . &quot;
&quot; since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection possibilities for the co@@ axial cable of cable mode@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection of your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete loss . even a failure of few seconds can lead to the loss of unbe@@ ar@@ able data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a frag@@ ile power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically provide battery energy . some models allow them to save your data and run the system . if you buy a US@@ V , you should be sure that they get the same quality standards such as an over@@ voltage protection . moreover , the life time of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; remember the potential risk that your computer system is exposed , and compare its safety in power disorders with the cost to avo@@ idance this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can always remember how good your machine can be protected . finally , you should always remember all cables before you go to the holiday . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web @-@ Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives , they are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you need to send data on compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important pictures . this is not a bad solution , but there is no general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory offers you more available , in the case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you will get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed only in reality . &quot;
data protection from the point of data backup are the web solutions very safe . data transfer errors are automatically adjusted for the TCP protocol and included in the range of backup and a partial memory . so they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ proof .
the graph illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are due to transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least the data integral between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that nobody is saying if a transmission error occurred . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you should have a photo of it . no one seems to have thought that in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data road than that in your computer .
&quot; un@@ reliable networks are a further source for transfers , as they generate interest within the data streams . in normal file systems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfers problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors per year . &quot;
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can cope with turn@@ outs on low level and can be scal@@ able . it is open source with many patents and is available soon as well as Linux ; and Windows is available soon . read this article in English .
&quot; Oracle has started an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs file system . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms used , and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the core . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in not@@ ebook , and 46 % in the workplace systems . in not@@ ebooks , the share of theft is 50 % . &quot;
data loss due to viruses is less common than the chis@@ els . it leads to a lower damage when theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; a long no longer sigh@@ ted .
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to find the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : in@@ correctly , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if the problem was not completely stored before the problem is lost , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 bl@@ ending settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that the technology continues to develop a natural border for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are not far from this border .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution has already deteri@@ orated for compact cameras and the final result is optimal for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have a high @-@ quality appearance . even DS@@ LR cameras have a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; today , you get an 750@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make any other for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test these backup before you make anything more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system , making use of disks or the order change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you luck if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough . they usually affect all the space or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ cent is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your coll@@ ateral up the stairs into the neighbourhood , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , a more common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a moment , without hist@@ ories and represents a complete copy of a time . &quot;
differentiation : a backup of the files have been changed since the last complete recovery . creates a complete moment@@ um on two periods : the full backup and the last differential backup .
&quot; in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ary f@@ use : a backup of the files have been changed since the last backup . you can restore the original status at any time . this securing comes to another securing system on the next with the exception that it was just off , and not continuously continuously . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike the script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only the difference of files are really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh .
secure major pictures directly after you have stored on your computer on a DVD or another op@@ tics medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly Mom@@ ent@@ intake for at least one month and a moment for every month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the picture file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keep , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ find pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility ... , use of the internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that approximately the period of time you are really interested in you because they remember your childhood or adolesc@@ ence , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; because the future is un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able because of your nature , you must consider everything today . unfortunately , there is no other way to do with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way to use as the current system backward . unfortunately , there is no other way to evaluate the current system backward , the easier is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is currently available for everyone . if you have an old system , so it is important to read your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert a newer standard . stay at open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialized pressure for the possibility to change a system in its size . this means always enlarged .
let &apos;s go out of which you have plans to have the scal@@ ability and the range you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . at * ni@@ x systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this range and put them on a new plate :
&quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command if your new record was detected by the system , but you don &apos;t depend on them . &quot;
&quot; / dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; / dev / S@@ DC # source is / dev / SD@@ B , the new record is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the plate in MB@@ ER ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ ze@@ 2@@ fs / dev / SM / 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software can read it ; then you can create this yourself . this task is easier to use this year .
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that dis@@ appears slowly from the market . they shouldn &apos;t use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was created as an open source standard designed to replace the G@@ IF . however , it is more loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , but not as many as T@@ IF@@ F needs . this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IF@@ F was widely used as a picture format . T@@ IF@@ F can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression ( De@@ fl@@ ate ) . however , you can store your pictures in this format . however , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
D@@ NG The Digital Negative File Format is a licensed and open resource format that has been developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is already available for using met@@ ad@@ ata . a hand@@ ful camera manufacturer D@@ NG is now available and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced his XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is available with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your photo , mostly in the rough format , mostly in the rough format , as it stores the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file , but it can consider how you use D@@ NG as container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that support for fully compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata standards that support a large range of application purposes and business models . to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I communities and the D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance efforts to achieve an extensive acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . so long the pictures on the camera code , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert Roh@@ files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for a sensitive processing , you can use external programs . if you come to the pictures with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata again . these were cut among other programs under the circumstances of the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the illustrated images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact page , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; you can find a description of how you have already installed on your hard disk , but you can add many advanced settings to import pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ ate bank . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; connect these with the machine , turn the camera on display mode , and turn them on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , you try to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ tig -@@ indicator at the bottom end and the images of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for file association settings are displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames are displayed and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you can download the photos on your computer , you may require a camera information on each entry . using the page features and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of a updated or met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information to be saved from the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded on your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have any information available .
&quot; the tab met@@ ad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer remark , GPS etc . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; or the image editing . please note that these met@@ ad@@ ata are not available at some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer , the click on the button can download and then download the selection from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; . when downloading the photos are not deleted , we recommend to check if the pictures are sure to delete photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired choice methods of &amp; K@@ DE ; as soon as you select the photos selected , use the button . you can download the button chosen as long as you can select some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , a new option is available to download . these pictures have been selected until now not by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; downloaded in this case , the new pictures are selected with a star in advance window . if you select this option , of course only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you use button buttons all download or selected selected button , a dialog appears to select the target album which will be displayed in the photos . the list of existing albums can be posted in the section of my albums . select the target album out of the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all of the button . if you want to delete the button . if you only want to delete some del@@ eting , you need to select this first and then delete delete chosen . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no possibility to restore you from the camera . you should not verify that the photos are successfully extingu@@ ished in the tr@@ ash@@ ers of &amp; K@@ DE ; so you should delete it completely . if you want to delete a camera memory , you should do so much faster . if you want to delete a camera memory , you should do so much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are often used as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once again after the photos from the camera were deleted , so you can make photos of different recording criteria into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time , in which the image has been made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and sk@@ e@@ wers of the picture and for dat@@ ory bases . if you use this latter option automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transmission opens three further options that will be carried out before the photos on the record are stored . the first two concern data on the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ dent@@ ism . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information is copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you wish to use another date format as the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . turn the option on date and time . for further adjustments you should read the help of command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file name , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in capital letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; for a photo is used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera is stored in preview . your settings can be saved and automatically used when you can open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to perform a automatic rotation during the heart rate . not all cameras make this information ready . in section of side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that embedded your camera in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , it leaves &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the button Advanced and select the automatic rotation in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has information on the date , where the photo was made , you can use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; this sub@@ missions are based on the image data . all pictures with the same date are available in the same album . not all cameras are available in the same date . not all cameras may be embedded in the same folder . in section page met@@ a @-@ data you can read what information your camera might have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you &apos;ll need to turn this option . use the button @-@ based signatures at the bottom end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to your camera is the button download . select upload dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; please choose to choose files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the picture selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; you , where the images will be loaded up . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired file and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . this is a position , which can be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude and can be displayed on a card . the identification of data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to create an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser to the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; users want to locate the area of the photos , or simply only think this aspect , it &apos;s good to add the position data of a photos . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 offers many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map refer@@ encing . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , about a editing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic mapping ( manual ) and last of the manual input of well @-@ known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there are currently no camera to work with a GPS unit . but there is a few that work with GPS recipi@@ ents . either as map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be stored with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you need to save these data but in the GP@@ X format , as this is the only format that is supported by the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS which can extract the data from pictures and the GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you want to know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script that uses the Ex@@ if@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the prec@@ urs@@ ed coordinates , which can be created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street species . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation data for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; try to give you much control over his work processes , as possible . there are many settings that you have to access this settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; this action can be set to show a preview of view or image editing . therefore , you will put the default behavior of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; firm , if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard candidate and copyright data . these data are automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , when using a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; Aut@@ ort@@ itel is a syn@@ onym for the author : this field should be the professional name of the photographer . these may be used as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description to the author , this also has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to give it the photo . this must not be the author if this is a picture of the image , such as Reuters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be listed here , then the group or agency should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions save the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rim . this means that the met@@ ad@@ ata are permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; these met@@ ad@@ ata are also available with other programs and can be imported without going lost .
&quot; images as embedded in JPEG pictures ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JPEG pictures : this is synchron@@ ized the comments that you can add to your photos , which can also be read from other images . attention : in pictures that already contain labels , these are over@@ written by the by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that will appear when the mouse poin@@ ter will rest on a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports a number of different image formats and some video formats . to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; to determine which file types &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; Alb@@ um@@ ord@@ ner , which has no this enh@@ ancements , has not been ignored by &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; the default settings can be reset , by clicking the button on the right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the att@@ itudes of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; can be placed on this page on the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode , you should only use different sizes and synchron@@ ous mode . if you have one , then you can get better view results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select this here . you can use the tool bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ated areas of a picture can be marked with dark or brigh@@ ter colour in the picture . these colors are set here . in the picture , this review can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the pictures are encoded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the next explanation . &quot;
&quot; using the P@@ NG compres@@ sing , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality , because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value on a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 compression compression . &quot;
&quot; using the T@@ IF@@ F files , you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression of T@@ IF@@ F images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IF@@ F pictures . it has no influence on the image quality , as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss . &quot;
&quot; with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files you can save loss free . even if you were able to reduce the loss of losses , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than at normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ ad@@ ata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um , the image processing was only one image viewer for photos . currently it develops very quickly to a tool to mani@@ pulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of the image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard measure is that all green pixels are identical to the CCD sensor . if you use this option , this difference creates a little bit soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option has a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 G@@ etting pattern with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white component of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white is not reset . default is a fixed colour balance which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ min@@ ed pictures in four steps more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the top light , so the parts of your images are burned , because the in@@ ability of your camera will begin to consider as through the in@@ ability of your camera . the setting of colours creates some unusual results since they are trying to re@@ construct a few parts of the missing information from the sh@@ rou@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this is possible , as blue pixels in general is not so fast as fill@@ ers like green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red proportions of the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option , you get the possibility to set a level . here &apos;s a value of three one compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image . &quot;
put the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably need to put it somewhat higher than the standard 1 . this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; -@@ image processing should be made even later . in order to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing you should be conservative .
&quot; a digital image process is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the part @-@ filtered image sensor , which have many cameras and a matrix @-@ coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&quot; and D@@ cra@@ w came to you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used on the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenti@@ ls , you can use the rot@@ - and blue correc@@ tions here . this is certainly the best method for a color error correction , as you will be carried out during the shell . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions as this again should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; information like the color information from a color space in the others are so accurate as possible .
question questions when a picture is opened in picture editing / color management module with raw files are starting .
&quot; color profile file , set up the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you can save all your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; exam@@ ines this folder then during the start . &quot;
att@@ itudes of the ICC profile you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative against X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color are not managed by the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be set to the camera manufacturers and model you use . not all profiles are produced on the same type . currently there are some , such as Canon , that do not need to perform d@@ cra@@ cker or gamma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma does not need to perform the color tone yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are further options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image from a device would be given . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors so very satisfied , instead of leaving on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious what color profile is planned for them . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; K@@ DE ; image concerned and image workers . many modules have been written to cooperate with each program that support the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your Distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want , and these are then loaded by &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and beyond , you &apos;ll find some also in the context menu of the curtains . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks , which can be carried out by modules , can be set up in the menu Settings menu . &quot;
for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manu@@ als of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is the time between the imag@@ inations , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other an@@ ir@@ ons turn off the met@@ ad@@ ata or off , which are built at the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera features show on the left side a list of all at the time supported cameras . on the right side there is a button automatic detection that is attemp@@ ting to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently , there are serial settings , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have an US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire @-@ mass storage camera from the camera box . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , please indicate your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you need to connect the camera with your computer , bring them into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ bi@@ ere you from whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set a camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear on the camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog for the shift dialog for the shift of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash@@ mer , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; in del@@ e@@ tion of a photos in an album you can find another details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; if you use the option changes in the right side bar without feedback , otherwise you need to apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also under@@ take the display of the welcome screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; at the beginning , this acceler@@ ates the starting process of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Bei@@ m Start after new photos are seeking &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; the basic file after new or dissolved albums / photos are extended ; this extends the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; if something from the base file has been deleted , it asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; you know whether it is to er@@ ase this from the database . &quot;
various colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . you can select your settings from the tool bar below . a preview of available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; you will find more information about this tut@@ orial .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; contains a fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on preview of a picture or through the context menu of preview and selection of entry ads / Edit . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; so they are not part of your distribution . more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules are available in section image editing .
&quot; a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
&quot; one menu bar at the top edge , including the tool bar for quick access to the most common functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions change your photos . however , no functions will change the original photo before you can save the original photo , before you can &apos;t restore the original photo , once you have saved the original photo , as soon as you have saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; so you should add a copy of your image , before you change it . you can save it with file stores . &quot;
&quot; as long as you do not have the photo stored , you can re @-@ restore the original picture by using the picture file re@@ produce or button the button . you will lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last stores . &quot;
&quot; virtually every action of the image processing can be made back or restored . the last action can make you back , by using how you want to use backward and re@@ produced by selecting the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to restore and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; the tool@@ bar or restore button in the tool@@ bar must express a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all campaigns are made in between too and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the picture processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have changes in the current picture , you will be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can use in the photo and zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in tool@@ bar or entries in the transparent menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; display full screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . you &apos;ll come to the normal view , where you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c button . normally , you can call this in the dialog dialog box . you can see this from the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; main window . see the section for setting the image editing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current picture , you can print in the menu file image and get the default &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sets . all picture directions can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album exp@@ orting printing assist@@ ent . if you follow the assist@@ ants , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the main window has an side@@ bar on the right edge , the important information and actions for the selected images are available . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation components , even in image editing . it is displayed if one of the five riders will be cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the label view , you can enter labels with unlimited size or insert . note that all special characters are allowed . the labels will be copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC@@ - fields that you can be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data can only support ASCII characters , and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and are made special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should notice these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you , you &apos;ll have to use either the button application or simply change to the next picture , the labelling will then be stored . &quot;
&quot; besides the user @-@ button , there is a button . you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or database . however , you can also read the met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . this will always be performed if you have chosen an met@@ ad@@ ata setting , which is always written into the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the review rating shows an assessment of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting order . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 , select this and use the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field , which follows the scheme in the following table : &quot;
the key@@ word view shows a search box for filtering of the keywords , the key@@ word tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; -@@ session coun@@ ters &quot;
the key@@ word tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the specified search phrase . you can quickly restri@@ ct the number of possibilities in search for a key@@ word . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief for the input of j@@ acks at a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set in the tree by marking the corresponding pin fields in the tree . all tags of a picture are stored in the IP@@ TC field Key@@ word .
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the key@@ word @-@ tree , this will only be used on the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to set a selection with a key@@ word , please read the section sample filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the picture displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - file , key@@ word and view@@ point filter is used , only the cut quantity of these two are displayed . all samples are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also choose tags and place . suppose you have chosen several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word exists , you can easily put it out of the right side@@ bar and place on the selection . then a dialogue that you asks if you want to set the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is reduced to three images . they were set up with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and afterwards it was taken a key@@ word from the right key@@ word tree to choose from here . a dialog asks if this key@@ word is supposed to be set . &quot;
these search for changes will take place at any start of the program . you can also be switched off under settings .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and notice that it would be a or should be , you can change it easily with a double @-@ click on the text and control range . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry in the database is searched for . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or a string that is already placed in the database .
&quot; for example , you can define an expanded search over all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group@@ ing options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then take the button group@@ ing . the options see as follows : &quot;

this article / tut@@ orial was written primarily by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I &apos;ve found it mainly on &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you have a colour administered workflow , this is the colors that are actually photographed by your camera or scanner , you can achieve the colors on your monitor or scanner . you can print the colors on your camera or scanners , or the colors that you print or in the Web publish them out of your digital dark chamber . &quot;
&quot; if the theme is based on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons it needs to ask for the results . unfortunately , this tut@@ orials must provide you sufficient background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information will enable you to make your own informed decisions that you may receive the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image for all six listed below are fulfilled , then you don &apos;t need to worry about color management . &quot;
they work on a monitor that is cali@@ br@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other educational expend@@ itu@@ res are by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB is so well and the life for everyone is so easy , why should you use another colour space and do so thoughts about paint wounded ng ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the RGB comparison of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fe@@ eder @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the RGB colour space , the tri@@ ang@@ ular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger colour bro@@ wn@@ ings , please visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and then click on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to k@@ alli@@ on my monitor if I decided to work in the RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the RGB @-@ color space , or not , you &apos;ll have to work your monitor . so you &apos;ll need to use your monitor on s@@ RGB cables , then you &apos;ll need to use your monitor on the RGB @-@ Standard k@@ alli@@ bri@@ a , a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled exposure values over the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test item can change as bright as possible without its colour sha@@ dy . this function is often a Mag@@ ical correction for images which are dark or washed out . &quot;
&quot; same : this method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ous factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intens@@ ities as as flat as possible . sometimes it achieves very good results in the improvement of the image , sometimes it produces just rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either works miracles in a picture or it destro@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; automatic : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusted the red , green and blue channels on the entire history of history . &quot;
&quot; contrast to the contrast : this method improves contrast , and the lumin@@ osity of the RGB values of a picture by the one of the lowest and highest values of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photographs . &quot;
the white @-@ cut off &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; is a semi @-@ automated tool to perform the white right of a photos .
&quot; the white @-@ off correction is slightly restricted because over a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can do too far from the original image , areas can be done with over@@ exposed coating . if you can do the white immediately in the base mode , then your possibilities will be better to get better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white par@@ ano@@ dised content of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ y@@ m . you will start it over the menu entry colours white in the picture processing .
&quot; the background window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image will be adapted to the image of the tool . the preview is to see dynam@@ ically the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original box , then it is enough to click on the lower window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of Pi@@ xels is displayed as vertical line in hist@@ ogram .
&quot; right up , a hist@@ ogram will display that once you can change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels can choose whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum will be called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and gamma . shadow Adjust@@ ment allows you to improve your photos or di@@ mm@@ ing your photos . &quot;
&quot; to use an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and afterwards to use selected paint to the calculation of the colour temperature of the white tube . on this kind , the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white immediately with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
&quot; the surplus @-@ coating increases the colors if more than a colour channel of the pipe is coated .. you will see the combined result in the white line . this will appear in a preview of pure indicator , and has no effect on the final picture . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and store , exactly this . each attitude of the white equ@@ ities you have set to store in a text file and store again later . &quot;
&quot; the button pre@@ ferences sets back all the filter values back to their default value and the respective neutral white . note that neutral settings will be revealed to another photo than your original . if you store this image , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the coefficient per color channel of the working picture . 8 @-@ bit coding is the far widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coefficient is better for high @-@ quality images . these coding also requires more record field , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IF@@ F and D@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be carried out through the lower window for the hel@@ lig@@ ations . detailed instructions for use of color profiles , you can draw the chapter color management . &quot;
&quot; another important tool can be found in the menu of colors . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple colour channels simultaneously . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always require the same correction , and therefore you can always find the same correction . in manual to audio correction , you will find more information . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; tool color defects provides four color effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , an ne@@ on effect and an edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the image was completed , and afterwards the development of the image was completed . the result was a partial neg@@ atively light . the result was a part of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar control . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another increase is finally generated by a negative image that is not to create on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar thermal effect . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) , and the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
the Vi@@ vi@@ d @-@ Filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it diff@@ ers from a satur@@ ation that it makes a stronger contra@@ diction that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for an optimized colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thereby a reference for its smooth picture structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours with daylight and high contra@@ sts . however , the characteristics of the choice for natural photography . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly paints a few photography , specifically to which the barely landscapes are expected . &quot;
the neo @-@ filter sim@@ ulates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contra@@ diction . the parameters is controlled by the brightness of the result and the sl@@ ate repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ ens . in large pictures the filter can cut the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras frequently have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not un@@ usually correct to change the colors in the menu . you can view the different color effects of your photos with the tools in the menu . once you are satisfied with the result you can use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you have a photo of bad weather conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce the satur@@ ation instead of them . all changes you can perform in preview . if Him like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ cine strength / contrast / Gamma , the tool is very complicated to improve exposure of exposure . even if the dialog is very complicated , you need for the purpose of the shooting purpose only in the field of sliding . concrete is the three shooting below the history program . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of int@@ oler@@ ance , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or of the selected area . under the graph , three sliding of the image can be cli@@ cked and the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is the regulator to move and make sure how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , updated with the settings of the picture , updated on the left side are the following options available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set if the hist@@ ogram is dominated by linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram will be dominated by a single column . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic sub@@ division is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controllers : the top of the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three paint brush chains can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input of the sha@@ dows , medium and light tones automatically . moreover , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output : the output values allow the choice of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers , which can be used in order to evaluate the output level as in the input devices . for example , compression of output can be used as background as background , while something else can be seen in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
automatically : this button will automatically set the image values automatically depending on the int@@ oler@@ ance of the image .
save as and store : these buttons can be stored in the file system and re@@ loaded later . this Gim@@ p levels will be used .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will automatically be adjusted for all sha@@ des , means and sunny oils . enable the colour pi@@ p@@ ette to use and click on the preview of the original program for Rot@@ - , Green , Blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; this option is checked all colour channels , to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , see an example of the adjustment of the input elements applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the origin@@ als and the target picture is displayed . the preview will be updated by dynamic depending on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
&quot; Modi@@ fi@@ zi@@ ere channel : this selection box allows the channel to give the channel to be changed by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures featuring a digital camera , the linear mode of linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps further . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a spa vent@@ ures to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that this bright tones can be respon@@ sive with a dar@@ ker selection . &quot;
&quot; a look at the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this mark on the curve you want to change the original value , create a point on this line and move it up and off until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and store : with these buttons you can do exactly this . every curve you can create exactly this file system and can be loaded later . the file format is the Gim@@ p spa format .
&quot; automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , medium and sunny oils . activate the colour pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to put the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposed plates controls all colour channels in order to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a black @-@ white picture that has been corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and Sundays was used with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel bl@@ ender of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; image editing is a tool to improve the colour channels or change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the channel @-@ Mixer is another highly developed tool to mix colours of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer .
&quot; with the channel in@@ optional box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note as you can correct the channels by selecting the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window displays a preview of . the original can be viewed as a comparison of the own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target picture has a red mark@@ er . if you positioning this in the picture , a vertical line in hist@@ ogram will display the respective color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regulator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels as well . if you can use L@@ umin@@ ance , as the channel @-@ Mixer is able to keep your photos . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the respective color components . this is especially convenient if you can also reduce the respective color equipment . this is especially convenient if you can reduce the green color @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible room that comes from far@@ my@@ ths . if that is the case you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion so you can reduce your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion first . &quot;
save as well as loading buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; this option is checked all colour channels , to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . here it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel was re@@ arranged . the original image is enabled . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture under ( 2 ) .
black / white photography always was intri@@ gu@@ ing because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step because color images can easily be converted on the computer . also with a set of film rol@@ lers .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits especially good to portraits of heaven . thus similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Oran@@ filmed . &quot;
Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic effects of the effects and can sim@@ ulate lun@@ ches for the day time . so similar to the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film coating with an yellow lens filter and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter .
Sep@@ i@@ aton : creates warm light and medium tones while he adds a little cold in the shr@@ ubs . this is very similar to the process of fl@@ atter@@ ing a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ i@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; General tools texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures on a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a screen , the Sti@@ ch of an old master , a pop kind portrait of enlarged points or like a wall picture on a wall . the menu entry picture texture can be used for it . &quot;
relief : shifting this parameter to the right increases the drop of depth and three @-@ dimensional texture on the picture .
a paper texture has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) . the parameter relief is set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is no easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to keep the picture a decorative eye . this is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to be started using image editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . through a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , it ador@@ ned with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button and decor@@ ative with patterns . &quot;
&quot; width : provides the width of the frame in percent . the value for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % . &quot;
&quot; the target picture will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the pressure of the images , especially if you have used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert easily a form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture at any point . this also goes on several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text size , orientation , color from the colour space and the character set . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; every setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , until you are stored on the button &quot; OK &quot; after the image has been stored , the text is part of the picture . it cannot be changed . &quot;
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; tool template can apply a template on a picture .
the menu Image template apply in picture editing can be used to lay template on a picture .
for the template there is no restrictions about the size and orientation . however you need to add the P@@ NG file format . if you want to add the P@@ NG file format . if you want to add your template &apos;s file size ; please send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ fted @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll need to set your template folder with the button base folder in dialogue . select the folder in which you have copied the template data . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root folder is set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil folder . the selection of an folder will update the sten@@ cils of templates automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , three buttons are located with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button is enlarged the below picture . it is cent@@ ered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; shr@@ inks : this button resi@@ zed this picture below . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you &apos;ll need to dimin@@ ish the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to use the template on your image . then the picture will be adjusted automatically .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; represents three different tools for sharp@@ ening . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ening is a traditional tool for sharp@@ ening . it is very fast and simple , but produces particularly in dark areas , gra@@ ce@@ ful pictures . &quot;
&quot; un@@ sharp@@ ening mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture . actually , it is not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Chang . &quot;
&quot; Re@@ focus is probably the best of the three , because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus , as well as most digit@@ ised pictures need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . elements that are smaller than the resolution will be combined with only minimum lower than the resolution . the same phenomenon can be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally need more retro@@ spec@@ tively as normal cameras for the private user . &quot;
JPEG pictures often have been applied to a camera internal sharp@@ ening . pictures in the shell format however must always be weak@@ ened during processing .
&quot; some scanners turn a sharp@@ ening filter already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this , you get the control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by using a photo using the sharp@@ ening of sharp@@ ening . you can sharp@@ ening the menu with the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; but you should avoid this , as the results are not very natural : sharp@@ ening the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also strengthens the noise . in general , the usable technique for sharp@@ ening the tool Re@@ focus . in general , you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw a bit soft , is much easier than it to sharp@@ ening . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry of the dialog box , and experiment with the menu entry on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove mu@@ er from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the picture . the background window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in radius or the amount rein@@ force the effect . if you make the un@@ sharp@@ ness mask to be strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ats in the vicinity of sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius can be affected as many pixels on each side of an edge by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ en . therefore , you should use images in its final resolution . &quot;
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignor@@ ant picture one of the original is added . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the amount of RGB value and it can be applied to the edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are exemp@@ t with a soft change between the killing and therefore beauty of water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked , it was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Re@@ focus is focused on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copyright @-@ protected relief filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
&quot; this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ uss@@ er@@ en@@ quot ; in which it uses the deadline for sharp@@ ening the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese . it is usually achieved better results than un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start the menu by using colors Re@@ focus on the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; in practice , the circular f@@ uss works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ishing . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ing has a very long tail , which leads to far from the original tor@@ ques , which is widely influenced by the remote pixel . this causes un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular f@@ uss . it is the most important parameters for use of this module . for most pictures should set the default value 1 good results . but you may have a higher value if your image should be very un@@ sharp then but to Heiligen@@ sch@@ ein .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; cat@@ ch@@ filter : an increase in the space filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values improve from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise level is very bad . a useful value is 0,@@ 03 . a high value will continue to decor@@ ate the image . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your un@@ sharp@@ ness g@@ ossi@@ p is caused . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 if you need to increase this value to 0 , you may also increase the correlation and / or cat@@ astrop@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ Size : this value determines good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; save as well as loading buttons are used exactly to this purposes . any prec@@ urs@@ or parameter is used for you , and then it can be loaded for later and then can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , color , and int@@ oler@@ ance on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible , but leave later un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and compressed , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed picture . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp usually produces better results than sharp@@ ening . this could be caused by causing un@@ sharp m@@ asked a bigger neighborhood than sharp@@ ening . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , it must always be un@@ sharp . even under optimal conditions , it can never be able to remove any effect . for the Vi@@ enn@@ ese filters you can still show that it is the optimum linear@@ ity filter . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is often better with the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this image has been made with analogue camera . the un@@ focused result is due to un@@ sufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods for sharp@@ ening methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regulator is de@@ but@@ ted the un@@ sharp@@ ening of the area , in order to generate a more natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the color tin@@ ned allows a customized color for the pupils . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ form Algorith@@ m was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ be@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre@@ ferences as a starting point to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the default settings are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings in a adjustment , you can use the rider believers and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed analysis p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth glass view on the image . for greater values mainly homogen@@ ous regions smooth@@ ed and details are needed . a value of 0.9 should not be retro@@ spec@@ tively necessary . please note that the details are always necessary . &quot;
&quot; sec@@ tional movement Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value is evenly distributed in all directions while a value of 1 only in one direction . if you have a film grain or CCD noise , a high value of similar patterns will produce . JPEG arti@@ facts are best eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1 . &quot;
&quot; smo@@ othing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smo@@ othing factor above all , then the relative smo@@ othing . put this value for the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is given greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smo@@ othing . this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : indicates how often the algorithm run through . normally 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle breakdown &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected , there should be also small . be sure that small angle should be set for a long term . so you should choose this value so big and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step @-@ wide in pixel . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel glasses , and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more than quality you can get through the selection of this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to allow him .
the buttons save as and store do exactly this . each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
image errors correct is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however it can last long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button .
&quot; below , you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that caused by a bad camera in the fore@@ ground that caused by a bad film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce bil@@ lows . it uses a copyright algorithm from Peter rear .
&quot; this tool provides selected image filter to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing from camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ es ; effects of sc@@ anned pictures from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sens@@ ing digital cameras , you can read this tut@@ orial in this tut@@ orial . &quot;
&quot; the screenshot above shows a typical scene with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a grain noise , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the lower details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain at default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) that is used for the filter . great values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be p@@ umped over the picture and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and so for smaller mistakes . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ening of the sharp@@ ness . if it is increased , noise pointed tips will be deleted . if the value is high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not be added , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not get any more and remove noise or lubri@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge accuracy of the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the frequency response can be removed or smoke tips can occur . put it on a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the memory process through the details settings .
color : controls the colour toler@@ ance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not influence the memory process through the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the G@@ amm@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas , typically stronger than the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius to the variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges can appear , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for that . &quot;
&quot; store under and loading : these buttons are used exactly . all parameters of the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) , the noise reduction was applied to the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it is a picture of cr@@ isp@@ y for your purpose . the solution to use a bit soft , is thank@@ fully easier than a picture to sharp@@ est . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry of the dialog box , and experim@@ enting the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ works .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of undes@@ ired arti@@ facts about your images . it is very good adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s cat@@ er@@ ical , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sors , scrat@@ ches , compression cases and local errors that makes the content such as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for colour@@ ing and tex@@ en@@ forcement . the algorithm is developed by a different tool , the image error correction , was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ or and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts reduce the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a loss of compression ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this attitude should correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons save as and store exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be stored in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , however , it can last long and take a high CPU load . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can reduce how to reduce a photo with equ@@ anim@@ ating noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 . you can see the in@@ famous film coating on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures will be reduced to an old color photo that was created with an scanner . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tools Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove Hot@@ pixel from photos depicting using a CCD camera . it uses algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ opp .
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are particularly high @-@ quality raw material photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression can have a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; there are currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool is recogni@@ zable by the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to take the dark image directly in connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the correct image . note that the assistant will notice the last dark image and once again re@@ charges this automatically in the next meeting . &quot;
the picture area and the preview can help you correct the result . the record window shows the output of the fil@@ let with the current settings . bad pixels are lifted up in all areas .
select an area around the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate this pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : it is an average of the neighbouring pixel size . it is assigned to all def@@ aul@@ ted pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixel which have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block will be moved to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; Kub@@ isch : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn , to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cuban curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; Vig@@ net@@ tier@@ i correction is a tool to correct the Vig@@ il , i.e. sub@@ str@@ ated corners , a picture . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , especially those in the middle and large photo format , can &apos;t be easily lit up the whole sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ or@@ bit@@ en@@ quot ; ( sha@@ kes ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the picture by taking the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective demonstrate their behavior under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; but he also has dis@@ advantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to maintain the camera with the hand . wide angle lens should also be possible , even with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ening effects are produced by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s fil@@ ming and color scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter , which is made without this filter , the transformation of a C@@ enter@@ filter is applied to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction Filter and with three further exposure of the target picture . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light output at the point of the largest density filter at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density amounts from 1 , or randomly a light intensity of 2 , sp@@ iny .@@ Incre@@ ase the density to compens@@ ate a larger degree of v@@ int@@ ment , reduce it to a small degree . &quot;
Leu@@ ps strength , contrast and gamma settings : the editing of a picture reduces the intensity of the pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options , because you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle re@@ adjustment of the target picture , so let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ff ; image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ animal correction on a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ scape in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture has been performed on the image with this tool .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; lenti@@ l dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright algorithm from David Ho@@ d@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion can not be corrected using this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree deals with the universal geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or conv@@ ex shape of the image . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fla@@ wed on the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient @-@ efficient foil correc@@ ts the remote corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion can be eliminated almost eliminated . &quot;
General : this value controls the thickness of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected tons @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion and positive values of kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion part . this value affects stronger in the edges as in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls , the &apos; corners Param@@ eters over@@ turned the sign of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and leads to a correction first degree through . negative values increase during positive the picture .
bright : this value adjusted the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the picture in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of default correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values as default . &quot;
the load or ho@@ ver@@ @-@ shaped correction should be carried out before all enco@@ ders or size changes . if you have to cut this correction as all the first . if you have a picture to cut and then a load @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong order .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides a vertical and horizontal aid line . move it to an important place , such as the marine or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . in connection , you can correct the load / kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a kis@@ ses @-@ shaped dist@@ ortion , the resulting image is black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu , remove them from the image processing or via the zoom regulator of this dialogue . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures the load @-@ shaped correction is enough . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct the view of the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you keep the camera with the hand you will always keep a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the load @-@ shaped correction to a church in Norway . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate infrared film of G@@ imported Gur@@ u &apos;s website . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the range for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can consider the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can sim@@ ulate two parameters to sim@@ ulate film @-@ gra@@ zing and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) within the conversion . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; as the filter color channels for re@@ produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / W photos , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infr@@ a @-@ infr@@ a painting in New Zealand . the original picture is under ( 1 ) and the revised picture under ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the top lights .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; filters film grain is an easy to use tool to re@@ produce film grain on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tri @-@ X , to enhance the sensitivity of the films to increase the manufacturer big silver grain of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film body effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ zing sight specifically in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be used to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher levels needed , you may apply to ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the film body effect on a black / white picture . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) , the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil paintings creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two controllers to influence this effect . the upper hand cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . thick brush are better for great pictures . smo@@ othing the gl@@ aci@@ al or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that worked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels is 1 and smooth 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; filter coal @-@ drawing use color and intensity gra@@ dient to produce a carbon@@ ic ch@@ iz@@ ze . therefore , the lines that have served themselves slowly . it &apos;s helpful if you wish to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . these are good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper regulator will select the pin size and the lower adjust the contrast ( gluten ) . &quot;
this is an example of carbon recording filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified picture ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjust@@ ing the int@@ oler@@ ance value .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; filter engraving shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copyright algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color does not use the differences between color and intensity to transform the picture into a gray , mon@@ ished landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the revised picture ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; using this filter group , you can transform a normal photo in a work of artwork using a dist@@ ortion effect . it uses copyright algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
shaft blocks 1 : divide the picture in cells and can look it as if it is considered by glass blocks .
shaft blocks 2 : analog to the wave blocks 1 is dist@@ orted to a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can break this effects at any time with the button .
&quot; using this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by un@@ sharp@@ ening effects . it uses the copyright algorith@@ ms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
zoom un@@ sharp@@ ening : wi@@ red the picture along st@@ ern@@ al lines that go off from a centre . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the image by turning the pixel to a center . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ red the picture to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera technology . the object seems to be back into the background .
&quot; movement of motion : wi@@ ped the picture by horizontal movements of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ amour photos , or add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
cont@@ actor un@@ sharp@@ ening : wi@@ red the picture due to random shift of pixels and sim@@ ulates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color basins in the picture and wi@@ red them without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells , and then created it through the col@@ t with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore break this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice small tool to make reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ es on your image . this makes it natural your images a natural look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n protected algorith@@ ms .
&quot; tropical size allows the size of the drops . since the drop size is not growing automatically with the size of the image , it is often necessary to decrease the size of the image . number of fish changes the optical effect of drops on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can hold a range of shelves with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ f . use the selection tool to keep the area , e.g. a face , which should be freely accessible . if you follow the filter shelves , the range will remain free of shelves . &quot;
this is an example of the shelf filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the revised picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values have been used for this example .
&quot; if the photo is the wrong orientation , you can bring it by sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu trans@@ forming or trans@@ formers . &quot;
photo shooting is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to shr@@ ub is simple . the big question is , how can you find a picture on or gu@@ essed the details ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can change it on the desired size with the tool size . select transform@@ ations in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to change size is using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool for bl@@ aze . &quot;
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation ( e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm was developed by the IM@@ AGE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g Project .
you need to tell the tool how to change size . these settings are available in the rider &apos;s new size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio is maintained : when this setting is enabled , the new size of the original aspect ratio is maintained by entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; rule : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is given greater structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geomet@@ ry of the image . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons save as and store are used exactly . every single occupancy can be saved as text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; Foto : bub@@ bles is very fast in what it makes , but it can last very long and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for a photograph shown by a small paint picture on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard increase .
&quot; the cutting of a photos isn &apos;t just a common operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to put together . it simply allows you to cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and draw the rectangle . you will see this rectangle , while using the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos will be cut off . this allows you to change a good overview of your photo by clicking on the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle , you can easily draw on the corners of the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting section , use the button 1 button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimm@@ ed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file saving or save file below in the file to save the newly created photo . &quot;
&quot; in the lecture area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog is maintained . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format size is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio also uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always equal , regardless of whether you can see or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons , horizontal , horizontal or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can set up with the Max . proportion button to cut the area to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio increases its settings , depending on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the cutting tool for the next time , these settings are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data are reflected the cut @-@ cut picture and not the original picture . &quot;
&quot; you enable assistance to help with assistance to help you , so you can get your pictures better . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles is an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles . &quot;
&quot; golden middle : the golden middle is a division that is on different natural growth pattern , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the flo@@ wering leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things that we can do as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has already been used for the old Egyptians and the Greeks who used their temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you can produce your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is directed by the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the divi@@ der divi@@ der is 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . one composition will follow this rule as visual harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden center provides liquid aid lines when you set up a picture . these help are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to third el@@ gel , the golden spiral creates a liquid line which can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition leads the view of the spiral and creates a symm@@ etri@@ cal visual flow . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is the right corner of golden spiral , also called golden rectangle . it should be something that the eye can lead to the heart of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can be just as without the eye , it will be able to fulfill its task . &quot;
&quot; the gold triangles are also derived from the above mentioned gold spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle of the sides of the golden rectangle . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles there can be no simultaneous triangles . diagonal to these lines can be a static object of dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden triangles to break your frame , create a effect of professional photographer dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach differently . &quot;
&quot; the options Horizont@@ ally reflect and vertically , can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic particles . &quot;
&quot; using the button color , you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines your current picture . &quot;
the Free rotation is a tool to turn on any angle every angle .
&quot; if you do a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things to repair a angle . you can choose this with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; image editing and the tool free rotation . choose trans@@ forming Free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; turn your picture with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ p@@ case is specified in degrees . with the button settings , you can set the sliding door to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right top . &quot;
&quot; to help your help , the module is available a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to move the two lines . after you have an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . a possibility to repair it is the function transformer cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after rotation , but please note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ inspec@@ t trans@@ forms are carried out by a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas which are created by transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees to the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle right : shows the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : shows the actual angle in degree at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective the image becomes a little dirty . for single adaptation , this effect is small but two adjustments generate twice the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after completing the perspective , you will get unbe@@ ar@@ able tri@@ ang@@ ular holes on the corners . a possibility to transfer this is the picture with transformer cutting from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to shift a part of the picture into one direction and the other part in the opposite . a horizontal shifting , for example , the upper part of the picture is changed to the left and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module via trans@@ formers . &quot;
&quot; use your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can adjust horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press on default , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of Eff@@ ective will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the lecture area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , vertical and horizontal line will be built . move the mouse to an important point like e.g. the lake , a wall of a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the set tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after which you have carried out the calibration , the image will be wi@@ ped a bit . for a single noise , this effect is mostly neg@@ li@@ gible but two ch@@ ases could avoid twice as much confusion and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after crossing the picture , the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ ang@@ ular holes in the corners . one possibility to eliminate this is the image of trans@@ forming cutting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write the formats available from your system and , in some cases , from the way as these libraries comp@@ ile , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted . &quot;
&quot; due to this depen@@ dency of other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all available file formats available on their system . however , you will always find JPEG and T@@ IF@@ F . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; shows only files in formats to those who knows . this happens from the file extension and comparison with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension in the list is listed , you can change this list of file extended the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; accepts further information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F . some cameras allow you to use it even using it . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ fted ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the image data on a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general there is better , smo@@ other results as JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save loss @-@ free when this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw file format , you can read more about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Landscape and Cambridge in colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert Roh@@ format Pictures in JPEG or T@@ IF@@ F with the Roh@@ mer Converter of &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; you can find further information on the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ um . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; supports the loading of Roh@@ bil@@ ites only with the program d@@ cra@@ w that supported in &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; all of them support cameras can be seen below the web page by Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw ingredients that are supported by &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; supported by :

the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates to the met@@ ad@@ ata of a picture and the geographical data are stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the picture and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alise images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itud@@ inal and lat@@ itude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ related your pictures with ge@@ ographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window , and call the menu . to download a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you &apos;ll need to upload a trace file with GP@@ X file , of course , you need to have a trace file with GP@@ X file , like the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , automatic correlation is performed in red . GPS trace data are recorded at GMT @-@ time and therefore , the camera must be converted with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone . put here your camera zone . &quot;
&quot; the default setting for the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera care . the deviation of the deviation below is the data . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a trace data from a place , you can edit the GP@@ X file manually and add to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all pictures in this area . &quot;
&quot; the options of inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have a matching data . if you know that in reality a location in a large difference between camera and GPS , you can put this limits here and then cor@@ relate to the button . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set up with this dialog . this is useful if you have set a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next time , you only need to use the button OK to set the data with the current picture . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map after and to be found . select the relevant region and enlar@@ ges it again . the amount must always be selected , the card can always be changed manually . the card can always be changed manually . the card can be changed manually . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the ex@@ if@@ tool used to have a stack of images with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages , and select the parameters for HTML pages . the character set will be encoded UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be adapted to HTML . these albums are not allowed to select all albums . these albums are not allowed to select a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the alarm show and the text of the text will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each side . this rider is largely expl@@ or@@ ating . the option for each image will create a page . otherwise , the picture will be displayed on a picture . otherwise , the picture will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your associated pictures . choose a folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the standard colour depth . of course , the file size is also expl@@ ain@@ able . all other settings are expl@@ ain@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider pre@@ dic@@ ate allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider , which are small pictures that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress panel shows the user to how far the action is . press departure to break the process .
&quot; if the module creates the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to determine whether errors during the creation are started . the web browser is started automatically at the end to show the preview of the gallery . press links to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .

you must first select the pictures taken into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can use ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au to create the module .
the pictures selected by you will then count under image files in the portfolio . you can also change sorting the pictures and change the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are happy with your list , you should select the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . if you &apos;re planning to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the image process is specified below . a low value generates very sudden , a high contrast is very smooth . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set up next . in doubt , you should set them black . the name and path of the generated file can be set under name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g . &quot;
&quot; if you have an audio file under name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the film . after you can start all settings of your wishes , you can now go fast or in all peace you can drink a coffee and enjoy the di@@ asch@@ au , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages to the right below . &quot;
&quot; the print assistant allows you to print several pictures on a sheet paper , together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is for example to improve or print them with the Gim@@ p Module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import your favorite pictures stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IF@@ F or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . a original version of Him is : expect d@@ cra@@ w not that it &apos;s the same results as the software from your camera manufacturers . sometimes you get better results !
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file that will be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w @-@ picture converter window appears in mode for a single image . you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optim@@ ise the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings should be used for the White , brightness and Red / Blue amplifier . if the result is not optimal , you can further edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so you can use the contra@@ diction . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JPEG use is equal and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG is used for a loss of loss used algorithm . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image Format , T@@ IF@@ F , maintains all information of your image and uses the loss @-@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use JPEG format , as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . T@@ IF@@ F and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as memory format , the met@@ ad@@ ata will be included in the RA@@ W file in JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information . &quot;
&quot; if you adapted your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can use this process . &quot;
&quot; the forkli@@ ft processing mode allows you to convert different pictures to one time . use this mode therefore if you are safe , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical with the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to write existing file automatically . it &apos;s helpful if this is not available in an earlier attempt . a preview of progress is not available as far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all pictures in an album . it uses the program from Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick Package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set up the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp to be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the image of the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image of the image or enlarge . these are four types of the change to be available :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the picture orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . this option remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adapt your picture to screen size .
not proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed in this option .
&quot; preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target picture , including background size , length and background colour is adapted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected images with your preferred E @-@ mail program . it is possible to change the size of the images in advance . further images can go to the list of the images and place there . &quot;
&quot; after you started the module , the pictures window will be displayed by the selected images . you can add more images using a file sharing dialog . for the last selected image you selected a preview page is displayed on the right side . &quot;
you can also draw pictures on the picture list and put them in order to add some of the list of images .
&quot; with the button images , the selected pictures are removed from the list of images of too sen@@ sel@@ ess pictures . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected all the pictures , you can open the new message from your e @-@ mail clients with the button . you need to add only the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sen@@ sel@@ ess e @-@ mails . you may have a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window will be used to change the settings for the image of the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you have to specify in the input field below the right path for your installation . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you need to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before you can download this here . &quot;
&quot; after the choice of comments in a requested file , the comments on the pictures will be merged into a text file and added the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format below the menu file format file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the loss @-@ free formats such as T@@ IF@@ F . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you do not have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you are JPEG photos file format and select the original files in JPEG format , then the original Ex@@ if@@ data will be added to sen@@ sel@@ ess pictures . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can view the status messages , looking for errors , can be started automatically at the end . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . using the button , you can lie down this window ? en . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you have presented your Di@@ asch@@ au . you can choose from selected and select all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transfers in the presentation is enabled , using Open@@ GL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the Di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the pictures are displayed in the left corner during the presentation .
&quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an endless loop , you can then break it manually with Es@@ c . &quot;
the option pictures randomly select that the pictures is displayed in a random sequence . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
&quot; under delay between the pictures , the tim@@ ely distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , this is the most important distance to show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random by any transition between the pictures you choose another effect .
&quot; during Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left side edge . move the mouse into this corner to turn off . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar you can hold the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left side screen , you can see the current date name , the position of the current picture and the entire number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of K@@ IP@@ I Teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ men@@ ü@@ s , as the background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut ; see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the picture we are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group sample entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information as you have created your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard disk , and of course the current pre@@ dic@@ tive images . in the following is described each for themselves . &quot;
&quot; if you press with the mouse on the record , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person only the pictures are displayed , on which both persons are displayed . by this selection method , you can restri@@ ct the number of pictures shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view the images of your active section . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can store with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person , store your own image , this is of course also for locations , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture . &quot;
&quot; to show pictures beside the name , select the button , which is located right outside on the tool bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . please note that you can not have symbols with images of persons and simultaneously a list of sample words ( if you do not have a suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must have to set the image for every single person is to be displayed . in order to view this , you &apos;ll need to adjust the image editing window . now you can adjust the image for the corresponding person . in the transparent window you can adjust the enlargement factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you call the main window in the main window , a dialog will show you a look at the dialog for setting the image properties very similar . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field label or description , the labelling and descriptions of the pictures are searched for this text . if you want , you can also select a date of the total data , so for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images in particular name as well as you can see in the picture . here it will be shown in pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; this is the user &apos;s book for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read hand@@ books , but rather like to try functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and look at the fast @-@ up , the screen photos and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut album ; and select in the first dialog the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry , or select a few example of images , and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try out . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom edge of the head of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the time bar . a picture of this ep@@ ress can see here : . as the name suggests , this glue shows you data @-@ statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . every LEICA displays a different unit . you can see a database between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be inter@@ actively using the following ways : you can select the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , you will always show the first picture of this date in preview picture ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images , if you can navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of time bar by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse via the Lin@@ e@@ al of the time bar , so the time data is displayed . you can break the selection , by clicking on a bar of the time bar . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML websites with your images . it is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module is available ( see ) . in the following part of the user &apos;s book , it is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version , which you can create about the menu file HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages , you &apos;ll need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following each section , each section is described . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of over@@ looked and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo@@ album ; HTML example pages , you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file is supposed to be seen on the reviews page . nour@@ ishing information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information on the HTML pages will be displayed . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed without description . for example , all images of a party are evident . for example , all pictures are exported . you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain viewing . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most import@@ ation options are definitely , which is not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . this means you have to look at your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800x600 , no pictures download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewing of your site can change the resolution at any time . he can browse your pictures with a lower resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time , as well . if he would like to get a picture above , it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting range , you place the different folder and URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best for all your HTML files , choose a basic file and for each subsequent set , choose a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder , in which all your pictures are stored . this folder will be stored in the next time . this folder allows you to select any folder or a K@@ DE backup protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this really is visible to viewer . if you have created a web browser after the pages have been created , this folder should be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy it manually . so the import function , see , correct , you &apos;ll need to specify the final goal of the files , but the basic file in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the setting options described above have all three on basic file or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder laid out , whose name will set you in the output file . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut , you may want to add a HTML page to viewing the images . you may have a lot of time for viewing the pictures , recording place , etc . you can &apos;t even do this work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work is not even done . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others in your database . the image features are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in the file itself or whether the pictures are stored in the file , or if you can have all the images into the file , you can add all the images into the file . the obvious down@@ side is , however , the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the pictures to two times . first you seek images that have specified in the file of .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , you will find the images of the file that you will have created your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog is described for exp@@ orting images you can exp@@ orting the menu file ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it is to act on internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three selection options are available :
&quot; in the manual of the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the pictures in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the Autom@@ atically option to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures are automatically generated for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to compressed this , simply select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you would like to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each image should be 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you can import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from web browser or from the menu file , it will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exp@@ orting database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the assistant to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select what images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are person@@ able to imported the category people to the imported file , while this category is to be imported into your database . therefore , you will be asked to be imported in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialogue window , and what categories are to be imported in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of to imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it simply needs to be easy to browse pictures and watch : when you see pictures , you often want to look inside of different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to discover pictures of your Italy holiday and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures , on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the various steps from ( 1 ) fixed the information about your images , via ( 2 ) the searches and look , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ table possibilities . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it takes care of your videos . at many places in this manual you have spoken about images , but frequently , this also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can copy with a program of your choice , e.g. Normal securing tools , copying on a disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut album ; see the folder when your pictures are stored and used this with future restart automatically . if you want to read another folder in &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut , so you can start a different folder tree with images , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option -@@ c ~ / company / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; set up the menu entry / photo@@ debut album ; set up to a window , with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut , which can be explained in the following section of the user &apos;s version . &quot;
&quot; on the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call setup possibilities for preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , you can call an extensive help you can call on the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you as you can create different characteristics , e.g. people , locations and tags . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; you can see the dialog that is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a label and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories were mentioned earlier . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ ator like in explained . &quot;
&quot; you can see the setup possibilities , which are available to you for the fixed list of members . in the left window , you can select the list with the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; divi@@ des his mod@@ ulation system with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this mod@@ ulation system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plu@@ gin Interface . nour@@ ishing information for this information on the website of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called via the menu modules . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have an aid page which you can call over the module itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules used by several applications together , can be used to test the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can always test new modules with the command &gt; &quot; &quot; photo@@ debut album &quot; &quot; demo &lt; us@@ er@@ ect \ &gt; or via the menu assistance . don &apos;t say , I don &apos;t have been warned ! &quot;
&quot; applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order is not supported for some modules which can use the order for some albums , so you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulated &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all images that show you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s brows@@ ers the contents of a category , for example , all people , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the dialog dialog category as a category for virtual albums , so if you have chosen the category people , be selected &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut , so if you were selected persons to view this and pass the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select the modules that modules are loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example for a starting screen , once you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut ; starting with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you have used it from any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top of a menu and a tool@@ bar . at the moment we will not see any information about your pictures . in the section we &apos;ll show you on this window , but now click on the record images that shows you an overview of all existing pictures . &quot;
one of the main features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to view any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who have shown on the picture above . you can see each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures specific notes at the same time . if it is depicted on all pictures of Jes@@ per and all pictures were taken in Copenhagen .
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and brow@@ ses , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in a look at three lists with a text box by setting persons , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the shift of pictures within the list : if you are shown for example a family party , and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people can be moved , so you can find the names faster and arrange them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer an ill@@ iter@@ ated list , click on the symbol for sorting after date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and adjust these images with notes . Click in this case simply to the preview of the picture right upstairs . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these pictures and use the menu of multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the Planning dialog@@ s , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ load or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also put an entry into a category to make this entry into a sub@@ category of this entry . note that you &apos;ll just sort your categories alphabetical order . see also . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the table dialog@@ s by clicking the vest that make the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by setting it out outside the window range . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the window of the window to your needs , click on the button options , click on the button options ... , which provides you among other things the opportunity to save the current design and the appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can leave a frame even complete . if you want to display this window later , use the button options ... and here you can see a / out window . see this process you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the record images in your browser , you will receive an overview of the selected images , or all pictures if you have no filters . you can see the size of the scre@@ wing , by simply plug@@ ging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you have set a picture on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , this picture will be displayed in the picture . if you still have no window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the picture display . simply choose the corresponding pictures you want to delete , and select either the removal button or select either the menu button . now you will see the window , which you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut album ; for this problem , you can also use a solution . you can also use images anywhere , without you to have stored on the hard disk . of course you have to see the pictures anywhere , so you can see the pictures from the hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures of the hard disk can be loaded . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , however , these images are present , so that they can view the preview of these images . however , you can see these images not with the picture . &quot;
&quot; as you see , this function requires files from the folders and copy it again . &amp; k@@ photo@@ debut ; if you don &apos;t want to avoid the setup of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the menu Pictures , you will find a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you filter the pictures that you can see for other un@@ accessible and click on the view of privacy . alternatively , you can also see all the pictures you can see your little sister , communic@@ ating and select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; with this , you have set what images in the case of the barrel should be hidden . if you have set the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry , which will simply select the pictures you have blocked , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to determine a password , which must be entered for un@@ lock the images . in order to set up this password , just select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please note that this picture protection is not very safe . for example , all pictures on the hard disk and the other can be read or delete this type of password protection . this type of password protection can only read or delete this type of password protection . not very familiar to the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours , of course , that you want to look at some point . from this reason , it has a picture _ and video viewer . this is why you can start from a preview of how described in . &quot;
&quot; to see the viewer you can see . he shows the picture , but additional all the information you enter on the picture , such as who is on the picture , where and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to see the Info@@ box on the top part of the picture you want , so you can also configure that easily with the mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether all of these options are displayed after a right click on the viewer . the next step menu can be seen below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , your browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can easily switch between them and go back by using the buttons high and image . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run this as a di@@ asch@@ au . and then a new picture invites you to press a new picture by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or Min@@ us . it will be stopped and stopped by the C@@ tr@@ l keys ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability to change from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input button to change in full screen mode and back .
if you can use the viewer in the picture and zo@@ oming in the picture . you can easily pull out a rectangle with the mouse button . shows the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a Zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
&quot; with the point key , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not zo@@ omed . with the equ@@ alization , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel image of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations will work with videos that are in and out @-@ zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and Min@@ u@@ st@@ aste . &quot;
&quot; with the set menu from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current picture with the menu option from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you can see pictures , you can see a picture with a person whose name you &apos;ll have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog of the image to check this name . but you may see only the picture to mark and see more images . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the pictures and watch them as good or bad , while you &apos;ll see one after the other . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view pictures featuring features , while you view it . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature that you can express the corresponding letters . in a look at the characteristics A , B and C . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , you are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you choose to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and special features can be displayed in the view of view . if you can view the categories in D@@ re Pre @-@ view , then you can add the features to the images by simply select the letter for the feature , after the picture was selected . this can see here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture paint .
&quot; the brick is not stored with the image , but in the database . on the way you can make your common way back . &quot;
&quot; in a picture , you can see a picture on the painting . in order to switch the painting of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture paint from the context menu . to finish the painting you simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar above on the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able , you have to have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully @-@ rule , but documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you be read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire @-@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select several objects at the same time , but not the object of a already selected object , since all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object to the object @-@ tree , select the position , to which you want to insert and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are multiple possible positions , the following folding menu will be built , so you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ e@@ tion , either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have properties changed , click on application to adopt these changes . if you have invali@@ d values , you will have a message with a error description . then you can click the input error or dis@@ card changes . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; to edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the stereotype property view . &quot;
&quot; press a preview of the stereotype property view and a small example of the scene will have selected the whole texture , even if you want to ren@@ dering a texture in texture map ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture @-@ map ) , cross locally . &quot;
the screen photo shows the control points of the camera . you can drag this control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and it will disappear a small cross in the wire model view . this cross is marked the center for sc@@ aling and turning as well as the position for shifts and turning the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a wire model . you can specify this value relatively to the above @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed if they are selected or their visibility level , or equal to the selected appearance of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like to connect the standard window , or if you need any other arrangement , you can also save them any number . you can also store several shut@@ ters and simply change between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to en@@ roll a window over or under a present view , drag the letter to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , head to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view , and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views on each other , draw the An@@ sat@@ er in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views to the cart@@ on map above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are floating : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the attachment to the work@@ space or click on the little to the left @-@ pointing arrow in the shape bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the facade bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you can find entries for any type of views . new views are sh@@ atter@@ ing , you can be found at any point . &quot;
&quot; you can save the current window view , save the window . it will store a dialog in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ dering them . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ dering , this program has to be installed properly . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click the symbol Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to insert a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can easily insert many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview of to full@@ ness in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon of the tool@@ bar in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name any name , but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size , you can enter the width and height of the rounded image . if you only want to ren@@ dering a small area of the image , select the cross section and enter the picture section to the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection @-@ lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features you can find in the user &apos;s manual for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is drawn with only a beam per pixel , different mistakes can be created . these pictures often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or stu@@ b effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are in the representation smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally you see pictures with this property better .
&quot; if you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and links &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as a standard , an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because the super sampling is adjacent to the neighboring Pix@@ um . the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel becomes more split and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sion@@ ing loop depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray followed a beam per pixel . if the difference between color values are calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling , a grid value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) will be charged additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference is divided between the following threshold values , the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel , then the pixels will be checked and further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn off J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last adjustment for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this card card , you can adjust whether the alpha @-@ channels will be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly completed , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; select the menu file , select the file import ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
currently &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able does not support &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; however not the complete command @-@ scale of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when import@@ ing errors or war@@ nings appear a dialogue window will show a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
&quot; you can export objects from the object tree to the editor to import the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it adds the source code in the editor to import , mark simply the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and insert into &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also to insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; a scene is ren@@ ounced . usually this is P@@ ov@@ ray or x @-@ P@@ ov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on help in the stereotype property , opens &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . please click here the path to your document re@@ ten@@ tion and the version . supported versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example al@@ fel@@ dd@@ aten ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you refer to files that are not in the file of the scene , you &apos;ll also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the view@@ point in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristics .
&quot; you can set the object of points on the button in the context menu of the wire model views . you can adjust the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turning . &quot;
&quot; larger values indicate a more accurate wire model and thus a better way for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detailed level for two directions . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the high detail space for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . this feature makes a better approach for projections , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; when you cross a wall , a wall is drawn behind the objects . the wall is depicted in a chess boards from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the bottom , a floor below is drawn underneath the objects . the floor is depicted in a chess boards made of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you check edge production , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for ren@@ dering scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be adjusted . more information about parameters you can find in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window arrangements . in section window orders will be explained as you can create window arrangements and store . &quot;
the combination field standard window order : shows all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; used the chosen window order at the start of the program .
the list of handwritten window arrangements shows all existing window arrangements . a new arrangement allows you to add and delete a selected arrangement with the button .
any window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all views of the chosen window order . new views can be updated with the button adding and remove selected views with the button .
&quot; create the position of the new window . with a new column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with un@@ locking , you will receive a cart@@ card view together with the previous view and not@@ ing the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; and now you want to follow without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should use the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should remember the following war@@ nings , before you complain about that you can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not adjust a camera , no rules can be applied for ren@@ dering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you add no light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you will receive only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything faul@@ t@@ less installed , you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; the following pre @-@ set window order : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can expect an appropriate idea what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and also their use . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you &apos;ll first need to remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and select the menu entry . therefore , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees all the scene you generate . in particular , notice the scene from the view of the camera . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this is the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now includes a new entry with the name camera . if they click on , see the content of the object properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can find . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; please find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change the camera in the view point , with which you can change the camera in view of the camera . just click on the left button and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press button or button button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change this settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view@@ point of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you might add a Qu@@ ader ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a reverse method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; indeed offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level than ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and press the button for the button or button . in the object tree , the new name is displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is now also the level , even at the moment only as limited infinite level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the plane turns out to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking to the object @-@ tree exactly , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object . in this case you can see the various parameters of the object . in this case you will find only the options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the object properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to introduce its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose a little one at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please choose the name in the property @-@ tree ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button . see how pig@@ ment looks now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only need to enter a sheet black material because you need to check settings for the pig@@ ment . do not remember that you can check the color of materials at any time with a click here . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the sim@@ pl@@ est now . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t look at a preview of color on Qu@@ ader and ball , click on the button use and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you ren@@ dering your picture now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the colour . you need to enter two new attributes . in the color list you need to set two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the box color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select any time and change the colors in the view of the object properties : &quot;
&quot; this step should already be able to run , since you should have understood the basic work of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able . the ball is just as easy to create as the floor : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . put the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or button to press ) , so the ball over the ground is floating , because you have moved the floor around a unit down below . &quot;
&quot; of course , Ren@@ dering now gives a strange result : as previously seen , the ball @-@ surface seems like a sheet black material . put a suitable material in the following step . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now as@@ sign a material now . like the bottom , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select the bottom object and change the name for example in sphere pig@@ ment . Click the ball Pig@@ ment , then select one color , and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , when you take the time to introduce some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on application or push the input button .
&quot; the settings of radi@@ ance effect and reflection are already some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; offers . hopefully , you have already learned that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you ra@@ ged a scene , the Ren@@ derer has hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflect the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and how atmospheric effects of light sources in the scene and as atmospheric effects as for example . thus , the scene is mach@@ ined pixels for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you can see nothing , the picture is simple black . obviously every scene needs to be cut , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select one file , which you have previously created with &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ sk@@ er ; created &quot;
&quot; whenever you can open a new model or create , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it is stored under the same name . is it a new file , you need to enter a name and storage space . &quot;
exhibits the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been rejected .
&quot; for this menu entry , you can only select if you haven &apos;t stored any changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeat the last back@@ log command . in this menu entry , you can only select if you use editing . &quot;
&quot; stores the current window arrangement , and opens a dialog in which you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you will find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; , here you can change the appearance , key@@ chains and the default behavior . &quot;
opening a dialog to change the keyboard abbrevi@@ ations . you can change the short command commands for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ model@@ er ; -@@ commands or adding new option .
opening a dialog to the establishment of tool@@ bars . you can add the tool &apos; tool &apos; tool for &amp; k@@ p@@ ov@@ able ; -@@ commands to add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to pre@@ dic@@ ate rough finishes without any b@@ eu@@ le on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is usual to use the same file for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture @-@ map .
basic body are simple geomet@@ rical forms that you can use as a building block : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then be processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture @-@ map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using a picture file as color card .
&amp; B@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture @-@ right and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the picture or in full screen .
the use of &amp; ball show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
&quot; you can adjust whether every picture is displayed in a own window , or whether all pictures are always using the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a certain file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a password fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file is highlighted by pressing of Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set up in dialogue - &amp; ball show ; there are five boxes cards . in three of them , General and editing and sli@@ deshow , you can set the work of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ ness ; set in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key@@ chains can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full screen mode . if the picture is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area filled with the background colour , which allows you to set down below . default is not a full screen . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ball show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still see the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next picture , and is especially suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; ball show ; when running the name of the recently opened folder . the next start opens &amp; ball show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; to select a background colour in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode , the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can also set &amp; ball show , so that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
&quot; using this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen . this option is switched on . &quot;
determines if the sli@@ deshow can begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image changes in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , the sli@@ deshow is repeated long as long as it is repe@@ ating from the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; change the key@@ chains for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the card , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can switch between the second part of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays great symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short notice .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short notice .
displays reading images for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short notice .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
virtually enlar@@ ges the picture by 10 % . the factor is based on the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ball show ; also closed if no browser window is open .
show the picture in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
&quot; open the input field for completion . enter the first sign of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo processing based on &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; image editing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; project .
photo photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; it &apos;s an open source project , an open source project . it is dependent on that the user has to join its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; photo photo ; makes it as simple as possible mistakes or possible improvements . wherever you use this program , your browser has a page with a link to reports and wishes . all necessary information is already fulfilled , and you can simply follow the instructions to release your message . &quot;
&quot; photo photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you want to answer any more common users of &amp; show photo , but then we would like to answer any questions of other users . in this mailing list , English spoken , you should be mighty in this language . &quot;
the best start to participate in &amp; show photo ; to participate in the developer mailing list . instruction to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show photo ; .
&quot; photo photo ; try to give you much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options to access this settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols on the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the range of exposure indicators you can select the color , which is displayed if the sub@@ - or over@@ bel@@ ong@@ ation di@@ k@@ ator should display the colors with what you should show , in contrast , should display a bright color and exposure of a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show photo ; owns a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find this page , in which you can click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; Me@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan pictures that doesn &apos;t make more than images to scan and drain .
&quot; &amp; channels l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan pictures , which do not make more than pictures to scan , and save images in a specified file with automatically generated names and format . users can also see images in front of the specified file and save images in front of the image . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner at the san@@ e project page by check the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / C@@ GI @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channels ; with the command , l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; can be set in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog box is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . stop and finish the scanner ; finish .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; channels l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to add a picture , the user can only start a pre@@ f@@ lin@@ can and then sc@@ roll the scan for the final scan . the preview can be started by a preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , users can select in the picture and out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview in the window fits . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen a preview of preview in the settings , then the picture is pressed in a lecture window as shown below , then the picture is stored and lie down ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you enter into the main window . &quot;
through the button settings the same name will be opened before the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; users can consider the image if desired , before saving . in this case the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview of user is not desired , the option must be cho@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type of &amp; channels ; pictures stores to select . dialog for each image opens up the dialog before each one @-@ sc@@ anned picture . if &amp; channels l@@ ite , then you &apos;ll need to ask yourself with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you &apos;ll need to ask yourself without a file name . &quot;
&quot; this setting is defined where the pictures are stored at option without using a file name . if the pictures are stored on any scan , this folder will be used as standard for dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically stored pictures and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog . automatically stored , a numer@@ ical search mix of every time is uploaded when a picture is stored . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; users can adjust the image quality to store image quality . this value does not change the compression value when you select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help kick off the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channels ; -@@ manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE about -@@ dialog for &amp; channels ; . the button settings will be used to end the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; string .
&quot; &amp; channels l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L , and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library , used by &amp; channels ; is used under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs key@@ chains . below you can select a list of these pump@@ zel and their function . select a list of these cuts in the player window and select Global Tast@@ ing . select the &amp; amar@@ ok ; select the mouse button in the player window and set short commands ... select .
you may be able to set up existing multimedia keys so that they will work as &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ short command work . therefore make your keyboard to &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ Control Centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are mostly in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts , and shall describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , play@@ list , play@@ lists , play@@ list , play@@ list , play@@ list and scripts ; look like this : &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok still has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be implemented due to any lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are available , and use the dialog box , with the user reference to why a script doesn &apos;t run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ in@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings V@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the file scripts / Tem@@ plates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as basis for your own scripts or simply to determine the necessary functions . they will quickly find that the writing is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ COP , your scripts can control your scripts with Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is using the command d@@ co@@ p ; which should be used any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scripts they enable external programs and commands . for this purpose , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called ex@@ ec &gt; relatively easy to use . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and according to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the setup dialog . for storing and loading data , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok should be stored on the folders where all data should be stored . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is played . the script might be played &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP features further information about the new piece ( for example , met@@ ad@@ ata or the unit length ) . &quot;
&quot; volume change : volume signals , a change in volume . the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100 . &quot;
custom@@ men@@ u@@ cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ap . you &apos;ll also add the path to the selected files of the play@@ list . you can also add the script file d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script scri@@ pt@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ap ) to remove one entry . you can use d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script , e@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ ap ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; amar@@ ok ends , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do , for example , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ oks script management can also install script packages that can be downloaded with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) , which can also be seen with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Extended amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and link to the Viking scripts side of &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the category amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply move music into the play@@ list instead of endless menus . maybe you can also find a completely certain title of thousands of your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collector browser and quick search will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you have already some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ list browser needs exactly the right thing for you . and if you are still difficult , choose dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music by certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Rivers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used , such as you want to hear your music . these and many more useful features make Amar@@ ok to the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and sch@@ ick - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter the Fol@@ ok sources in the base file of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have trouble when you encounter problems . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; as most applications have some options , which can activate or de@@ activate the comp@@ ile point with the configure script or de@@ activate . this is a list of available options . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled , so they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates de@@ bug@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help at the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should use full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set without effort beyond the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several cardboard cards to set up the various features of &amp; amar@@ ok .
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;
use : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar has been compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
&quot; impressive : this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , this function is modified for m@@ ood@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , this function is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings file of &amp; amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external brows@@ ers : lets you choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok is to be started when a browser is needed .
use other brows@@ ers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not located in the list .
play@@ list automatically stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; . dis@@ able this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list .
&quot; relative paths for manually re@@ play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , you will use &amp; amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , based on the play@@ site of play@@ list . otherwise , the absolute position of music files are stored . &quot;
&quot; in the piece of replacement changes , the play@@ list window opens up / off to keep the play@@ list always in the visible window range . &quot;
&quot; when changes to the context @-@ browser changes , the context @-@ browser automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the appearance , you can adjust &amp; amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is part in three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can select the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; amar@@ ok ; otherwise you can select scripts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ browser . press on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the set @-@ defined color sch@@ ema , you have set the quota of choice and can set up a color scheme . use the below color chosen for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; play back at the start , that &amp; amar@@ ok ; after the program start , playback automatically starts automatically with the piece at the point where it was stopped . &quot;
&quot; the lower @-@ window on screen display allows you to use the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of O@@ SD is displayed and you can consider the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD , which is shown by the text in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; your own colours are available to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on color surfaces opens the dialog box selection . if your colors are not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the input field display text is displayed in the O@@ SD text . by type of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can set up on which screen will be a multi @-@ way monitor setting on the O@@ SD . &quot;
the audio card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers activate further adjustment possibilities in this box card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the file , the &amp; amar@@ ok ; to browse the files in the collection . in order to include a folder into the collection , check the check box in addition to its name . this section includes access fields , as with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; as well : this causes that &amp; amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder , as well as their sub@@ folder after music . &quot;
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. music files added , or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is done to make the necessary changes in your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : causes &amp; amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will be added later in the play@@ list browser .
&quot; the part of the collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : allows you to select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , additional facility in the bottom window is required . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL facility is used for adjust@@ ing the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; used under calcul@@ ator : if the calcul@@ ator is entered , on which the database port is entered , under which the database is accessed . name : is the database name to which the connection is manufactured . &quot;
use us@@ ername : and password : enter the data required for the database connection to the database .
the cart@@ on card loaded ( f@@ m ) sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can produce the names of played pieces on a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations on the current piece .
&quot; here , enter your user name and password for your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register one on the loaded .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the split pieces to your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar Inter@@ pre@@ ten : after activ@@ ating this setting &amp; amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ts to each piece . note : you can use the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a loaded .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in summary of functions and gallery with screen photos .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K requires only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including those contained programs , because &amp; amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) , as you have a small guide , how to compiled k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD account that your window managers are holding the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work for such difficulties . we try to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this error in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log file . afterwards you can delete this error to the crash . afterwards you can delete the file and allow the collection again .
mostly that Tag@@ lib in reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system crashing : please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , please try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok were compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , this leads to crash when editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d , then dis@@ able autom@@ ating machine . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace of e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically open at a crash ) . if it is often a common crash , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that many programme write data as UTF @-@ 8 into met@@ a @-@ information , but these are not as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; &quot; -@@ f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; my $ v@@ 2@@ Day = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the MP3 @-@ module MP3 : : Mp@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects can be forgotten in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click status disabled to grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times you need to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
&quot; if you receive this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ Systems Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if am@@ aro@@ K can see the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p Q@@ T . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most inst@@ ances are on ligh@@ test through the help of an expert your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or developers . they can also use the Forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the Canal # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please carry out there only an error if you are looking for a bug in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; only a blank play@@ list . how do music pieces come in ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired file . then drag the files into the right part of the play@@ list .
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start @-@ window was converted into the statistic window . you &apos;ll find it under ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by users , while the points will be calculated automatically . &quot;
&quot; to evaluate it , it must be displayed in the play@@ list of the play@@ list and select column column . Click anywhere in the new evaluation column to determine the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then click on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and choose from play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; draw a play@@ list file with the mouse in the play@@ list and leave them there , just as you would like to do it with other files . this is easy : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , directly next to the button , click the button play@@ list . Click on it . &quot;
probably you are missing the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the package X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; amar@@ ok ; new . look at lib@@ aries , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the Equali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) , and also find it over the menu bar under ex@@ tras equ@@ ali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s really true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . how you can see , we can even support lyrics and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it may be ! maybe you use Fed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , where@@ with the default , no MP3 decoder can be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ ative reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , Ex@@ ab@@ et@@ aste &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device must use a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and use audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) . see the Help D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and a solution . for G@@ stre@@ amer you might need to specify another S@@ ink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) .
&quot; that does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media should be encoded with AL@@ SA . G@@ stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; even X@@ M@@ MS de@@ coded the data . G@@ stre@@ amer can spend directly on AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of the Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound@@ server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ ide is set : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x , there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia Code@@ cs , which can cause problems . read this error report . reading the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setting file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia completely to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crash@@ es &amp; amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . do you register @-@ register for pre @-@ register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( end am@@ aro@@ K before ! ) : - Store you down ff@@ m@@ peg , comp@@ ile and install it . then delete the module file from G@@ stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module file with you @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config file ) and run a register . then start &amp; amar@@ ok . &quot;
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of proposals / wishes you send them best to our mailing list : amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net

&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and allow the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command leaves &amp; amar@@ ok ; play sure that &amp; amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened from the gentle tones of music that you have stopped in front of the bed . &quot;
how to experience the current in &amp; amar@@ ok ; running in a different computer ?
&quot; if a functional SSH area is present , you can proceed as follows : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user re@@ us@@ ername amar@@ ok player &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and my us@@ ername with your user name . it assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is present .
&quot; visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; amar@@ ok ; press windows . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changed window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights Mau@@ st@@ aste makes a piece in the queu@@ e sequence in the waiting time . by pressing the input button after a search in the play@@ list the first search results are played and the search returned .
&quot; OK , the player window and the play@@ list have tri@@ ck@@ able functions , but how does it look with the symbol in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;

my personal file $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of am@@ aro@@ K the collection database can not be created and the console appear many errors . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; amar@@ ok ; doesn &apos;t work with NFS . either you need ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok on a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K@@ s MySQL support .
&quot; place the CD , then click on the menu on audio CD . it opens up a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading you &apos;ll pick up a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . automatically add files from folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the basic file of the CD .
&quot; this is a comfortable method , recently opened projects again . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; the current project saves the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked after a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save below is displayed , using the file and file name for the project file . &quot;
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each single project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has happened . you can then choose between saving and changes . besides , you can also cancel the switch and keep the project so opened . &quot;
&quot; includes all the opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for any un@@ stored project , what has happened to happen , just as you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all the opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project , what should happen , as if you would have called the file . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select the following dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect when using the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so @-@ added files appear in the basic file of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened when the project has already included data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many projects related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are the ? -@@ Help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this is useful if you &apos;re not used to import files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s more important for you to see files already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this entry appears only for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function is set &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; , imported files from the current project . all other files are removed from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD copy dialog . this also allows the copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a copy of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also prefer to copy a CD with defective sectors or video CDs if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this also allows you to create a DVD copy . this also allows you to burn a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD with the help of copying dialog . moreover , you can also receive a DVD with the help of copying dialog . moreover , the target medium has to be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source code in the original form . &quot;
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW disc . you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive .
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , whereby the content will be deleted completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose the choice between the writing modes and in@@ cre@@ ment@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; if you use a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported yet , you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
bur@@ ns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you after a * .@@ is@@ o file as data source , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; an earlier DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window will usually be used after reading a DVD in the ingredients , but can also be used as well as possible . it contains information about the yellow video , co@@ dic@@ er@@ settings and even possibilities to change the size and cut in black edges . &quot;
&quot; shows information about the set media . this information is shown in the content view and include characteristics of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; displays a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is crossed , a small dead at the bottom of the window will be displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; the folder view is a or out . the folder view is activated , and the print view is activated , whose content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also a context menu with functions such as media info , blocking , and un@@ locking of the drive or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; switches the ingredients on a or out . the ingredients may choose out and draw files into the projection view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view was selected . &quot;
&quot; the cou@@ ghing in the project view is a narrow area that contains a narrow area that is only visible when the projection screen has open projects . the Cop@@ ying has no real function , it looks very pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the key arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard assignment below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup assist@@ ants . thus , the correct per@@ missions are required to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , therefore you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general program settings can be made . almost all features of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should be functioning at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alise and fine adjustment of the program . &quot;
&quot; like many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a Sh@@ ell@@ scription . &quot;
&quot; in order to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or something more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are the same as your taste and the kind of tasks are crucial to pass , which will give you to the input programs . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you can use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions need to make sure you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following in the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions that have common &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts , which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and further features to create new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref Ch@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id Car@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) Vo@@ id Cop@@ at@@ D@@ vd ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ dr@@ w ( ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you can create a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d , and then a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface curr@@ ent@@ Project Through using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the top listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which is applicable only to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; Vo@@ id creamy Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id creamy Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id add@@ Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ String trail , Q@@ String ) e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id Ja@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id Superior Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) , Q@@ at@@ id Vol@@ um@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) &quot;
&quot; it is possible to fill out a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy Fol@@ der : d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creamy Fol@@ der / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT add@@ Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ eg / for fil@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ le@@ reader for &amp; K@@ DE ; available with him can easily be saved audio CD ; s out and be saved in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder of the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and many co@@ di@@ ers used to code these WAV files . more co@@ ers can still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , this WAV files ( usually one per title ) is compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats like the loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , read the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) must be installed for the second step . all these programs are already installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , but it is not necessary to comp@@ ile anything but needed . if F@@ LA@@ C does not need to be used , its installation is not necessary . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ aser / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction on Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compres@@ sive factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , uses &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not available to avoid any copy protection . in any case , it is not possible to deal with a protected audio CD ; it is not possible to deal with the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of head @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once more can only be done ( the setup dialog can be found so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , follow the daily handling of a &amp; CD ; this leads to the hard disk approach to the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert in many formats - depending on which Ko@@ di@@ ers installed programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can I get &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step for step example , further information , such as this program will be used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the program &apos;s configuration . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of CD@@ DB . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case first must first be connected to the internet . ) &quot;
&quot; starts reading and - when a Encoder is configured in the Code card , the encoding system was configured . &quot;
&quot; opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the standard . it is noted that before the Encoder is configured in the Code map settings in the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager so that a already chosen file is selected to code , instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of al@@ erts ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for pro@@ gram@@ ing events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; open the main meeting dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator , with different card cards ( such as encoder , to set the En@@ co@@ ders ) . this way you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ effici@@ ents and compression rates and helps you to choose the right Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should go lost , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other like &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can use these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , you lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and OGG are most common . OGG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ di@@ ers generate very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , lame will still be supplied with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license &quot;
&quot; + high to very high output quality ( at high bit@@ rate ) , but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rate . &quot;
OGG - if only music belongs to a computer or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG files are available .
&quot; MP3 - When music is also heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 , these devices are usually only MP3 format . &quot;
a short list with parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has already quite high quality . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of one title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a tit@@ els . good Gen@@ ug for music by adolescents , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have the absolute highest quality without any view of the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that can be entered manually or replaced by Free@@ DB via the internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed to create files and file names to create the folder and file names as well as the characteristics of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ di@@ er@@ programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the code and these parameters here . manual or help to the code explain the switch for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the key@@ word ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s can be encoded with lame must be added to the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ das ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } . &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; parameters that can be used ( = button of the presentation in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what Free@@ DB is : a free database , which can read the information up / enter , so that all the other information can download or enter into the calcul@@ ator . it is said that only from text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m. ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so the information can be added to the music company damage . all information can be stored in a bum@@ ble@@ bee by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active to select a check box in this type of configuration . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address is not used by the server ( this can only know the programmer , which has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date , the geographical server will be used for using Free@@ DB . this saves bandwidth in the network and is compar@@ ing the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit with fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online call of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which expressions is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to be more precise , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed first if this has not happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the read WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer and the desired file format can be selected . during the first opening , pre @-@ defined entries for audio data ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression for audio data ) can be found on this tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the relevant Linux distribution before the Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used . this is also necessary for the pre@@ defined co@@ di@@ ers . more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are located in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information about its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want to read a copy protected audio CD ; check the shell on &amp; CD ; it will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , all understood , but are somehow still uncertain what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ for @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time to read everything and write our first &amp; CD ; read &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; using MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key words ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be installed as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , as it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , which you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission on it ( eg ; by using the Kon@@ quer@@ or something to copy ) .
&quot; the first section deals with the basic set of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ ds , something that is probably done only once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which has to be repeated for each extension &amp; CD ; it has to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; here we determine the use of the code for compression of the music ( lame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use Free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not be able to read any &amp; CD at any time , if once the matching settings are found . &quot;
the device name is delivered to the reading program that can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive can also be accessed , so a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card card general settings . here you can &apos;t do much more . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be done and entered as shown in the screen picture . &quot;
&quot; only for full information please ask , so that you will be informed if details are missing for the creation of samples ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and can download the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet of a Free@@ DB computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading &amp; CD ; it can be connected to the Internet to access the Free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are un@@ happy with the database entry and date entries , you can easily be changed using the database entry and the ID3 tags with Kid@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ us . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , you dis@@ able the selection fields and Free@@ DB . however , this is worth 620 MB if you have to use it twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use Free@@ DB on off@@ lin@@ em@@ mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following map card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ DB server via the internet . how does the system you need to get the CD ? read the section about Free@@ DB . put everything as shown in the screen picture .
mode : we have not downloaded the database we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the side fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this track the load is distributed between the machines . this attitude will be as first attempt .
&quot; both function work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls of the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , as the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transfer &amp; CD ; data on Free@@ DB server . the first check box should be dis@@ able . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the file / tmp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at only one existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you enter this check , then the path / folders will be specified , if only space is stored on another drive . if the box is not checked , the files will not be checked , if you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; all such as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under circumstances , it must be bl@@ amed to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned before , it is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags on version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can be deleted if needed . Kid@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of subsequent change of Tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest as in screen photo . some comments for future use except this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously to be encoded WAV files : in a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ date . this configuration is used as a standard for any read one &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , which is organized as the music on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the CD ; data from Free@@ DB has to be saved . the process of which is described in this section , must be repeated for each extension &amp; CD ; it has to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we have a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in Free@@ DB , check the screen photos a little different from Free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually enter , instead of sending them from the Internet . comments are shown on the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author this hand@@ book .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD has to be defined now ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length are listed in the window , such as screen photo . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , you are looking for questions and answers to your help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been successfully picked up from Free@@ DB , all tracks are already fulfilled and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; for the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; available , a window will be built , and you can select the database entry , which is best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you do not have chosen the check box for the automatic query of Free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually redeem it by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you need access to the Internet . &quot;
E 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist doesn &apos;t have to be entered in the &apos; Update title &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the bottom comment field can be used for the individual comments of di@@ pp@@ ell per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments which apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from Free@@ DB , the CD Editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all the words with big letters will start or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ ired remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have set up an unlimited field of view ; this option will take a look at the Code &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files later at any time with the tag editor . Kid@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats , in the help of Ko@@ di@@ ers to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; simply choose one entry that is obvious with the style of the read CD ; this example is not important , since we don &apos;t want to transfer the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information on the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are to be found under rock . &quot;
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields are already filled with the specified data , which we have already recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . simply type the entries for each case and any other information you wish . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and procedure in the same way up to you all the cover data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from Free@@ DB . it is already sorted in one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ in before any line of each line . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or select the button all pieces select at the bottom edge of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the button selecting the reading process , this window appears to be confirmation . clicking OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; on the rider , click on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer you have not installed . pieces that are not successfully encoded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folders are not what we have entered in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the file for temporary files and the target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred right after the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of pieces 1 into the format MP3 . thus , check out the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings , to read this behavior . the only thing that configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the machine used with a am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem when simultaneously read and code ( however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is encoded , and a third order is encoded in the queu@@ e &apos;s queu@@ e . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message is built in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ iler , you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; today you can find an anonymous copy today within the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ise media package . however , you can already install an anonymous copy here . most distri@@ butions are already contained a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ rem ; one part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package is already done , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals , compiled by source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for help like the program your needs can be adjusted once , then it is the following correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations on settings . best read the step for step example to get the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options which are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still am reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any reference point like it &apos;s going on , from this somehow empty screen ( above all , if there is no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably has already started the program . it should look something like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author can &apos;t edit this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator . and if you read this , he has done this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if it has done you the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need this information but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and Kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er von &amp; K@@ DE ; in addition to others , it has with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ show texts of texts also some properties , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; K@@ DE ; so it also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asound project driver , which is supported for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by pressing the pressing buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so you can drag in &amp; K@@ DE ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows to K@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) .
&quot; if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the play@@ time of a song , K@@ Mid starts again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialogue with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also make a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; windows fall . this also works with multiple songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a music piece , open the button and play the button playing in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu , or enter the space button . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically , once you go to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows draw . ( in several pieces it will be added to a collection , and then re @-@ played one another . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any spot by using the middle button and drive with the kno@@ b . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the speed indicator . to get the original temp@@ o , click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space button has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the button for a button or select the menu entry into the menu , interru@@ pts the play . bet@@ ting the space while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
song tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a music piece . some pieces use text event and others use lyrics and other both . some pieces do not have any text : - )
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can adjust what events are supposed to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined that you need to manually set up a song , so you will still have the option to change this if you want to see the other kind if you want to see the other kind . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set a event type , select from the menu settings the entries text events or song events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you summar@@ ize . these are played by the series after you . in this section you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to put a collection , open the collection manager at first . see the menu collection under the point . Click New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then select the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set up the required item in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . remember if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the button . it appears in turn to select the file dialog , with which help you can choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting automation to the collection . &quot;
&quot; automatic adding to the collection is enabled , a piece of opening is automatically added to the active collection ( using file open or drag &amp; drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when auto add to the collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection will then be added to the continued pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you &apos;ll need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs can be played . if you select the series after the sub@@ menu of the menu sequence , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; add songs or remove songs or random order in the menu , the order is set . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection Manager , or use the selection list via the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song , next song from the menu , or push the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry pre@@ dict@@ ated pieces of the menu or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be er@@ ased . however , that doesn &apos;t matter if it is not stored at leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General MIDI events transl@@ ates into events that understands syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet , when originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ us cards , FM units and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand ( with your favorite se@@ dit@@ or ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications to play a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except that KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may often appear as desired . the requirement is , however , that each appearance is a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; A further key@@ map &quot; End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... End options ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can do in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the cartridge of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the balance sheet is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that will need this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported by a tissue ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which can do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( the drum ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which tone in the MIDI file stands . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term Tro@@ drum patch of the patch is meant , in which each tone represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ing instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and is not the one that means sound the sound level of the same drum ( like some keyboards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to give how tones are depicted on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple keyboards for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
keyboards are mainly used to form sounds on the per@@ k@@ ward channel . watch out as an example the supplied keyboards .
&quot; this section can be used to create some channels on others . if you want to change the first and the second channel , make it easy for the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards , which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map with the name is used for this channel . if you are using the key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is necessary to change the patch on this channel . if you &apos;re using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example to use the per@@ col@@ t patch on the per@@ k@@ ward channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates that in which proportion of Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if an MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event , this will be re@@ directed by the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then the value 40@@ 96 is used , thus in the map file no dec@@ imal places are used ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM is present that a keyboard , which is a Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der event will be playing with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , some keyboards to find two sounds up to a oct@@ ave higher . to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try to try . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI Map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the canal view is a window with a whole row of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these piano , you see what sounds are played straight . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the canal view ( until now ) has two different views to show the split tones . view in the menu settings under the point channel view : settings
&quot; the Tempo LCD displays the speed , which will be played with a song . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the temp@@ o of a song . if you find , a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the temp@@ o , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it , like a music piece . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes on very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needed 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and you can also change the individual instruments , the speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary form ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support you need to download and install a source of sources ( for example of k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; understood , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before , you will necessarily activate the adjustment of automation to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can click the arrow keys on the left from Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o , you can double to the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ working area a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file or I want to play a file only in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window window change and the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; draw .
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file , without adding them to a collection , turn off the setting automation to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection of added files . &quot;
&quot; let us assume , you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. assignment just want to play the first file . so , make the setting up to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d your temporary collection then contains exactly these a MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; then join , also B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid to play back and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ? &quot;
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you ! if I listen to these songs or the postcard see me that continues to program &amp; k@@ mid .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I have been studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m not a lot of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect MIDI files , play music and phr@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; have , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me a e @-@ mail : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org , or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge fre@@ ak if you send me a postcard from your home place or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , but if you want to contact a MIDI file , but you should have to contact me as I might have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time , written by no eman@@ cip@@ ation for money . I therefore want to make sure that I can only receive pro@@ gram@@ ing messages because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Bü@@ hler - Keep the error that the pitch of AW@@ E @-@ cards was too high .

&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which can look at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ iser .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ .@@ html / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality can depend on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM device or a AW@@ E card . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the parameters MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it is running if you don &apos;t have a sound card except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ players , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet than K@@ DE ; installed on this calcul@@ ator .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is formed by so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . and finally , there is an information panel that will only be displayed if you are re @-@ admit . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to select the preferred connections under the menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hier@@ arch@@ ie@@ stage . if you register an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and continuous play@@ list can also be changed through direct edit of XML configuration files . of course , you can only do it if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / k@@ m@@ player / , can also be updated through an editor , but also by using a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu must be selected with play@@ list and choose either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost , if the processing mode or any other group will be selected , without the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation at the starting and end can be de@@ activated by using ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list and change &#91; General Op@@ tions &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ ite option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can easily be inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / / / m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at the start doesn &apos;t need short , it will be automatically terminated by opening a different source . this would be interfer@@ ing at the end @-@ animation however , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G dur = / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f = / / / ; IM@@ G dur = / / / / ; IM@@ G dur = / / / / ; ; / / / / ; ; in the directory testing / some examples of S@@ MIL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
there is a rider to configuration of M@@ players in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; . here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size from the network and other things .
another tool to trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no rider for this playback dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list . here is an example of a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field Em@@ bed for YouTube in play@@ list XML .
&quot; to ensure that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can play in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as a service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog can be specified by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consoles application , and according to error messages regarding charging the browser module library . if no error occur , the back@@ end issue within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; for example , ph@@ on can be done with manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ list . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can be used by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the scanner can be used using the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configuration the V@@ DR ( Video data records ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ video port . there should ports be detected , of which a correct encoding must be found out ( for example , it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video , X@@ video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices is the only working ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension refers to the X server . therefore , the video server must therefore be used in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , they are used by KM@@ Player for the sources of different names . at the time of emergence of these documentation , this d@@ v@@ d@@ nav@@ source , d@@ v@@ d@@ source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ per@@ l , t@@ v@@ source , source source , v@@ cd@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the play@@ list . &quot;
is there hints as I can do my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not of the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is used as user root after adjust@@ ing the device . it is absolutely safe to set the / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; lat@@ ex ; : a professional correspondence application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; tex@@ live ; ( for older systems ) is used . &quot;
most of these components can be included in the use &amp; Linux ; distribution should be used for installation documentation or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; k@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the k@@ ile ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; k@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals are accepted into documentation . if the support for this project or documentation should be desired , the contact should be made via the k@@ ile ; -@@ website . &quot;
apply questions or if the comp@@ ile of &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list k@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ for use of all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphic interface and within this simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in an graphic interface and within such a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and its possibilities to learn the manual about Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start directly with reading the chapter of work with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the right choice : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . it is difficult to use , it can also be used to use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is that there is a less challenging character . &quot;
&quot; here is just a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to do it . by &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ r . &quot;
&quot; the same as other pron@@ unci@@ ation languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that will be specified as paper format , side effects and text box . the introduction is at least the command \ \ &apos; class , the kitchen starts with the command \ \ \ { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Fast @-@ entry assistant of &amp; k@@ ile ; is a comprehensive function for the fast creation of a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; the selection of the assist@@ ants ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some toll for the preparation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this is hereby described by the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , article &#91; letter &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , Article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pri@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; or custom . &quot;
encoding : hereby the character encoding is set . modern systems use the UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . the UTF @-@ 8 encoding should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only be loaded in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users are now not worried anymore . this is only a brief description of the functions and further information will be given in the section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - same as other source code editors - the identification of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; k@@ ile , there is a simple problem for sure that some mathematical environment will not be closed . however , it is due to you through the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you through the exact time and delivery . &quot;
&quot; when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ , { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and added a blank line to the command of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the menu ( e.g. \ \ &apos; command } ) . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into a few elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; encouraged the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the worst and sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ) :
&quot; with the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed through a mouse click on the respective basis . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful for creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; as soon as a DVI ; -@@ file &#91; framed file , jumps &amp; k@@ ile ; through one click on the respective line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file includes a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and other information such as the font and other information about the font art by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print out of DVI ; -@@ Files for various systems and barley . &quot;
&quot; when using the software search , the elements of DVI ; -@@ file with the editor can be cli@@ cked , the exact opposite section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is spec@@ ulated . once on a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is used . &quot;
&quot; Master document : this function is simplified using multiple files . using a master document , the work will be simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide Master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
quick structure : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code will be compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file downlo@@ ad@@ ress : in this mode the DVI ; -@@ file on the top @-@ out of the outside of the panel , and there is no appeal by &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after quick construction . &quot;
&quot; for viewing of the processing tool , the three large @-@ selection selection fields should be developed . the selection fields for the fast setup of the document was developed into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection box is for further applications such as tags , doors , notes , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
regarding : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selecting a selection box only ) .
&quot; when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . for example &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; k@@ ile ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection box with the name Gr@@ Ã Ã © e is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the Fu@@ Ã © notes etc . there are the following correspondence : &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; k@@ ile ; there are two selection options for setting up : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document , by selecting the document type and performance of the settings . 2 . the document can be written down with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the bra@@ ckets , according to the command \ \ &apos; class , contain the settings for the command . the font is determined not at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex must be compiled . the sim@@ pl@@ est way to this is the use of Men@@ Ã ¼ s bending or the button . &quot;
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ ile . &amp; ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; the comp@@ ile of the document fails , should be searched for errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started . if using fast @-@ construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the protocol should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; a environment ( English environment ) is a text that will be treated differently than the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font is supposed to have been created . the order \ \ partly { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } can be encouraged within the area of &quot; &quot; Ries@@ ig@@ â &quot; ( English . Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the reserves are only available within the environment ( of \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number of ) for the possibility within a environment .
&quot; for example , there are many ways to raise the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , grease pressure , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands are either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ \ { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ sive pressure and is as long as possible until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed with \ \ w@@ h { word } cur@@ sive .
\ \ Qu@@ ote : created a quote in document . the quote begins with \ \ \ { Qu@@ ote } and ends with \ \ \ { Qu@@ ote } .
&quot; after the background to the writing of the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation language , this follows a step @-@ for @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; k@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in wi@@ z@@ ard a little text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be completed . this should be min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and cran@@ ks@@ um and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor view or C@@ tr@@ l E can be turned back to the editor ( at the internal viewer ) , the window needs to be closed . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the DVI ; file has been created , the document may print or be converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and enjoy . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is a large file format file format ( English . D e V ice I n@@ ée ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers from the computer , there are many different types of the .d@@ vi issue such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ um@@ er@@ ler or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps like for the preparation of the document ( see ) . on the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document may be printed using file ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar encour@@ ages the conversion of DVI ; file in other formats . as soon as the DVI ; -@@ file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been created , converting to other formats using the P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the previous word encour@@ ages direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ ds . to this , only modern under settings can be saved ... tools . &quot;
&quot; in order to check out the presence , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in one line of the source code and close on request . the jump to the respective position in the DVI ; -@@ viewer takes place . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; k@@ ile ; described in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , you have to set up a text editor ( att@@ itudes for ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor ) &quot;
&quot; if using quick installation of the &amp; DVI ; -@@ viewer , it can &apos;t have a mistake . if a mistake , this is displayed in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol file creates the error source in the source code . in the editor , the button can be used to consider the error in the error . to consider the error message , the protocol must be cli@@ cked on the error , navigating immediately to the error message . &quot;
&quot; once you cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool bar , a window to choose from the document can be used for the document . the default settings are : &quot;
&quot; when choosing le@@ eres document , a document may be written either by reason or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created in &amp; k@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new model , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file has to be created or create a new file . &amp; k@@ ile ; can create a new presentation by selecting a existing document and selection of file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , some strings through other data will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or drawing code ) . these variables can be set up in settings and settings . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when creating your own presentation , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it will be used as follows : \ \ ping class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ SO@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to creating a presentation is the use of the assist@@ ants , and the use of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created , following steps are done : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , the own template can be extended instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from each &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files will be created , a simple way to create a presentation , should be searched after one in the internet and will be crossed under the steps below . &quot;
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers and her@@ ent of many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings for &amp; Kate ; they can be done directly from &amp; k@@ ile ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and his toll should learn the manual to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; do you want to start with reading the chapter of work with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ command re@@ ference , which can be called for the volume of La@@ Te@@ X reference . you can find a complete description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use their syntax , as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click on the C@@ tex button to balance the &amp; tex . this means that in this way , clicking the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par \ \ \ par \ \ \ par . &quot;
when pulling the text with dr@@ illed lin@@ ker mouse button the text is copied automatically in the cli@@ p@@ board .
&quot; when using the arrow keys , you can taste key parts of the source code in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the ability to browse the different types of source texts , and these are emphas@@ ized . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; a lot of assist@@ ants can be discussed . this is also an own type of book@@ marks within the text . however , this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that they will automatically determine the jump stamp at the first input of a character . &quot;
the editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; even though &amp; Kate ; already outstanding functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; important functions for the writing of a &amp; lat@@ ex ; special commands for their selection . under editing the following commands are contained to the text selection :
&quot; a complete paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides have an empty line ) . this extended significance does not include tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only down@@ ward thing is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; the word under the current cur@@ sor position out of the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command also has a enlarged star ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for example , a part of the document can be removed , and by pressing the button can be removed . &amp; Kate ; offers the key ¼ r@@ amp C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the following commands to apply to the text of the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; k@@ ile ; is included in the description of editing paragraph .
it was already clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders inferior to work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; for example .
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly before the order to the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the order to close the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or within the command \ \ , { surroundings } , will be at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of snow@@ sho@@ cked environment commands , this command can &apos;t be lost , so that the latest environment is not dist@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under the work Te@@ X @-@ group are some important commands , which meet from the working environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly before the welded cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; with this command , at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the welded cl@@ amp . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the welded cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , will be at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering a lot of emb@@ ell@@ ished groups bra@@ ckets can be lost quickly , the latest group , so that the remaining structure of the &amp; tex ; groups are not dist@@ orted . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; they are used for the purpose of the purpose of the purpose . for the purpose of purpose , the sign is used in &amp; k@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple beginnings is used . &amp; k@@ ile ; knows this case and provides two close @-@ to @-@ use mark for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic setting can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X as well as settings .
there are also other specific settings ( e.g. n@@ ore or French ) and thus German or French . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when the shift of Shift ; inputs for Shift ; input signals &amp; k@@ ile ; if the current position is located within a list of lists ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , but not only one line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
within a tables setting close &amp; k@@ ile ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with a close line breaks off .
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ puri@@ fied &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . you can be added to La@@ Te@@ X .
&quot; some users were able to arrange the columns in tables and arrange all the E@@ t @-@ characters ( amp ; ) one another . if this Tab@@ ulator is not able to do it , for a few intermediate area for the column position of the current table . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; Kate , already a good source code has already been built , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) it is still extended . all these modes are available for automatic dist@@ ortion . all these modes are available for automatic dist@@ ortion . all these modes are possible for automatic dist@@ ortion . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by the command \ \ partly { surroundings } will be &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically add the order \ \ end { surroundings } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; the last letter of the input is removed , the last letter of the input is removed , and the list of the list is caused by entering a further letter too . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , some jump to these positions is possible , and jumping parameters can be found . &quot;
&quot; under settings of k@@ ile ; set up ... k@@ ile ; verification settings for these lists can be made . there are different types of boxes for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as remote control of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is used for adjust@@ ing environments . there are always a few letters to be entered for a result . on the other hand , environments become so often used , that &amp; k@@ ile ; a special mode for adjust@@ ing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling for the finish mode , the order will be automatically inserted in the area or the key ¼ r@@ zel ( Alt + Shift ) . after that , the environment will be continued on the easiest way and it will be rest@@ art@@ ed by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; after this is completed , the environment will be closed again . once &amp; k@@ ile ; recognize that it is a list of lists , even a first \ \ item command is used . &quot;
&quot; under att@@ itudes , set up ... k@@ ile ; verification settings to these lists are made . this mode uses the list of list of reference mode for &amp; tex ; - and lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; support custom lists of ab@@ dic@@ tive lists , which will be replaced immediately by changing strings , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word adjustment mode is set up , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large numbers are not helpful for the automatic dist@@ ortion . however , it has been determined that many of them are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; k@@ ile ; the ful@@ fill@@ ment for all of them already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the men@@ ue settings ... K@@ ile verification ons . here , the swelling value for display should be specified . &quot;
the full@@ ness files in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / .
&quot; the dialogue graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . for example , the basics of the basics in the graphic formats should be considered sections and data . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for the guidance and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is used , then the pages are arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted to a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to make the result of the work , you need to comp@@ ile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ing in the menu of creating comp@@ iling , creating and creating a creation . &quot;
&quot; for the comp@@ iling of the source code as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used by Alt ; 3 , with Alt ; 4 the DVI ; -@@ file in a PS file can be converted into a PS file and can be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command @-@ fast delivery , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ ile . should not be used when a new window will be used every time . &quot;
a new project will be a new project for the new project .... Hier@@ in the following information about the project are asked :
&quot; when using the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path of the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file must be specified . &quot;
the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the uti@@ lization of EC@@ MAS@@ TER -@@ Ko@@ de . scripts can be administered in the vertical glue .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; k@@ ile ; even more .
the first must be said that the scripts of scripts in &amp; k@@ ile ; a systematic object ( = k@@ ile ) has the following methods :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite out system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; k@@ ile ; provides a lot of different assistance to the users . &quot;
&quot; &amp; tex@@ ex ; and tex@@ ex ; and tex@@ tual ; are delivered with many documents , including a documentation for the packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference . &quot;
&quot; it is not only for a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather , it is ideal for a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; k@@ ile ; divided into three major book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; du@@ ex ; / Tex@@ ts , the Fin@@ den of the right document is not always easy . as an excellent help , the small use of tex@@ as , which contains a database with all to &amp; k@@ ile ; delivered documents and this for a graphical top area . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the gr@@ assy advantage is the search for package names or whi@@ ch@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .

&quot; &amp; c@@ sig is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails , with the command @-@ interface , you produce random signatures or daily signals from a list . this command line interface delivers signals for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature from the Sign@@ ature File is read and read . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signals , the same signature is the same signature from the Sign@@ ature File of &amp; k@@ sig ; read more Sign@@ atures , such as the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails each day . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N file New . this allows you to have entered into a new signature ; in the bottom section Sign@@ ature Con@@ qi : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org If you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ tr@@ l ; S file saving or click on the flo@@ ppy bol . &quot;
&quot; you can create many signatures . then , you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you &apos;re using e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always sufficient signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then in the menu file , or click the symbol with the red cross in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog short command . here you can choose short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . Click the right below on the button and enter the new shor@@ tw@@ ave by pressing the button or button . &quot;
&quot; for use of &amp; k@@ sig ; it is necessary &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.5 required . in order to im@@ pose Sign@@ atures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signal text from the output of a command . &quot;
&quot; all listing elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below . &quot;

&quot; the version 3.2 of &amp; quantitative lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in its integration in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all these tools use comp@@ ress as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a sub@@ position . the combination makes fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who worked with the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has to have worked , and it is still a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal need ; simply use the symbol for the XML @-@ processor and ready ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be an inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the secret work folder , then leave the current job folder . if not , remove them to the current work@@ folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; -@@ files are deleted every time if supposed pro@@ c is started .
&quot; as I said , everyone who has worked on &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; there is now a great graphic surface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book , they simply leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to a issue on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported mistakes and try again . &quot;
&quot; the file is already selected in &amp; quantitative file . if not , it simply leave the current file . if not , delete the file the skins and select the file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the well @-@ represented file is well , they click the well @-@ shaped check selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ TD ; which is specified in the &amp; XML file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Ex@@ ternal ) ; and XML ; diagram as well as for the Rel@@ ax@@ NG verification is the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection is required . &quot;
yes , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
&quot; should it be selected to be processed in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , they simply leave the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file file using the other file File selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the file name , as the result is named , the file is usually stored in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; be la@@ wed , have possibly little to do . you may benefit from the additional functionality now and do not have to wait until somebody is used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start @-@ up with the menu plug@@ ins . so the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialogue enables to manage all the plug@@ ins to manage and add new options . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ ELE@@ MENT :
here you can enter the search engine . in addition to plug @-@ ins without a memory location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people work in a kind of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the indication of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features -@@ dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of user and serves to clear identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , like both team manager and Sub@@ project manager . &quot;
&quot; the user can look for yourself from the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who it is . this happens by looking out the team member out of the list and the button S@@ etze as expresses . the currently selected member ( its identification ) appears in bold after which you are : text . &quot;
nick@@ name and setting of their own identity are important regarding news and notes . see further information about remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of your team , there is another advantage of the members of the team : it can be created an event to the team manager if something particular happens . see further information in further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are carried out if something specific in the project is done . an example would be able to record the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so that later someone would be secured , or a script that will be added to the CV@@ S file , as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
&quot; an email will be sent to the list of selected address data . the address may be a team or sub@@ project manager . see , we@@ i can be set up such ladder . &quot;
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
note that notes is simple . it can be selected by the editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area followed by default text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a decisive member of the team . in this case , the syntax of @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) , the nick@@ name of the team head of the project manager , should be led by the project manager and Sub@@ project leaders , as shown in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the bra@@ ckets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ att@@ ing languages which is supported by D@@ TD @-@ ag@@ no@@ stic and web@@ based form@@ att@@ ing and script languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be accessed by Settings Quant@@ a . this dialog covers some pages that are treated with each other .
the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tags including car complet@@ es can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ism of Tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ ism of automatically noti@@ fied tags : normal Groß / small sp@@ elling means , the tags are inserted so as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / Small attributes of attributes : large / small dimensions automatically added attributes . normal Groß / small dimensions means , the attributes are inserted so as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags : if fixed , is optional for tags , for which the exclusive day is optional , that immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : as above all other tags , except for all other tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end @-@ day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent : controls the automatic convert of acute characters into the corresponding encoding during the ti@@ pping .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . by using the standard , the default settings can be restored . &quot;
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or in other way as with file open @-@ open files ( where the coding of the file can be passed ) . this attitude will be stretched out by the same in the project characteristics if a project is charged .
&quot; standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD was not recognized . this attitude will be cast out by the same in the project characteristics , if a project is charged . &quot;
&quot; create a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates a regular backup copy , allowing for a power loss or crash . this is not the same as storing the file . this is not the same as saving the file . even if not stored documents will be a backup regularly , according to the set time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editor or its own view ( or the documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) , what makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
put the window settings on the standard back next start is useful if the user interface has come through to change the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ era command line parameters .
the warning message range serves the tax of possibility to activate ad war@@ nings by an@@ ha@@ ken by no more questions .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code in shared mode . in regard to the different modes see . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and structural tree , which represents the picture of the par@@ ser node in the document , in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the winding action by clicking on the structure of the structure . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural tree settings the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the actu@@ alization of construction in the tree , and how deep in a change of structural tree are opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are found , where there are no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to fixed abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) , which are un@@ folded for the most extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it can be valid for several &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s , it can be a valid group for PHP , which means a valid group for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins can be managed by the third side of the third side , which can be re@@ used by each K@@ part @-@ enabled application , at most well @-@ known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . in the insert of a plug @-@ in , the following plug must be noted : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to the Plu@@ gin , if it is not in a stand as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will open the plug @-@ in at the start , so it can open the current file to the corresponding file ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
component of the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plug@@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ boxes refuse to load the store if this option is not chosen .
&quot; check the Plu@@ gin : is this enabled , then test@@ et &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the specified information is correct . if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the non @-@ necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was discontinued , as well as the support for d@@ b@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in concept was implemented , which enables various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plug @-@ in is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; added . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with selecting a matching de@@ bu@@ gger plug in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in selection field can be changed specific settings .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of supervised variables is displayed . usually in the left Do@@ ck appears .
&quot; a view , in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed below . usually appears in the lower do@@ ck . &quot;
a view that is shown in the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the lower do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bug@@ gers , everything or some of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , manufactured , or they share the plug@@ in with , on Deb@@ u@@ rous demands . this action is used by default if a project is opened , so that it must not be respected . &quot;
&quot; the counterpart to de@@ bug@@ ging session Start the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , or finish the leaves according to requirements . &quot;
send an HTTP request to the server to introduce a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; does the de@@ bu@@ gger start to start with the execution of the script and information about the supervised variables as well as the currently run on line . if this happens , the execution will be continued , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; does the de@@ bu@@ gger start to start with the execution of the script , without information about supervised variables and the current row number . if this happens when a script is given , the execution begins , as soon as a request is provided . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , without going into the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby if possible in functions and include . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to go over and go to the next so , as if there were not . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue , in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the overs@@ aw value appears in the Vari@@ o view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialogue , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how you can help &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type Ed@@ iting packages ( D@@ T@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; used to provide support for marking and scripts ; skills such as car complet@@ es and flexibility ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; S &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the brand @-@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or CSS ; and D@@ T@@ EP ; s consist of two parts , the day folder and the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; s can be selected , downloaded or automatically created from an existing D@@ TD . see in for details about converting . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create the XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; D@@ T@@ EP . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ r@@ c . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; even . tool bar permit a quick insert of tags in a document without any danger of a type@@ writer . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing as a folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder carry the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML , whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advis@@ able to use as many as possible , so many users have a better insight and more information at work with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes any element in detail , all about the possibilities and limits becomes simple in a simple way . &quot;
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML @-@ document . it can only occur in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains only one element type about itself , otherwise nothing . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day class . the name of the basic class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the Type Method . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of tags . this element can only appear once for any attribute . it sets the name and type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
gives the bott@@ ling used source code for the attributes in the tag Edit@@ or@@ dialog and in the attribute @-@ tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of a interface . d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method@@ ology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag the elements of a list is group@@ ed together . it can only occur for a attribute description . it is a single element type element .
lays down the position of a tags within a dialogue . this day can only occur in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; Tag ) . the element is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that can occur within the specified tags . this element is a single @-@ element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single @-@ element type .
all day XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; Declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ased and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaced , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tools dialog in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and check the Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
&quot; this function is not available yet . currently , verification only takes only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; sch@@ ema &gt; ELE@@ MENT out of the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file should be schem@@ atically . &quot;
&quot; in the following an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file should be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ?

&quot; the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , file is as well as simple and there is a editor that can be edited via D@@ TD settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = User de 1 for &amp; quantitative ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD specification . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) nick@@ name . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name . &quot;
a action can set up action with settings ... click on New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; this promotion is assigned to a key@@ chains . with clicking the User User Station , a key@@ chains can be assigned , with K@@ one is the current key@@ chains . &quot;
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the determin@@ ated settings and inserted in execution of the promotion , this text is inserted into the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to use the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the fast start @-@ dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ you variable in command line : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we replaced the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file is removed from the document name . &quot;
% pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ um lus ; only one instance is running when D@@ COP is used to control the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used .
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the listed methods , a script input from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus can be accepted by default . in the selection box , input can be determined , which is to send to the default setting . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the entry , the output of the executed application can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal output written on the default edition ; error messages , to the default text written text may be specified by the value of the selection box is set out : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the brand @-@ up language , it is recommended to provide tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group create an own tool bar . in given case , it is not too many , so you can create a tool bar with the name of the brand . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you have to add actions and configure . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of the window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom end of the window starts working mode .
fill all the necessary fields and add the day to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes , and use their use , activate dialogue &quot; tag , &quot; if available , therefore a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this icon ? we replace it before we have difficulties . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the promotion is better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; choose from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose the size other . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a button on a symbol . by using green ( green is usually regarded as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should be interpreted at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled ; -@@ Day in the current document will be submitted . &quot;
&quot; according to the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this is happening via the menu with settings ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button button and put it on the button , and put it with other tags , so there are , or confirm with OK . &quot;
suppose you want to add some usual &amp; quant@@ it@@ lus ; functions for tool@@ bar add or it should be set to set the tool@@ bar in several groups . open the tool@@ bar via settings of the tool@@ bar . make sure that the desired tool bar is selected .
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element , add the arrow keys to the right . this adds the element to the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , how the Tren@@ to support group@@ ing . someone who could not know my tool bar could believe that the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ kno@@ b the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested due to all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; back in the right folder . after Neu@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool bar should be loaded ( s ) if your tool bar is opened ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user , the possibility to add documentation for the script language or the form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to like . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; document management for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory , if someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ ati@@ fication / script / etc ; -@@ language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . then we have to leave the do@@ cr@@ c file here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = pf@@ ad , relative to this file , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ 2.3 , # Sec@@ tions , # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ tions , # Sec@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 2 = func@@ 2.@@ html @-@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html @-@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c thee = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level of the top element = PHP 4.2 , PHP 4.2 , = table of Cont@@ ents , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html G@@ etting Start@@ ed = Introduction , ... Introduction = Inter@@ age@@ .@@ html @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known borders for the chess player ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the table of contents directly to a file is refer@@ enced ( and consistent , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) . &quot;
space characters influence nothing but watch out &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; Res@@ our@@ c@@ end@@ at@@ ots are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file , which is to be displayed in the context of the context of context and pressing of C@@ tr@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array . there are only two types of entries here : the context @-@ list ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and the file association lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
now you can easily store your file do@@ cr@@ c and get to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / Web@@ a / doc / Web@@ a / doc / Web@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Web@@ a / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps and copy your HTML documentation .
&quot; if you are sure that these good and it is worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as documentation have been used to the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; they will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ um lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ ating resources ( D@@ T@@ EP packages , tool bar with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or else to whom will be sent . in different places there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ T@@ EP ) with email , tool bar tool with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archives , where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be reviewed and used only if our team is working as correct and usable for publication . in order to provide a full contribution , it is ensured for our team as well as for later users . &quot;
&quot; if you upload your Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the case you have several keys , you can choose a button ( URL preview can stay empty ) and with clicking OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; upload from the menus D@@ TD D@@ TD ( D@@ T@@ EP ) , upload tool@@ bars , and files in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , exam@@ ines &amp; quant@@ um ; the authenti@@ city of resource caused by testing the integrity and the Sig@@ nific@@ ence . in the case of problems , it and it can be broken . if the integrity is given and the resource will be correct , a message appears with the statement of the origin@@ ality of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work with XML languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be used to work by using a D@@ T@@ EP package . it &apos;s the easier way to convert a D@@ TD automatically to a D@@ T@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started by the D@@ TD store and Conver@@ ting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description , which should be used . afterwards the following dialog appears : &quot;
objective name : the newly created &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string , which should appear in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN htt@@ p : &quot;
&quot; after converting the D@@ T@@ EP according to the conversion : if enabled , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after converting the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor that can be adapted to the new &amp; D@@ T@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; there are some key concepts . in order to understand this and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this chapter tries to bring them familiar with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding and quant@@ um lus ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ um lus ; the working range is divided into three areas : global , locally and projects . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are used for each , the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , all of which is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; stored in the common folder structure of &amp; quantitative materials , which will be available to each in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web development agent for a single user . these are custom patterns and tool bars . local elements are stored in user folder , so they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns up to tool bar with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simple , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder of the project , which provides common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the quant@@ um lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of a few main areas : the editor window , the builders , the cart@@ els with info and the tool@@ bars . please propose in , and for further information about these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document of matching entries , such as close to the current , other or all cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites , re@@ load , delete or upload of the document , jump to a book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands for current document . &quot;
&quot; the editor will lead to another context menu on the editor , such as basic processing steps ( cutting / copy / insert ) , editing the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or open to the file , if the string is named under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor , the tool@@ bars of the editor will be shown . at present &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional as standard , for which a set of tool bar will be shown . in the course of further expansion of tool@@ bars , the tool@@ bars will be adapted to the new features and thus related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , for example &amp; lt ; then click the symbol that represents the day , then you can insert the data for this just one day ( such as anchor ) , add several attributes ( such as anchor ) , add several attributes ( such as anchor ) , add several attributes ( such as anchor ) . &quot;
&quot; the building perspectives ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate in the information about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and pier@@ ce . in the representation of cart@@ ei@@ re@@ it@@ ers are available for files , project , mu@@ ster@@ fications , documentation structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of buildings . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; quantitative tool ; it shows all files in the project and allows to manage the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , upload or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out using the context menu . &quot;
&quot; a further possibility of &amp; quant@@ um lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a presentation : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on which they are used . the category depends on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; working range . global templates are always available , local templates are only usable for the respective user and templates . more to templates are available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available script languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can download the available information on a script . more functions are available , such as the script will start , edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . through the right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and recovery of the tree is opened . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears under the other buildings . with it can change some attributes and nam@@ es@@ rooms , which allows the content of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the full documentation to find web technology for your development . you can download the documentation documentation for &amp; quantitative documents ; of the quant@@ um lus ; &apos; documentation of documentation can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited and viewed as a project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two boxes of ant@@ ei@@ re@@ ites at the bottom end of the window , using the usable information can be achieved : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows information about each in Quant@@ a running script . for example , the D@@ TD used the current document and all changes to D@@ TD are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this Kart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter shows all mistakes in the market up of the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( such as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the appropriate command . the chocolate display of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus .
a further function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with an e @-@ mail ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar @-@ Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; and if they receive a tool bar in an email ; how any other secure and load !
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; files on your system can adapt . to get a number of options that can be handed over to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin folder , you should make sure that is no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in P@@ AT@@ H in front of her bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a wide range of powerful functions .
&quot; while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a nutriti@@ ous idea ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ um lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . I can define it in &amp; XML ; then it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it should be suitable &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ um lus ; as product is based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; it is not only possible that someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ report is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quantitative users , as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web development uses the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by using the program , you can note &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . ( more about them will find them in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; quantitative ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development , and quickly developed to a sophisticated tool with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; quantitative ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; quantitative ; associated developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in the details of the documentation is with help : / quant@@ a ( either this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / quant@@ a ) . &quot;
&amp; quantitative ; is currently developed and cared for by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon sequences @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list is changed every time if you can open a file , which is not located , the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . see in the section via templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project lecture file , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; converted to insert out of the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters used for &amp; HTML , so that it will display correctly and not be understood from the browser as form@@ att@@ ing instruction . &quot;
&quot; convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; code , which is the correct way to insert a special character and spaces in &amp; URL ; it is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor @-@ day . &quot;
switches off the block@@ ers or off . it allows you to select text blocks with the help of the &amp; Shift key .
go straight to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages !
looking for a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or used with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the news window or not on . this is the window , in which you can see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
- and registration of the problem rep@@ orters at the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main hub . the problem is activated once you are changing to the structural tree .
&quot; displays the symbolic turn left from the main window . this column allows you to sit with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will be recorded together with entries prior or next , depending on the position of the cur@@ sors in the document . &quot;
Bookmark with other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ames of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; quantitative lus ; -@@ projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . selected files are then copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . this enables , e.g. graphic files into your project folders or a sub@@ folder , and then add to the project . &quot;
downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you will find details of details . &quot;
invites a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool bar . this creates only the names . actions must be saved by att@@ itudes , or you will be asked to store the tool@@ bars of tool@@ bars , if you want to store the tool bar . &quot;
&quot; a tool@@ bar from the visible range . this does not delete it from the hard disk . if you don &apos;t delete the tool@@ bar yet , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; thus , you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; team , thus present the tool bar in the next publication ) . the menu option opens a new E@@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars on the main server where any other can access it . see in .
download a &amp; D@@ TD ; that you or anything else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own certificate format .
charging / auff@@ eur of the Ent@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it is useful if the Ent@@ ities from the &amp; D@@ T@@ EP is to renew . if this global is not present and a write permission in the global K@@ DE file is not present , the shop fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently loaded tool bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is available , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day evaluation dialog , if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the smart inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this means only with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . smar@@ ter inser@@ tion means that &amp; quantitative inser@@ tion is ref@@ using , if this day speaks to this place the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the top menu points . Click here to click on a activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the syn@@ dic@@ ation mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ding schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop , select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application Ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . by some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can sometimes need time or cause un@@ beautiful graphics . the card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; additionally , this menu includes an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a contract the appropriate sub@@ window is activated . &quot;
&quot; for the display of the status bar on the bottom edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , Haupt@@ f@@ enst@@ ers or respectively . &quot;
&quot; changes in this dialog can use any application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ brows@@ ers . &quot;
directed the behaviour of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; Kate . you will find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool bar or which you can change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help with the environment of the maus@@ oleum , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; quant@@ um lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available , but as in every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; development in financial form , they find the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled up at the top of the project named the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can find the server address of the machine on which you want to access , except you edited local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol is used . depending on the setup of the remote computer could be necessary to adapt . &quot;
&quot; this is the file , where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder that are stored in the tool@@ bar for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of standards . &quot;
this allows files to include files from the local file system into the project . several files or whole folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great , when you have a static web content you can download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) must be different . &quot;
&quot; if a project will be built somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project will be re@@ bound up in the main folder of the project . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good th@@ inner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ ken , or by removing the skins , cl@@ amps from the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that can simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can instantly upload with the project Properties in the menu profile or with the key@@ chains Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assist@@ ants and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder possible ) that should be re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project ord@@ ner .
&quot; supplem@@ entary option to top , even files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded with the opening of the project , can be read more about projec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently , G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug@@ in can be set with the button options . in case the trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the lower window profiles , upload profile ( see in ) can be adjusted as well as the display of a tree view to the content of the server for each profile , giving a separate construction view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted , as well as a mailing list . see in details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration you can turn off event actions and add these actions , change or delete . event actions are carried out if a previously specified event occurs , such as the sick@@ le of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; quantitative lus ; the last project , which was open . this behaviour can not be found at present . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , open the project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ um lus is closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to store changes before leaving , if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you invite a new project . &quot;
&quot; the project experience provides free access to the files in the project . here , the files can be managed in current project . &quot;
&quot; file behave as well , however , the entries are open and open ... in with the right mouse button @-@ listed context menu : &quot;
&quot; here , different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information on the location of the uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button will be low to prevent removing removing . &quot;
&quot; the password will keep the password in the core memory . this possibility is useful if it is necessary to upload files , and save the rather un@@ safe password on the record option . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before the up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog will appear : &quot;
this is the server name to be copied onto the files . either a full qualified domain name or IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and the installed K@@ IO slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this must not be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your Ang@@ ular shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . the password is stored on the plate , so that it cannot be read on the plate , but everyone with programming languages can be easily seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. through simple divers of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu or the project tool , accessible via settings of the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own work mode .
&quot; as already mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best can be handled by tool@@ bar . use and adding differ . adding tool bars below is treated below the tool@@ bar section . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , which can be set up with new action , can be set up other actions such as tool@@ bar , tool@@ bar or tool bar , which can be specified in the dialog where actions can be visible on this or other tool bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to a action ( symbol ) on a tool bar , the entries will be shown in addition to the entries and action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the promotions on them can set up the menu with tool@@ bars ... and set settings actions .. be adjusted .
&quot; templates are essentially linked in the essential documentation , code @-@ escal@@ opes and files to link . you can copy , move or any of the system existing directory with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or any of the system existing directory into the storage room . you can copy , move or any of the system existing directory into the storage room . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions on the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; bin@@ aries is all that is not pur@@ er text . it can be inserted any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , flash files &amp; etc ; bin@@ aries are usually found in the storage room under global templates . further information on templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be made from any text document type . based on this templates are new documents can be created . normally a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a proper way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see in more information about templates .
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document , based on a template but the same text range will always be inserted into the documents . you can find everything about a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . see more information about templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates for all websites are mentioned as templates . they are a collection of different documents which can be organized in a folder structure , available in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; design a document structure of popularity ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select file as template as template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , notice that ( even if it was stored as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under project projects . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document , and click file as a presentation selection as local / project management system . alternatively , the choice can easily be moved with pulling and lay down on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy only in a pre @-@ file folder . it can be used to use all file management functions , such as pulling and insert or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
you can click on a file tree or in the project files . select a name for template and backup . by default it is stored in the project folder but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
&quot; project results enable a very oriented approach . you can add headphones and foot@@ er lines or create dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or linked with them . in addition , some things can be associated with templates in projects very profound in mind . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ window structure in the sub@@ window frames are based on the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / quant@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ a / Tem@@ plates . &quot;
&quot; to determine the behavior of an folder in advance , click on the folder with the right mouse button to select and select the context menu features . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is low as soon as the attributes of the attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except for the regular file in advance . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , unless they would be explicitly enabled . in case of ordinary folder , the bl@@ ah would appear with something like text blocks . if nothing appears , you probably find in a regular folder . &quot;
allows previous or subsequent text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows you to out@@ fit all content into a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ er .
&quot; in addition , the context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ um lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that can be reached via the menu Editor via the V@@ PL ; editor and second shares the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; Editor works as follows : it invites a document such as normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit , and if necessary , you can edit , and if necessary , you can edit the modifications in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that includes &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit these code editor . in order to edit &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit these code editor . there are no plans to change these behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is syn@@ ch@@ ron . with pressures of F@@ 9 , this mode is already activated , this mode is already activated for the active cur@@ sor from a window to others , whereby the position is retained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings of Quant@@ um .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can automatically choose between synchron@@ ization after a click , or automatically select the time period . generally , the recommendation is set : a small chip@@ board for fast hosts and a large chip@@ board for slow PC . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so it is possible to select the documentation of invisible tags in the work with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor is designed to change the following document : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags distur@@ bed the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. impact words for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click into the list allows the change of In@@ hal@@ tes , e.g. key words on the column names and key@@ word key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new path of creation from pages in browser . you can add CSS rules with the list below or delete a change about the list is exactly as in met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to insert an external CSS @-@ style template by clicking on the file button and select the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of cur@@ sors is like in a text processing , due to the arrows , possible . among rare circumstances the cur@@ sor stand as usual . text can be inserted as usual . text can be inserted by insert and be deleted by return or distances . &quot;
&quot; the inser@@ tion of tags is made in the same way beyond the tool@@ bars , as in the source code editor , that the inser@@ tion of tags are not removed before existing tags , e.g. an anchor @-@ day , surrounded by text , each other should be removed with text . &quot;
some tool bar like the tables assistant or the list@@ ings are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to use the tables or lists of tool@@ bars in this release .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of breast@@ feeding . in contrast to other programs for breast@@ feeding things the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the breast@@ feeding can be persecuted .

template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template which consists of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 up to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the system of the user . on Uni@@ x@@ - or Cy@@ g@@ win systems the name is allowed to have a pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for personal file . on RIS@@ C OS systems also allows further environmental variables .
Path : a path to change the desktop . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; will be replaced by the path to your personal file .
data : the XML @-@ data or XML _ document that will be edited from the style . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ gt ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ;
&quot; running time command : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ Qu@@ it } , step , step@@ Up , step@@ down , next , continue , run , press option , options &quot;
there are many graphical tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me tell me why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated because one of the contributions had been carried out many changes , and at the same time , another programm@@ ers had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in combination . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly was changed inside this lines . and there was no references to the places where perhaps the result of this changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; so , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could be differences in line and changes to white signs . later , any amount of further useful features have been added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare the text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the same and mer@@ ging of folders . this function related &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a complete file browser .
&quot; also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently from each other on a piece of co@@ de and changes the correct result . in this editor , you can even edit the result . in this editor you can even edit the result . the screen photo shows three Qu@@ ell files at the merge : &quot;
&amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; helps you all the same and merge folder . this screenshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&quot; &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and be@@ ating the possibilities of current color monitors . if you often have to check Ko@@ de , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no anger more , if no one changes the collapse . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other diff@@ ers in one line , then the color shows that the file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can ease the ti@@ p@@ work by simply complete the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folder k@@ diff@@ 3 folder folders with diff@@ 3 folder folders ( folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder folder ) folder
&quot; opening dialog allows manual to type fil@@ en@@ ames of fil@@ en@@ ames , select a selection of file browser ( file ... ) or select a last open file from the list . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file . if you have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; if you choose file folder , you can also select a folder . if you select a file , the compar@@ is@@ or and mer@@ ging of folders is selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in both other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merge is crossed , the input field is active and can edit it . however , it is not necessarily required to get a output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ button opens a dialog with settings . here you can define options before you start with the compar@@ ing / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text compare . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t need to select files , you can easily connect the dialog with the break button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use pulling and use : simply pull a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes it contains a file such as several similar functions . if you want to figure out how similar to these functions , it would like to create a relatively large effort . you would need to download and compare these relevant sections , then insert and compare these relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can pull out nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the lyrics of text in a comparison window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpre@@ t the drawing and put text into another program as cutting and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case , your original data could perish . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text box , the info line of the source window is the character A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional ) , let the mouse rest for a while on the line . then a small relief window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three sources , the letters A , B and C are assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pre@@ ferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if any difference is detected , one sees in the color , which file distingu@@ ishes itself . if both files are distinguished , the default color is red for it . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . this is important in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) . &quot;
&quot; right next to the text is the summary column . if differences were found , the column shows the appropriate color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in character strings and in a few , rare individual cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column from the text , where the respective source file has no lines . when the respective source file is activated , the line on broken rows are represented . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; ... &#93; if you have the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved is the saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jumps to the subsequent dissolved / un@@ conscious conflict around the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict that has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window , the group is shown in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed in the windows , where the current group is highlighted in the windows , where the current group is highlighted in the color . it will appear with the color background colour for the actual range and on the left hand is a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic merge or by manual editing , no further line will remain in the group ; then it is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your opinion , and perhaps again add another source . this text is not available in the final stored file , nor in a mark you may copy and paste different . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; connection flows ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the results window . go carefully with this feature . &quot;
&quot; note : when choosing the sources , ignore the options , or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; this navig@@ ates is mainly using the image of the image and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are used in one of the window , you can also use the arrows at the beginning , right , late , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to use . with insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ load mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows at the beginning of the respective group ( as already stated in paragraph and the ed@@ itable output window ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ Picture / C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l image down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict as a conflict . therefore , the conflict must be distinguished between dissolved and un@@ resolved conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking to the cli@@ p@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the copy -@@ button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ insert ) . if this is enabled , you will be automatically copied and manual copying files . be careful if you could notice the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; line @-@ moun@@ ts are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX versions are not using a line @-@ in @-@ line sign \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems are not using the tick control system \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the tick control of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and list of the last used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu entry in@@ gen@@ - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; choose a writing with fixed width . ( on some systems , dialogue also provides a variable width of variable width , but you should not use this . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ic script . if the chosen writing is not supported , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; in systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be displayed . in these systems the button settings automatically sets an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the tab@@ ulator key has inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press input or return , the return line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , any selection will be copied automatically into the cli@@ p@@ board . manual copy in the cli@@ p@@ board is cancelled . &quot;
you can select which tick @-@ type type you prefer to store . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; while compar@@ ing files tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first step , all complete identical lines in the source files can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es white signs . the second step compar@@ es white signs . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . white signs will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car return &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , other again save only one line @-@ to @-@ side comparison , although they might be different . if this option is activated , however , files might be disabled . during operation , this option must be disabled . in the default setting this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the outcome , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white signs . &quot;
&quot; intensive after even smaller differences . the option is enabled in the default setting . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly at very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the automatic transm@@ itting mode , this setting will be displayed as long as the result of the selection is displayed before the closest conflict will continue . &quot;
automatically solves automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if the automatic selection is also used in numbers or comments when the options are ignored in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ Comments .
these options are treated in chapter on scanning and run a mer@@ ging . watch for details under documentation for directory comparison and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists a older version , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original file . if already a backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , this will be deleted without additional backup . &quot;
fits the language of the user interface . modify this option does not affect the current program . you have to end and restart the change . ( this option is not available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted globally about the control centre . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you are activated , this option will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; regarding the selection fields for coding , a short note that is the local coding . ( this cannot be changed here and has purely inform@@ al character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted , as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can define what encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing device , they may not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might handle 16 @-@ bit ASCII , but the processing command can only handle only 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) with this option you can set the code of the processing of pre@@ fabri@@ cation . &quot;
&quot; turn off , turn down the modification of changes in white signs in text or reviews . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or Ign@@ ori@@ ere C / C + + -@@ Comments &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences in a colour coded overclo@@ cking column is displayed . but sometimes , you may only want to see the differences between two of three files . according to selection of A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second overclo@@ cking column with the necessary information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available place on the screen rather for long lines . simply use the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
the compar@@ ative window to each other or another . this can also be useful for advertis@@ ements of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to bring the files together . the current file will start together . a simple click starts the merge and use the file name for output file . ( if this function is used to start the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , they will first pass them to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own default processor , which means that you can use this function for example . you can use this function for example . you can use this function for example . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass the command to this external command ( see above ) , then the command of the command is the same command . you can only write your own pre@@ processor which is exactly equal to your request . each input line has to have a corresponding edition line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when ordering the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users want not to program it . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases , or per@@ l are completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command to convert the input in capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;@@ s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &apos; s in the text string refers to the found text in the first cl@@ ung . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in capital letters .
CV@@ S and other ver@@ sion@@ control systems use some key words to add automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . the \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ Prin@@ ciple \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with us , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for a further pre @-@ processing command for line treatment . &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hits , and each showing is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , you may want to perform several activities at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the rules of each other . example : &quot;
&quot; instead , you can also use anything else such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; aller@@ gies are different in per@@ l some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and merge . the further operations only change the data that the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus is seen .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ in @-@ pre@@ processor will see the output of normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or differences , you can acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programm@@ ers have to process many files . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively and perform together . &quot;
... making a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot;
&quot; can the merge sim@@ ulate and shows the sim@@ ulated changes , without it really perform , &quot;
&quot; execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ ing and merge of individual files . you only need to open file on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder was given , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , do not run the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder , you will inform you a little news window about current progress . if you break the scan of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
any file and any folder that was found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or on the object double or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions of all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you click on a file , the file is started , and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such cases , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , the colors are red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C . &quot;
&quot; with identical record , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered identical if their whole content is identical . then , folders the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant to its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C identical , but not B : copy from B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same data type ( e.g. if a file and B one file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B one file is ) : error : contra@@ dict@@ ory data types . as long as such faul@@ ts objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode for synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target folders , and if the option are synchron@@ ize directories . then you choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical so that after one entry ... &quot;
&quot; a and B exist , but not identical : merge and the result in both folders ( the user sees more than visible data names for output file only B ; directly after combination , copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. ) &quot;
&quot; if two folders are combined and the option of new file will be activated ( uns@@ afe ) , then exam@@ ines &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. While such errors are not eliminated , the folder cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file after the other works . it status column shows Fer@@ tig , when the meeting was successful , and according to other news if something unexpected is finished , you should be able to review and see if the status is in order everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparable analysis is chosen , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ cann@@ y , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for dissolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or combined . ) &quot;
&quot; you can select either selected entry ( file or O@@ dner ) , or all entries once . if you have selected all merge promotions ( also in all sub@@ missions ) , you can start the merge . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no target file , then it will be used in three @-@ folder merge mode C as the target , when two @-@ file association will be chosen and when synchron@@ ize A and / or B as a target . &quot;
&quot; if you select a target folder , please check if all entries must be displayed in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . there are some options to avoid un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
to summar@@ ize all entries : select directories and continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key element ) . to run the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if due to contra@@ dict@@ ory data types still invali@@ d merge actions , a message appears on the faulty elements . you can select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you perform all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options run , simulation and break . &quot;
&quot; select Sim@@ ulations if you would like to see what would happen , without that really changes . you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( combined with a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re done with a file , select again directories and press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t stored yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; see a mistake , message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you can see some error messages that will help you try to solve the cause of the problem or to solve the problem , or to solve the problem , before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were together individually , it shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries are not together again . even if the merge version was not stored or not stored , these entries will be done as well . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Settings Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... ) now has a section called directory interaction with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree . do several patterns be entered with a Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( eg . * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is not equal to this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern , do not appear in the elem@@ ental tree . it can use more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern , do not appear in the elem@@ ental tree . it can use more than a pattern , use the Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ der characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CV@@ S . many autonomous files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a version attribute . in other file system marks a previous point file . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elem@@ ental tree or not . this option is switched on . &quot;
&quot; in links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic link is compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to the links . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; in links to folders : if the option is switched off , the links will be switched on . if the option is switched on , the links like normal files will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that the links would lead to a link in itself . ) This option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; a complete analysis of each file leads through and shows the statistics columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ chy , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and significantly slower when used on files that contain no text . ( specify an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folder via a slow network , it may possibly be faster , just the change of date and file size . however , this speed advantage is a certain degree of security . please note that this option is switched off . &quot;
similar to confidenti@@ ality date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical if they are equal to the same . that can be useful when copying the change date is lost . please note this option in default .
&quot; activ@@ ating the synchron@@ ization mode if two folders are compared and no target file is specified . in this mode , proposals will be selected , and the results of the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead , the copy of the newer file is suggested than action . ( this is assumed that the other file has not been changed . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in any case . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced , then the original version is renamed and then the extension .@@ original . if an old backup file with the .@@ original extension is already existing , this option will also be switched on . this option is switched on . this option is switched on . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ merge views are visible to the merge files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want to switch the option to the directory &amp; text window , you can switch to the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably , you prefer to compare a file via double @-@ click . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also use a single file via the merge menu . as soon as you save the result , the status is set up and the file will not be merged when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost , if you read the directory : directory menu : read new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with help from K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders that you can open to local or remote computer .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder inside a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has another syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should notice :
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ one or .. . that &apos;s not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished , whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions , or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( please note the option of trust in size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of the purpose is currently as a differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right button of mouse over the difference menu and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part out of the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is applied as a part file , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files in the Uni@@ fied format is required . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch is to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if not the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the production of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is done , it only supports the same of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the merge or the same folder is not supported in the part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s com@@ edy ) is already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it may lead to the program diff@@ 3 out of the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection . &quot;
I &apos;ve been using GP@@ L programs for very long and have learned a lot in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programm@@ ers who have gone this way or go to it .
&quot; you probably have compiled the program from sources and configure the configure script . in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not be installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you can find more information about this issue . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are treated as the same ; but if not only a white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F @-@ lines of next to Each other , this characteristic of this is about the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers all the difference in the files where it begins and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to create a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and select the button file , and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared , and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&quot; &amp; C@@ diff@@ 3 ; used for many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more her@@ b@@ ulation would be conf@@ using , and missed the purpose . please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and trou@@ bles@@ hooting came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or later .
information about how you can use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of last changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ ic or in the Ch@@ ell package .
&quot; to comp@@ ile and install on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic file of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
K@@ DE @-@ you gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are uns@@ afe , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake , you should not have any problems with the comp@@ ile . if you have problems arise , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ list . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ sch@@ alt Rem@@ ove ) into the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board on the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders , not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to restart changes to these options using the Re@@ alization function . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries to be displayed , which are differences to differences . if the target folder does not contain these files , they are missing in a later program version . ( the behavior will probably be switched on in a later program version . ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window . if the lines are already available , they will be removed during clicking on the button . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . understanding of individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature show of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the current programs on the work@@ space , to change their size , to finish or move it . this works both within a work@@ space as well as at several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual working areas as well as the current applications . applications can be selected and even moved on the work@@ space and to others .
&quot; with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a work@@ space and other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; clicking on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click here , the context menu and the name of the application as well as entries , maxim@@ ize , working area and order . commands are : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of work@@ space . appears only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only if it was cli@@ cked on a application .
&quot; this landing field is selected , the window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the medium mouse button on the work@@ space and also to other work areas . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , you will see in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the name of virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; check this field , display the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual working areas . it &apos;s along with name display , the names are provided with ordin@@ ation numbers , &amp; cover ; 1 . working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background each working area is also displayed as a background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed . otherwise , only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed in order to enable their selection . &quot;
here is the view of the program window . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with their default symbol and pixel map displays a small view of the real program code . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can appear : classi@@ cally lets &amp; K@@ p@@ ager appear ; in some other window managers , like from P@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a vertical series , which is very good for the representation of the side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to P@@ ager Mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , the windows as symbols or with their contents can be modified and can also run outside the control bar . &quot;
clicking on the right button of mouse within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and followed by switch switch ... lets you appear the dialog settings .
&quot; currently , it cannot be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t want to register as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file , you need to enter the key win@@ dow@@ ent mode or to make this a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a functional installation of the K@@ DE basic packages . &quot;

&quot; &amp; I like ; is a screenshot of screen . you can enlarge one of the screen . this application is interesting for different users . this application includes artists , web designers and people with an visual effect . this documentation is supposed to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; I like ; is a very high performance application , which is constantly expanding to new features . it is optimised for use on high performance machines . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t like it , a window appears as above . the main window of &amp; k@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . the image that is displayed in the enlargement window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described in the following selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , it is enlarged ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mov@@ able l@@ ump . alternatively , you can add a selected screen area in the enlargement window ( eg . selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen edge ( eg . on the left side ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that it is not yet able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with arrows and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window , and keep the left mouse button , so you can capture the content of the magni@@ fication . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition , if you use the &amp; Shift key ; press , pressing &amp; M@@ MB ; use the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window will remain and only the lower right corner to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; I like ; possesses a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , to copy a file into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts , or stops the updating of the display . the stop of updating the update causes the required CPU time against 0 . &quot;
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , Ho@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will display . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; I like ; automatically uses your set short command to store files , opening a new window , printing , ne@@ ul@@ ades ( with the button document re@@ load in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and pul@@ p &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; also known as &amp; k@@ ron@@ fier ; is a screenshot of screen . you can use &amp; k@@ ron@@ fier ; for this application , you can use a micro@@ scope to use the small printed in a paper or photo . this application is for different people of benefits : from research or artists to web designer or t@@ end@@ han@@ dicapped people . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same place , it is thought to help people who prepar@@ es the RS@@ I Syndrome ( repet@@ itive @-@ al@@ ant @-@ In@@ depend@@ ant syndrome ) and those each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it is thought to help people who em@@ ulate pain in the repet@@ itive strain of In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and anyone can em@@ ulate pain . this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain , which is caused by the mouse , and helps to use so many people to connect the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can depend on pain that are related to use of your computer , if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to get it once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps that when clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that caused by the use of the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonom@@ ics aid : the result can be used for each different . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse click once you break the movement shortly .
&quot; the smart shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after the pressing of the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement . the smart shifts also requires a little exercise , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the mouse movement , this ref@@ us@@ al must be stored under the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; Intel@@ li@@ gent@@ es is switched on , the fil@@ feld shift time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before the mouse button is waiting for , if there is no problem due to the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse shift . if this function is activated , a slower effect on the right and back , followed by a break , click on left and back . these movements will be launched in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can cut &amp; K@@ DE ; to sh@@ orten the reaction time . open on Sound &amp; Multimedia , select the sound system and click here the tab . there is a sliding sound buffer , set up on a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at any start of &amp; K@@ DE ; it is currently only available under &amp; K@@ DE ; please contact the respective documentation to figure out how you will start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all the settings back to the values which were set at the opening of the dialog . have you already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the status after the last pressing of users . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , smart shifts should be switched off initially . if you have to get used to the automatic mouse , you can later take the intelligent shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places remains a mouse click without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on positions in the browser window that do not lead to un@@ intenti@@ oned reactions . you can park the mouse in such places until you would like to use them again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is ru@@ ck@@ le , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the Maus@@ ball . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you must take out the mouse ball . as it happens , it is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear when you watch the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the Loch@@ es , into which the ball was inserted . the Dre@@ ck and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system interru@@ pts the version of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you &apos;re just a shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer end by rele@@ asing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click . this is the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to run mouse click and sets the cur@@ sor to another spot . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor position to place where you want to place it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of work@@ space , if you are able to handle the mouse button on a neutral area &amp; cover ; the gray surfaces around the tool@@ bars and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to add it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add to any other action , while using the mouse with pressing mouse button . however , some advice are likely to be prepared . here are some advice : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift if you just start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead , in the way : run a mouse button , while you move the mouse button to the other end of the text and move the mouse button to another end . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . therefore , each time you use when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse presses a sound like a mouse click . so you can also know how to use smart phones without the audi@@ ble click . however , you need some exercise . &quot;
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X window ; it should be installed on most system .
&quot; the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available , if the system has a sound card and loud@@ speaker and this correctly set up correctly . &quot;
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; put the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter . this program has been developed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and preparing the bet@@ ting of the bri@@ ga@@ ze pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process before the mouse button can be extingu@@ ished . in this way , the goat can also be carried out with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the m@@ ute users can speak to their computer for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , m@@ ute users can speak the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the talk pro@@ positions , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first side of the assistant ( left screen photo ) , enter the command , which later will be used later for the language edition of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second side , select the default text password textbook . you can often choose text passages , without being typ@@ ing . the text passages can be edited , of course . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right screenshot ) , you determine the dictionary for the word of word . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can use the word lists with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correct sp@@ elling words can be taken into the word . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth is clear and contains essentially an input field for the key editing of your pro@@ positions ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a running memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in screen photo ) .
&quot; if you k@@ mouth , you can set the sets right in the input field you want to hear . each spoken sentence is attached to the running memory . you can choose from this pro@@ positions which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; open ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two boxes , speech output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ most and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the cart@@ card language issue , enter the command for the voice of the language . in the selection field under the input field , enter the character encoding , with the lyrics to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types , to pass the text . select the check box , if the text remains unchanged as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text is added as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language output of your language generator . you will find this command in documentation to your language generator . examples here in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service will be used &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first attempt to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a standard &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ d@@ us@@ on , the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Applications is a standardized interface for language output and the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by key passage or by choosing a text passage in the text box book or text of text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen text in passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the running memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will initially only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , the editing book for text@@ books , you can define whether the text font book should be saved automatically . &quot;
&quot; in order to save the textbook , the book is stored . if you select changes , the textbook book is not stored . select before saving , it will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the textbook should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the site of Wor@@ ter@@ ity contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ field . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth , a selection box , where this list can be used for more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list you can set the name and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source , select the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation one . the frequency of the individual words is simply obtained by means of the list . in addition , you can compare the word list using a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to be just correct written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can summar@@ ize the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , asks those dic@@ tion@@ aries together , and how these weights are expected . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you will create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; re@@ issued words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary using your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the window for processing of text @-@ pass@@ ers is divided . in the upper part , the text matching books are represented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you select a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding keyboard . if you select a textbook , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books , add or select selected text passages and books , either via the choice in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; order the sequence of text passages or text passages , you can change with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key changes . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , the otherwise selected areas of the run storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , the otherwise selected areas of the run storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . in case of text in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected phr@@ ases of the run storage . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is checked , a shift tool@@ bar with buttons used for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged directly under the processing window directly under the menu bar . through mouse click on the sh@@ orted left side and pulling , the tool@@ bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow dead in the lower part of the main window with Hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hat@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a shift of text for text matching books with entries is displayed . the LEICA can be moved directly under the processing window directly under the tool @-@ mounted left side and drag , the tool bar can be moved to another spot . &quot;
&quot; probably , you have not entered the command for the voice issue correctly or not completely entered . open the Settings Settings ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for the speech output language output . ( see section dialog for speech syn@@ thesizer ) . &quot;
&quot; the University of Edinburgh is a language edition of the University of Edinburgh . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ cally supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and continue with restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of command line for setting the language output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is an in &amp; Java ; written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows for free to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restrictions .
&quot; in order to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language edition , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ aks . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command examples : &quot;
for the third example the option has to send data as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it turns a list of phon@@ ies into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei . therefore you need an additional program to use the text into phon@@ eme . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text to phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / mb@@ rol@@ a are installed . &quot;
&quot; sorry , H@@ adi@@ fax to make the last character of the text , so an extra sign must be added . the full order is therefore more costly than in the other examples : &quot;

K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems .
&quot; as the voice of the language is done only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use the kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to setting the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which is installed in the dialog dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally storage for the language generator ) , which depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application that cannot speak with the people who cannot speak to the text by the calcul@@ ator . it is stored a list of pro@@ spective pro@@ positions which can still be re@@ compens@@ ated again . &quot;

&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; - the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; - is one of modules existing service , which allows each application to read the text about the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a part system in &amp; K@@ DE ; for language output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; K@@ DE ; programmer ready to be equipped with their applications using T@@ TS skills . the users can also offer interesting options .
read texts ( or parts of it ) in the text editor &amp; Kate ; even if &amp; Kate ; in other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are embedded .
&quot; the language edition takes place via the program of @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the creation of language editions on the command line ( or with Shell scripts ) over the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus program .
&quot; in the future : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ice@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ met@@ a @-@ language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the language edition of &amp; K@@ DE ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services via &amp; D@@ bus ; offers . &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d via kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts .
a module for the text editor &amp; Kate ; with which a text file can be read or partially read .
&quot; in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( htt@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find the list of htt@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility . the developers can also be found in IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # K@@ DE @-@ Acc@@ essi@@ bility ) . &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ops , you &apos;ll need to install program @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as many speakers are set up , the card board is displayed . see also . if you have set at least one speaker , the card card is shown . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or such that differ in volume or speed . you should also set multiple variants for syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least one speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ops . otherwise , the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several print versions for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the cart@@ on card speakers in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card board is displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all furnished actors appear in this list . the preferred speaker appear in the list . the top speaker is used for the language edition if an application has no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list below . the sequence of speaker in the list also determines their priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
&quot; here , choose a voting type , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ cture and girl agree . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker appears on the cart@@ card speakers . to change the settings of this speaker , click on . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ops . you go back to the card card , and check if language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is running , so the T@@ TS @-@ service of &amp; K@@ DE ; starting . now you can read &amp; kt@@ ops . Click here to read text orders to create and manage text orders . &quot;
&quot; if you have set at least one speaker , you can start the play@@ list of &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the cart@@ onboard map of General to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops . this start is successful , the card card orders will be displayed and you can read text orders and read them . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is terminated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the box will enable language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is highlighted and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically at the pre @-@ read system control bar , it dis@@ appears once the pre @-@ read is completed . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can start text orders , stop and take up again . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; cli@@ p@@ board or read a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; on users or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD was started . in order to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ on map of General and cross the language edition ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ops . read the text that you should read , and select the main menu tools text . after a short time , the language edition should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also ski@@ p this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pre@@ tension lines and other un@@ visible stamps are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text . check first , whether &amp; kt@@ ops . then check the text that should be read , and select the main menu tools text . then you should start the language output . &quot;
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; quantitative ;
&quot; K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE , which you notify about you determined events . you can read the text of this messages also by &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various types of messages ; for example , you can inform yourself if you are noti@@ fied , in which your nick@@ name is coming . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can read the IR@@ C message text in an IR@@ C message . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu entry into the menu settings of this program . here are possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ according to application . &quot;
&quot; the file could provide a good example in &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is a good example . it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the news , the K@@ Mail , and in addition to the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as required . read also . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filtering it will be edited text , before he will be sent to the program of @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation of pron@@ oun@@ cing words or abbrevi@@ ations , or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the work of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; distingu@@ ishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be moved to all other orders , and maintains these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the commis@@ sions will be continued again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this level is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . while you &amp; cover ; a long text on a website can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth . please read the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ noti@@ fications are also news . read about it .
&quot; the rest are simple text@@ books . each order , which you encounter orders , is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications using text orders . text orders are intended for the issue longer texts , which have no particular pressures . &quot;
&quot; all four sub@@ types of order will be cancelled in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ops . just such a read , this issue will hold and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to know that filters never be applied to the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . they will be applied to normal war@@ nings , news and text orders as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
filters work the text and add it to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are implemented as modules . in the future there can still be more types of filters .
&quot; replace parts of a text by other text . it can be delivered either as words , or as regular expressions . it will enable you to replace chat @-@ E@@ moti@@ fs such as : - ) by text or for the conversion of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; re@@ former using a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into a different format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops , there are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML included . &quot;
&quot; with speaking positions , you can depend on the content of text or depending on the program that send text on &amp; kt@@ ops . if you have sent a female voice on a speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages , you can read about that . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filter has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a language edition . if the filter is determined that its rules are not applicable , the text remains unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; K@@ DE ; notification on &amp; kt@@ ops ; it will be processed by all activated filters which have been set up in the list below . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filter . is a filter not crossed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be moved from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; Click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be shown below the following introduc@@ tory dialog@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; for the setup of character sequences , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . then these patterns will be exchanged in text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name . you can choose to choose from the name of the other filters only . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the string in the column match and replaces it with the string from the column . the list is shown in the displayed sequence from above .
Click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can upload a list of words or regular expressions out of a file , save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language version , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the languages spoken here . Click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you press the mouse click &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; press . &quot;
&quot; here is a value , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you can use the q@@ d@@ bus program using the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Num@@ bers ; -@@ Num@@ bers , you need to set it . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only copy it . &quot;
&quot; the string will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box of Di@@ esen filters if match . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compar@@ ing words , the identification filter filter is used in the form \ \ s word \ \ s. these words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ator ( space character ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no guidance for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&quot; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ er transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format in different format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such de@@ formation . but it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c has to be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; in the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c , enter the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can send text to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can design@@ ate that texts of k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ops , a text to the filters are looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker will be selected on the speaker &apos;s speaker , which is selected the text on &amp; kt@@ ops . you can send and the characteristics of the speaker speaker speaker , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value set , the filter is applied , if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regul@@ ators , you can get this with a click on the button to get help with the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to en@@ roll the regular expression at the beginning of the character string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here , place the characteristics of the desired speaker conditions . if the text shown above shown filter conditions , the speaker is selected to list the desired requirements on the right . Click on the button to preview the dialogue speaker selection . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save your speaker settings , or to download or delete all settings . &quot;
the speaker extension filter is only applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box of Di@@ esen filters if applicable . they need to apply at least one condition .
&quot; the language API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing &amp; kt@@ ops to use this syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; the following section includes a brief description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ bus ; -@@ interface of the language API of &amp; K@@ DE ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is , you can find on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) . &quot;
applications call for language information on the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; K@@ DE ; by the program kt@@ ts@@ d on the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text for reading and option is a language code as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are still more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start a kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for the festival Web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able doesn &apos;t work at all . you can also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and you need to find out the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
certain characters or interaction signs seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that all phr@@ ases may be ski@@ pped or only Kau@@ der@@ wel@@ sch . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first of all , make sure the option is set to the right value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may be fixed by a character conversion filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license that you can find in the associated documentation or on the relevant web pages . there are also voices that own an own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the k@@ de@@ out package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can download the source code of k@@ de@@ de under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / . &quot;

&quot; American , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ wah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza organic . &quot;
KT@@ TS is also working with every language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console ;
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , see the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thesizer . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ops for use of another syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , use the Develop@@ er team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and XML ; conversion filter is not necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; kt@@ ops , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the k@@ deli@@ bs and the Develop@@ ing Files for the program &quot; &quot; @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code of &amp; kt@@ ops , refer to the source archive for k@@ de@@ ma or you have installed every night in Tar@@ ball , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you are using &amp; kt@@ ops , check first if the @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ scription Code @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops , which is used as the program of @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be extended and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text will be crushed in single sentences . the user can go , repeat , or cut off , repeat the output or break off . &quot;
&quot; if a application is based on &amp; kt@@ ops , you can request the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the issue . if you have a speaker furnished , whose language is English and whose sex is female , it will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ops are chosen , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker , click on the box and click on the list , the card speaker speaker systems will be shown . as an example , the box speaker for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . when the path is included in P@@ AT@@ H , you must only enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the text encoding for text , which will be handed over to the festival . for voices , the &amp; kt@@ ops are done . generally speaking , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , use eastern languages such as Czech or slo@@ v@@ ak@@ ian , use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , you can adjust the volume , speaking speed and sound level of synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some kno@@ b , and you can &apos;t select this grey voice to select this settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices such as multi@@ Sy@@ n votes are loaded , due to their size many seconds to be loaded . if you are loaded this check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized by the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with higher memory consumption ) the first set faster is syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set any speaker ( or forget to click on users ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is shown at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr the program window t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , the program window is visible in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this landing field is marked and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is read a text , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD has read a text . thus , you have the opportunity to stop or to control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the waiting line , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of pro@@ positions and the straight set set . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the board card spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can return a day in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes of the settings ( including on other boxes cards ) and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the cart@@ card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and administ@@ rated . editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern , War@@ nings and News are not shown . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ops are available . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , it was compiled &amp; kt@@ ops ; either without support for the corresponding audio module , it cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to install at least one module , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
set the speech speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % is equivalent to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % of the double normal speed speed . so that these settings can be implemented if the program SO@@ x has to be installed .
Click on users to take the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this cardboard card , you can set up special actions that will always be implemented if the text order from a message is interrupted with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of speech orders : &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern has the highest priority . it will be moved to all other orders , and maintains these orders . after the issue of the screen reader was read , the received orders will be taken again . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important messages like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; News have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application to read the news . if you &amp; eg , you can find a long text on a web site , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcomed the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ops ; the audio output into queu@@ es long . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played , when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sounds are active as well as introduc@@ tory news , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card card only applies to normal text orders . for news , war@@ nings and the issues of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ ars there are no particular actions , when they are interrupted by a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ops ; K@@ Noti@@ fy reading news , start kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the card card messages appears . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to switch to the reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ops ; read no noti@@ fications before . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button , a dialog appears that you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that send &amp; conversation ; if someone mentioned in an IR@@ C message to your nick@@ name .
&quot; all events that are found in the list nothing else , will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; use this selection box to determine what &amp; kt@@ ops , should do when an event takes place . they have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected custom text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the features of the desired speaker . default , select the speaker , which is displayed on the list of boxes speakers as the top entry . see also . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a specific event has been specified for any specific application , this promotion is executed . otherwise the action for all other events of the specific application is executed . as the last option , the action is set to carry , which is specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this reason , you can follow the noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button to store the settings for the noti@@ fications into a file . use the button to store stored settings from a file . if you want to start the events in the list . if you want to delete the events in the list , click on delete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a voice issue . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , the volume , the volume of the voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently &amp; kt@@ ts supports ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you have to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used by the SS@@ ML output . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or sound system in the festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ ot@@ on . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ positi@@ onal filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . this can also be syn@@ thes@@ ized text in single pro@@ positions , because only the first proposition must be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order . so you can also stop or stop the box , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ pane limit filter . during the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops , it will automatically be set up as a pro@@ positi@@ onal sign filter . you can change its settings or add further pro@@ positi@@ onal filters , but they are rounded off . &quot;
&quot; on the easiest way , you can learn the establishment of the speaker selection menu and enter text in advance . check the speaker selection back and check out how the speaker selection process has changed . you must naturally have set more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops , then faster with the reading can begin , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last long , &quot;
&quot; you can stop essays on the card card , or if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this feature . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the regular sat@@ z@@ im@@ itation filter is automatically set up when you &apos;re using kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be removed only . change nothing at this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
compare output filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ ving and add a t@@ ul@@ atory sign ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the sat@@ in borders ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) . note that the standard pro@@ positi@@ onal sign will be automatically taken from the text ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( cold ) , war@@ nings , messages or the issue of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal pro@@ positi@@ onal filters , you can insert this again by charging the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card card speaker selection , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the card card is displayed if &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speech properties defined .
&quot; use the most suitable microphone , which has all the properties of a furnished speaking speaker . if you don &apos;t delete the speaker &apos;s settings . otherwise you choose &amp; kt@@ ops . otherwise you choose &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise it cho@@ oses the speaker , which was originally set to the original properties . &quot;
select the method to input the desired speaker characteristics by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the characteristics of the desired speaker . if this feature is no part , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; check out this check box , if the property should have preferred before other features . you can also put several markings here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding , this feature is always treated as a priority feature . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language , if you may know that a specific application is sent in another language than that in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the field of actors , using the most likely to delete the default , click on the selection button , and then apply on speakers that corresponds to the subject . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in queu@@ e long . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I do not get tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ops . probably you have to register G@@ stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved yet . if the problem is not solved then you may update G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to install G@@ Stre@@ amer .
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops . a message that says : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , the problem is that conflicts in AL@@ SA occur that they can prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . hints for potential solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) under www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I have an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I have installed them and can use it in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices are added to the new voice . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; where you have found the voice to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio card , there is an setting speed . so this is working , the program SO@@ x installed and via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some Syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ oes such as Festival Interactive offer a adjustment for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speaking speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ops ; &amp; HTML ; read it either that the HTML in SS@@ ML is converted . ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ sl file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set the microphone speed up . &quot;
&quot; I do not create that websites with a female voice read . I have set a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . to change the X@@ SL file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate character filter filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ops . no more sat@@ in or return . on the cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter orders will be displayed , the order stand up only from a proposition . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; file signs ( point , question@@ ing , pron@@ unci@@ ation , comm@@ a and Sem@@ ik@@ ol@@ on ) may not filter out . use for this character instead of a filter for pro@@ positi@@ onal detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts in the audio output . if your system counts , you cannot play music simultaneously and read a text if you can start a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ops , the current proposition will still be read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ x is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs are already included . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . at many voices you can adjust volume , speaking speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that will be supplied with the festival . if you want to read Web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to comp@@ ile an additional module , therefore you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations . &quot;
&quot; this voice uses the Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / Vo@@ ices / Russian / . if you enter the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select an C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit@@ - ) encoding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; district distri@@ butions . please choose Festival as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the code must be set to a 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used jointly with the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; it will take over the le@@ x@@ ic@@ ulture analysis and &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; -@@ program and the &amp; mb@@ rol@@ a ; voices can be downloaded from

&quot; epic is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer for Czech and Slov@@ ak@@ ian language . it is a simple speech syn@@ thesizer with still sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ops , you can only adjust the volume at this language syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; take kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the cart@@ on board , click on adding . select the c@@ zech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian language and ep@@ s T@@ TS @-@ language syn@@ thesizer . if the ep@@ ist@@ le programs are not available in your P@@ AT@@ H , you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; ep@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff language syn@@ thesizer which has been written in &amp; Java ; i.e. , you need to install the &amp; Java ; virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can neither sound height , volume or sound speed . &quot;
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ops using any language syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line can be controlled .
&quot; you can use a command to send the language output into a temporary audio file ( wav ) , instead of sending the output directly to audio files . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ controller ; which allows management of network interfaces , the rout@@ ings and the DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and des@@ kt@@ op@@ settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; can be called by selecting from K menu @-@ control@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file ; creating a simple surface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ controller ; displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ control@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in the &amp; k@@ menu ; started . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured to show &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device is at all and allows setting of network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers are installed for network hardware and other devices at the inst@@ al@@ ers of &amp; Linux ; with installed and installed . network appliances later added , the driver will need to be loaded by adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version . &quot;
&quot; the network network settings will be charged if the network settings will be selected in the &amp; k@@ control@@ center ; -@@ Index option , this network is trying to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be detected , the hanging selection is offered . it is the platform from the list which can be hit permanently . by marking the setting non @-@ again questions can be set permanently . next start of network settings , this selection will be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; the change of network settings can only be possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed , which means that settings can only be viewed , modify the button mode at the right bottom of the module . it is necessary to input the password mode . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the whole functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the tab network interface serves to manage the network appliances of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the tab network interfaces , the following tasks can be carried out : &quot;
the settings of the network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button ... in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button Advanced Settings displays the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are made from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at any system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with a selection of Manu@@ ally , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP configuration will be made . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; this setting is selected , the system initi@@ ates the network interface in bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values set in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device box .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch @-@ on network device takes place by selecting from the list and click interface ....
network devices can be activated or switched off . switch on a activated network device takes place by selecting from the list and click interface ....
&quot; the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net fixed , which convey@@ s the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface must be selected , in which the Gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator with DNS support replaces the corresponding IP address . that is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the calcul@@ ator htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ solves this name to an IP address like about 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the riding solution allows a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed , or changed . DNS entries can be arranged by selecting a single paper or post @-@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons up or down in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button to add ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver . &quot;
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group machine to name resolution , select one entry and then click on the button .... It will display dialog . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes the computer @-@ to @-@ IP address reference to the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it will be used in the first line with bo@@ oting , if no DNA server are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
usually the list contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported . this still in the test version of IP shall replace in the future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known computer and click on adding .... The dialog New alias is displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well known host and click the button . if the known calcul@@ ator has several alias @-@ names , de button adding several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select an entry of a well @-@ known machines from the list and select Edit .... The dialog W@@ ant Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be set in a &amp; console ; the following command is set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough when &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in one &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface can be used as k@@ package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; not , but in addition , development plans are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this will only be experienced users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands should afford this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file will be discussed . &quot;
this range can &apos;t replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information will be convey@@ ed on the integration of the PCs into a small ( home @-@ ) network .
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) . for example , 5 has never found large spread . IPv6 is expected to be found in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge that IP address of a network interface is attributable to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace administrator can be used or if available , D@@ H@@ CP will not be selected . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from one specially for this purpose , to avoid IP address associated with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , therefore it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can access the Internet for such machines through setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , most of the addresses are used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ proof ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , which is second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own computer ) . the standard route is required for IP transfer . &quot;
&quot; the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in local own machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
&quot; in this part , the configuration files are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file sometimes changed by DSL connections sometimes , so it is not surprised if in the case of active DSL connections there is another content to be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the opportunity to create several archives on a band . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which presented my wife : how much longer it takes , when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; k@@ dat . that can be done on three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ires the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information about the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ elling on the band will not be asked whether the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the presentation , searches it after the appropriate index on your plate . can this be found , you will be asked if the band index should be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the symbol changes for the tape drive to indicate that the band was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before dis@@ card the ban@@ ker , first the integration of the tape must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; gives you an amendment to the symbol for the band , that the integration of the band has been solved and shows an appropriate message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without any danger . &quot;
&quot; before a band of &amp; k@@ dat may be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not have to format the format at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted before using the band from &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not have to form@@ at@@ ted a tape before use of the tape , DA@@ T drives on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat , with the format of the tape . all data on the band go lost ! after completion of the form@@ att@@ ing process the band will be integrated automatically and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the c@@ auti@@ ous files . this can be done on three ways : &quot;
select one file or folder in the local file tree . it is secured only to this file or folder .
mark a safety profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be secured .
mark files in the local file tree with a skins . only those selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click the local file tree and select the menu with ... &quot;
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialog settings are opening up . in this dialog you can check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , the dialog appears . dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
mark a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is checked only the selected file or folder .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a ham@@ lets . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click one of the archives and select the menu entry . &quot;
&quot; once the testing process has been launched , the dialog settings will appear for checking . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for checking , the dialog appears . this dialogue shows the progress of the test process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can restart the re , the files must be restored , must be selected . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select one file or folder in one of the archives , which includes entry for the tape drive . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder are restored . &quot;
mark the desired files from one of the archives with a skins . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folder are restored .
&quot; with the right mouse button , click one file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process has been launched , dialogue settings for restoration . in this dialog you can check your selection and change the work folder for the restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the restoration , the dialog appears re@@ produce . this dialogue shows the progress of recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the band inde@@ x@@ file using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
this is a ensuring profile profile with the just selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings :
&quot; the current work folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of c@@ auti@@ ous files will be updated automatically , accordingly to the right @-@ elected work@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under securing files , only the files are stored in the same file system , like the folder . file that are located on the same file system , you can enter separately under backup files . every entry is considered tar independently from the other . &quot;
&quot; in order to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files are secured that since then have changed . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine changes since the last incre@@ mental f@@ use . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files was not completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings on the menu option ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device node for the tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ recur@@ ring version of the band device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the band is tied to the drive . for some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
the option is switched on to un@@ lock &amp; k@@ dat ; it is not working for tape drives . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
&quot; if the option is switched on , the volume is switched off by &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically use the band using Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware block size is switched on . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band is form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file on the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a storage block on the tape . the contents of the file sets itself as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host name : seconds , whereby machine name is form@@ at@@ ted to the band . seconds is the number of seconds that have been form@@ at@@ ted since the ep@@ och , which has been form@@ at@@ ted since the ep@@ och . &quot;
the band ID will be used to find a file using the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
&quot; the remaining files on the band are pure tar -@@ Archives , which are directly communic@@ ated directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not around in@@ corporate f@@ uses . &quot;
check the content of a backup . this symbol is only active when a band is bound .
&quot; &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ viewer for system protocols . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , where you can get information on your system , or where the system allows information on your system or where the system enables quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; helps users understand what your hosts is in the background . it is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for un@@ experienced users , which can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system , or where the system can get the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; experienced users can provide quick access to information about problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some extended functions , which can be filtered and evaluated using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in current version 0.@@ 4.1 owns &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server , and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other features are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this hand@@ book .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions available , with which help the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filters and sort . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters will be shown in the next chapter of this hand@@ book . &quot;
&quot; after launching &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; initially , the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be displayed , and it will be opening up with a small news window , so you don &apos;t have a system compatible with Linux / var / log , for the normal user usually don &apos;t have a permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also filter the filter bar in order to filter after a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or to filter strings . in the default setting , the selection box is displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line is displayed only when in one of the columns contain the filter search engine . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another record at this point . select the string search engine , then select the column process , and enter also in the filter bar the name of a process , so show you &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of stage error are displayed with a striking color as a protocol lines . the colour display of protocol lines can be switched on .
&quot; for example , you would like to show certain process ( for example in system protocol or on the cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can investigate the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command such as the start of Sam@@ ba server . in this case you use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can activate the option to the new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; allows the display of several protocol files in separate sub@@ strate . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage the entries in the menu to display a protocol . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ System@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software .@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further current information on the sources of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ System@@ log ; also find in the following file of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion Archives : ks@@ System@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; system V In@@ it editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads some concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it system develops quickly to the standard for control of the program start at the end of the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects ( among others because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because perhaps someone could try to determine a machine on system V In@@ it , without a new installation and re@@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
the SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it also diff@@ ers from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need to start a script for any system service , which you want to start at the high speed of the system or when switching to another Run@@ level . system services include such things such as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things such as set@@ serial , which only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should be part under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if it &apos;s not much use for this . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ 0 in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
&quot; the kernel is searching for different places after the program , and starts the first one that he finds . &quot;
the default Run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . they should see the following line as follows :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre @-@ puri@@ fied Run@@ level 3 is possible . if you want to change that , then you can reset / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . if you want to change anything , then you &apos;ll be reset by adding the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you ls -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no right files in this folder . instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
&quot; how does and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop . you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would read the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the K contains , the script will be called on the argument . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to build machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server @-@ level , which can run only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition I could even run a user @-@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say tri@@ vial : simply pull one entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can change scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level , taking it elsewhere . this will only happen if it comes to an entry from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this happens only if they pull out an entry from the available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries will be moved , if you want to copy them in a new range . in order to select only a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select from the menu menu or select from the context menu , and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes . in such a case , you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore entries , which were thrown into the paper basket . so , be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to activate the various working ranges ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually , press button to switch between different fields . connect the tab@@ ulator button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
&quot; all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c , if it is available . otherwise , they are returned by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; re@@ produced . changes to the pre@@ ferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . &quot;
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode , then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be order ) . &quot;
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) , you &apos;ll need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the species , such as system services are launched in these distri@@ butions , is simplified the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available ( and also , whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) are simply without message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about Run@@ time , so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
&quot; this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program , you can manage users and groups of your system . &quot;
to start with &amp; user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ; to read .
&quot; after you have made modifications , you need to save them . either use the appropriate symbol of tool@@ bar or entry saving in the File File . &quot;
&quot; &amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two board cards , the user - and the desired group . for example , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics . &quot;
&quot; some boxes can only be displayed if you have expanded expanded system settings . only if you have extended system settings , you will be able to create individual settings , if shadow passwords , or for example , etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD formats . &quot;
&quot; the card password scheme appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD formats . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard card only appears , if for at least one built @-@ in file system limit ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the rate quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters for each user , with the limited capacity of details in KB are : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system .
&quot; the card @-@ card groups inform@@ s the group associated users of the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the Field prime group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by marking them in the big field . &quot;
dialogue features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select from the menu user or group or click on the suitable add @-@ button of tool@@ bar . editing or delete the selected user or selected group is analog@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the li@@ lo boat manager , remove the boot@@ password , remove and change the time up to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
