<seg id="479">& digium; represents three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but produces particularly in dark areas, graceful pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"unsharpening mask works on the contrast of the edges to look like a picture. actually, it is not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"Refocus is probably the best of the three, because it really improves the sharpness. he is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus, as well as most digitised pictures need a correction of the sharpness. elements that are smaller than the resolution will be combined with only minimum lower than the resolution. the same phenomenon can be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more retrospectively as normal cameras for the private user."</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG pictures often have been applied to a camera internal sharpening. pictures in the shell format however must always be weakened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners turn a sharpening filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by using a photo using the sharpening of sharpening. you can sharpening the menu with the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but you should avoid this, as the results are not very natural: sharpening the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the usable technique for sharpening the tool Refocus. in general, you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw a bit soft, is much easier than it to sharpening. use the tool to soften with the menu entry of the dialog box, and experiment with the menu entry on the right side of the dialog box shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove muer from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the picture. the background window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in radius or the amount reinforce the effect. if you make the unsharpness mask to be strong, noise and the impression of grats in the vicinity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius can be affected as many pixels on each side of an edge by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radien. therefore, you should use images in its final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the ignorant picture one of the original is added. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference between the amount of RGB value and it can be applied to the edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are exempt with a soft change between the killing and therefore beauty of water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp filter. the original picture is the (1) and the revised picture (2). unsharp masked, it was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiate; tool Refocus is focused on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected relief filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">"this tool tries a picture to & quot; refocusserenquot; in which it uses the deadline for sharpening the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese. it is usually achieved better results than unsharp masked. you can start the menu by using colors Refocus on the picture editing."</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular fuss works much better than the Gauß's Fishing. the Gauß's Fing has a very long tail, which leads to far from the original torques, which is widely influenced by the remote pixel. this causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular fuss. it is the most important parameters for use of this module. for most pictures should set the default value 1 good results. but you may have a higher value if your image should be very unsharp then but to Heiligenschein.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"catchfilter: an increase in the space filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values improve from 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise level is very bad. a useful value is 0,03. a high value will continue to decorate the image."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. use this parameter if your unsharpness gossip is caused. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 if you need to increase this value to 0, you may also increase the correlation and / or catastrophes."</seg>
<seg id="503">"MatrizenSize: this value determines good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gauß's sharpness. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"save as well as loading buttons are used exactly to this purposes. any precursor parameter is used for you, and then it can be loaded for later and then can be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color, and intolerance on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not immediately visible, but leave later unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and compressed, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed picture."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp usually produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by causing unsharp masked a bigger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it must always be unsharp. even under optimal conditions, it can never be able to remove any effect. for the Viennese filters you can still show that it is the optimum linearity filter. the FIR Viennese filter is often better with the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below, you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unfocused picture:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this image has been made with analogue camera. the unfocused result is due to unsufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information about the methods for sharpening methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">"the regulator is debutted the unsharpening of the area, in order to generate a more natural Pupille."</seg>
<seg id="514">"the color tinned allows a customized color for the pupils. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>

<seg id="516">The Inform Algorithm was developed by the IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cbeg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as a starting point to simplify the restoration. the default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings in a adjustment, you can use the rider believers and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed analysis p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glass view on the image. for greater values mainly homogenous regions smoothed and details are needed. a value of 0.9 should not be retrospectively necessary. please note that the details are always necessary."</seg>
<seg id="520">"sectional movement Alpha [0,100]: a small value is evenly distributed in all directions while a value of 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD noise, a high value of similar patterns will produce. JPEG artifacts are best eliminated at a value in the vicinity of 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all, then the relative smoothing. put this value for the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"rule: [0, 100]: this parameter is given greater structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothing. this is necessary if it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm run through. normally 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle breakdown [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected, there should be also small. be sure that small angle should be set for a long term. so you should choose this value so big and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step-wide in pixel. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel glasses, and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation: the more than quality you can get through the selection of this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to allow him.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons save as and store do exactly this. each setting of image errors can be corrected in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) that is used for the filter. great values increase the time the filter per pixel and can be pumped over the picture and the color in it is smoothed and so for smaller mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpening of the sharpness. if it is increased, noise pointed tips will be deleted. if the value is high, the adaptive filter image details may not be added, the adaptive filter image details may not get any more and remove noise or lubrication."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge accuracy of the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the frequency response can be removed or smoke tips can occur. put it on a value near the maximum, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the memory process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the colour tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not influence the memory process through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the Gammatolerance of the picture. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark areas, typically stronger than the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the adjustment of phasenjitterdamping. this value defined as quickly the adaptive filter radius to the variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges can appear, noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for that."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"if a picture is drawn with only a beam per pixel, different mistakes can be created. these pictures often have a Moirè pattern or stub effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not shown when they are in the representation smaller than a pixel. this effect is called Aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; used a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally you see pictures with this property better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn anti-aliasing, calculates and links & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super sampling is adjacent to the neighboring Pixum. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel becomes more split and adaptive because the recursioning loop depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray followed a beam per pixel. if the difference between color values are calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling, a grid value of 5 then 5x5 (25) will be charged additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference is divided between the following threshold values, the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixel, then the pixels will be checked and further subdivision. the maximum depth of records can be adjusted with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you turn off Jittering, changed & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map General MIDI events translates into events that understands synthesizer."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet, when originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and Gus cards, FM units and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you have to edit the appropriate file of hand (with your favorite seditor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that saves all necessary modifications to play a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except that KEYMAP section, which may often appear as desired. the requirement is, however, that each appearance is a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of Keymap... End Define KEYMAP" A further keymap "End Define CHANNELMAP... End options... End</seg>

<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that I can do in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, the cartridge of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the balance sheet is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that will need this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported by a tissue (e.g. with sound 60), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which can do the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (the drum), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which tone in the MIDI file stands."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term Trodrum patch of the patch is meant, in which each tone represents another percussioning instrument (drum, cymbals, Maracas & etc;) and is not the one that means sound the sound level of the same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to give how tones are depicted on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keyboards for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to form sounds on the perkward channel. watch out as an example the supplied keyboards.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to create some channels on others. if you want to change the first and the second channel, make it easy for the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap with the name is used for this channel. if you are using the keymap option, the Keymap is necessary to change the patch on this channel. if you're using the ForcePatch option, all events will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful for example to use the percolt patch on the perkward channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates that in which proportion of Pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if an MIDI file sends a Pitch-Bender event, this will be redirected by the formula n * (r / 4096) and then the value 4096 is used, thus in the map file no decimal places are used)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM is present that a keyboard, which is a Pitch-Bender event will be playing with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards to find two sounds up to a octave higher. to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid; try to try."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI Map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the canal view is a window with a whole row of piano (one for each MIDI channel). on these piano, you see what sounds are played straight."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the canal view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. if you find, a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about it, like a music piece. it contains the notes, the rhythm, speed, & etc; so that the same MIDI file can lead to very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes on very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needed 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc. you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably determine that the pre-purified Runlevel 3 is possible. if you want to change that, then you can reset / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you want to change anything, then you'll be reset by adding the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you ls -l enter in rc3.d, you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no right files in this folder. instead every entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of scripts is so written that there is an argument as start and stop. you can actually start this scripts out of hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would read the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the K contains, the script will be called on the argument. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to build machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server-level, which can run only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition I could even run a user-Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say trivial: simply pull one entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can change scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level, taking it elsewhere. this will only happen if it comes to an entry from its original Runlevel (or its position). this happens only if they pull out an entry from the available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved, if you want to copy them in a new range. in order to select only a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the menu menu or select from the context menu, and even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry can sometimes be calculated sometimes. in such a case, you must process the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore entries, which were thrown into the paper basket. so, be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the various working ranges (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection of upper or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move one entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>

<seg id="2983">"enter the lilo -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in a single user mode, then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be order)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you'll need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services are launched in these distributions, is simplified the configuration for proprietary integration programs of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available (and also, whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) are simply without message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the importance of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about Runtime, so that this manual can be added to this manual."</seg>
