although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely big .
&quot; how many of my generation I grew up with American films , I &apos;ve picked up American music , American authors and run his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the grand D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican Letter , who covered the Supreme Court of an oil painting with the help of Julia Roberts , who were over his interest , wanted to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only strengthened . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equality . &quot;
I even had a very weak love story about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about the tourism and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as it comes with his bott@@ led power . &quot;
&quot; he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , like a former colleague , and declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ american and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won with the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that ever reached by the party nomin@@ ate candidate . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person I asked myself ?
&quot; I could not met Tr@@ ump and his voters in harmony with people , which I met during my time in Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; like for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , people out of all over the world , a deep gl@@ aci@@ fic person , with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps world@@ view does not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er , &quot; the current editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps Int@@ oler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity , which I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr who fought for their lives in the environment and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; it still fits to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with much patience and suffering , and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise Council has helped me much in my career . &quot;
these people and those em@@ bodies through them em@@ bodies my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump turned his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or maybe even because of its cont@@ emp@@ t of non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the argument with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump , because they were either by his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a ro@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; the people , one of my friends , said exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ tful and imp@@ lies an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows the people that their wor@@ ries and fears about hec@@ tic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which most white are voted for tr@@ ump , because they want to restore control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with regard to those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . ) . : as much as &quot; re@@ jection of the white against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; word game from white in access to the white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as it was a great Van Jones , has exactly what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country is elected as his president , twice the son of an Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose story he says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise to and say : to Hell with vers@@ atility , freedom of religion and all the concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in the Americas after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; in all these I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; ro@@ ared the crowd .
&quot; do you have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans a place in your America ?
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if anyone , who is not like you , is a place in your America ? &quot;
he received an impressive and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t it your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was rec@@ ti@@ led . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Country , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people , who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks me my heart .

from mis@@ ery to the stars : these Latin American children do not leave their love to music by waste .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the Province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ic town Cat@@ e@@ ura together ?
&quot; that music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large gar@@ bage dump , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a few years now , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the municipality : one of the children and adult existing symph@@ ony orchestra , which has been found with their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome her poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students have become a central interest for the community of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the church , located in one of the poorest provinces Mexican , is known for her drugs abuse and the banana @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; however , this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project , and the youth had always offered a rare hopes . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI believes : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch , they run through the du@@ sty roads to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you are always laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the bust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village located practically on the largest gar@@ bage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recur@@ ring waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with restored instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura where the recycling of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez started making parts of the case in instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ pose viol@@ ins , viola , b@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tromb@@ ones and percussion that were all made from gar@@ bage . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez reminds himself of local ecology and music teacher of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , at the beginning time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , the kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
&quot; this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown somewhat , which he never saw before : one made of waste . &quot;
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and called the Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic gar@@ bage dump ) shows the musical performance :
the world generates approximately one billion tonnes of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him , and live with him , like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspiring spectac@@ le from tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these Eastern African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication happens in the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , this ship was known that this ship had already been in illegal fishing waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were disp@@ leased this over the accordingly , and slightly incl@@ ined , to be called an ar@@ ous@@ y of this kind in their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ment@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles mobi@@ lized rapidly against the ship . they refused to share one of their ports and refused to share a fishing law . &quot;
&quot; &quot; suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that all of you refused to do everything &quot; , &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not succeeded to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; finally , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisher@@ y ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are six countries driven by the Premier of their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , we have eight countries that are simultaneous and working together . they exchange information from and stand each other in where it goes illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden , absent because of it extremely difficult . thus , the illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; by the intenti@@ onal dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habit@@ ats and species are being protected , the illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems may have damage , which have a delicate equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um . &quot;
&quot; however , during action against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucr@@ atic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , the actions in real @-@ time , with tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can ex@@ changing the lists of existing licenses , news to susp@@ ect activities or details that you noticed during a harbour inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very carefully when moving these on the open sea by satellite data .
&quot; this enables the authorities to identify ships , which fish in banned areas . also , such as susp@@ icious road@@ ways can discover that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish licence where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing companies may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports , which means that ships could not sell their charge . and that they could not be forced to sell their charge , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owners , meaning that the illegal fishing is fin@@ anci@@ ally worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , leading director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a celebr@@ ity dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ ISH . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain a total of 20 million USD in lost turnover , which will lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that penet@@ rate in East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing plants for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these are also illegal fishermen .
&quot; other practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , counterfeit license papers , indication of Phant@@ as@@ en@@ ames , the fishing protected species and the fish in nature areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they take advantage of the lack of international co @-@ operation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ mosquito control system &quot; , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; it was a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could say &apos; You have not allowed my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and precisely this legal slip hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
the closed front works so far .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected Shi@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; there has been criminal networks uncovered , who had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . there were ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities and has found volatile ships and found it . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organis@@ ational crimes , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that should help F@@ ISH @-@ i , susp@@ icious ships more precise . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , helps maintain Il@@ legal Shi@@ ps to hide the illegal ships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; Duncan Cop@@ eland , Head analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tra@@ cking , an NGO who also deals with fish@@ eries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that connects different information network . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with larger precision . &quot;
a model program
&quot; but , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s Team African Nations can actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ? &quot;
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch together with Google and the Maritime organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each tra@@ ce@@ able ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; ent@@ un with the neighbours to get a better picture of it , who does it - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system uses persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are evidence that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel crimin@@ als , but they also deter them . &quot;
&quot; ships , which previously f@@ ished without a license and hardly have consequences to count , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries , since then fishing boats will buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia helped Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors took place on board Schle@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries have noticed these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are going to disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined together for the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH . &quot; &quot; with safety , the aim is to have more such initiatives and structures will also arise in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph in October : in October it was a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were not only forbidden . &quot;
&quot; the ship was even in forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the letter of dimensional rules against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; Ber@@ gh says . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence shows that such special , collabor@@ ative work for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela , the government of Venezuela rejected a referendum on a referendum on a referendum on the political and economic crisis of the country in whose eyes were the negotiations gathered for the political and economic crisis of the country by entering the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate will also be guided in other parts of the country - among other things , in the low@@ lands MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north federal state Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ part@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation in the country deteri@@ orated continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition were seen in the officers of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance to take a fundamental change ; however , the post@@ ure of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles in the context of the government statement as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation rate of inflation and health was estimated at 500 % ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % ) and in which a gra@@ zing and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was to rec@@ ap@@ preh@@ end its institutional structures and conclude its institutional structures . &quot;
&quot; the elections of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round Table of the Democratic Unit ) , who had joined the opposition to the support of the National Assembly , as well as a march to the support of the National Assembly , on October 3 , should continue to continue the block@@ ade of the refer@@ end@@ ums to the term . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday and on 3rd November all moved to Caracas to Mira@@ flo@@ res Palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the promotion programme &quot; The return of Venezuela &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches that are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disp@@ utes with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most frequently shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ators who calls through the protection signs : &quot; will you kill me because I have hunger ?

&quot; particularly large waves beat the message over pol@@ ite supp@@ ression into the central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay , the central town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , protest@@ ers return to the local cathedral , to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the State State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira do not wear coats , because you could see something else could not have many nation@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Inf@@ ographic already makes the turn that forms the extent of supp@@ ression per day : &quot;
so the dictatorship is supp@@ ressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counterpart in question - this has now been proven in the eyes of many , by the presence of countless people on the streets . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ d@@ ado claim that 1 % of signatures are fake .
here is your counterpart !
on the road !
&quot; other evalu@@ ates these protests as another step in the fight against a government , which made a little bit against the devastating economic crisis and rather concerned with critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the march will always take more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Vene@@ tians reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in CÃ³rdoba , CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , were examined crimes committed during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not been looking for his life .
&quot; starting in the brush , the same name as his father bear up to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept his family sec@@ rec@@ y for 34 years .
in the situation then I believed that was fine .
I felt like a secret mag@@ ent .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; then I was not able to know that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ cen@@ ary . during the Argentin@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was Deputy from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atro@@ cities in the course of the years that he had seen as a boy , and he told a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;

&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went into the sports hall . there I had been with a boy who made mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father from him and a few days later , he showed me a black @-@ white photo and called me to identify my friend . &quot;

&quot; therefore he charged me to go back into the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be obe@@ dience . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university closures , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , pro@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ at@@ erial , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da the prisoners are tortured .
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
during the first and last time he left me at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise up . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bit wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ums@@ y silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen objects were shut down and under@@ lined me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he indicated an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I went in , and saw a song where men were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
&quot; later , I found out that they attach it to an end of a cable . the other end was fixed at the body of the person who lay down there . &quot;
&quot; they caught a man with wr@@ inkl@@ es on the bed , over@@ shot it with water and pursued a charge of 220 Volt to the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the gest@@ ure there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell returned from his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I was clear that the smell of an body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much more suffering ?
&apos; I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father participated in the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were folded with wr@@ inkl@@ es and hal@@ ted eyel@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pe@@ z , a civilian , who also was indicted in the process ) and I took the opportunity to throw a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people with the face down@@ wards - all were folded at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the entran@@ ces , people were silent on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the cap@@ tives , he said , &quot; What do you look like , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; Why did you bring me back ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told her home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed one man .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of survivors , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who also was indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was also charged with Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , the director of La Per@@ la , leads through former tort@@ uring chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way , which you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apping came here . &quot;
&quot; look at the map , see that they took about this path and tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of un@@ human rights . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement of the top came up that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things with home .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war yield &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military , I was in G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie - I was clear that war@@ fare is an B@@ aj@@ on@@ ett or maybe military sign that one has fought for an enemy who has fought for an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then there is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
that is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never liked it to steal into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once again he called me a criminal , and I answered : and thou whom you walk in the street ? &quot;
you are no crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded wrath , struck me , and cried , saying , &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , then I will find you , and bring you self @-@ hanging . &quot;
we don &apos;t need any other !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ stretching from wool . both had my father out of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me to have been with this crime . I said , no problem , they can put me to load what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to tell . &quot;
&apos; the disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ ec@@ ary act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I am ashamed . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a lifetime . &quot;
one develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went to say so far :
&quot; well , you ex@@ iled during the dictatorship of the dictatorship . but what the bodies may disappear ? &quot;
why children do children lead ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could just be able to bring them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but what their bodies may disappear ? &quot;
&quot; did these people do not have families , to whom they could be handed over to their mort@@ al remains ? &quot;
&quot; the body &apos;s disappearance is the last ab@@ ec@@ ar act , which one can do a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was introduced again , they brought machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains of course .
I have seen how you have killed people ! &apos;
just to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I even was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought to show my father was created during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made his accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities I had to do for him .
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for the whole over@@ drive Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they allegedly defended , actually were good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
&quot; you committed a terrible crime , and you comp@@ elled me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; Well , let me show me . &quot;
exactly what did I do .
&quot; in 2010 , I made the first display . &quot;
I finally knew that he was a criminal .
nobody can tell me that I am vo@@ iced . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still standing before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indicted for 416 crimes : among them severe , unconditional freedom of freedom in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of de@@ duction of a under 10 @-@ year child . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the judgement .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended with crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 : for crimes against humanity was found guilty of crimes against humanity . the court imposed life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases pen@@ alties between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , we were acqu@@ itt@@ al . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgment : murder ; torture and rape by officers . # Es@@ war@@ heads ror@@ ism
&quot; all the def@@ endants were members of the military , former police officers , former police officers and civil employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
&quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations , who worked for victims for years for years . &quot;
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentin@@ ean organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people who were murdered during the dictatorship or disappeared , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but the research for it took 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argentin@@ ean government delivered the country to La Per@@ la , so that there was a memorial to be established there , which is now managed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto where you can extend his driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
machining of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word of the board of the &quot; &quot; elderly drivers &quot; &quot; means that the &quot; older drivers &quot; means , &quot; but maybe even with ar@@ ched back@@ grounds &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1 to 20 September , the wrong translation was on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; editing the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided into social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was to interpre@@ t Julian Holmes , a population of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the conservative daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n wrote in the Kyoto Protocol :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that nobody has read the translation .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and in an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the appropriate , although gramm@@ atically not quite the correct name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ fecture was responsible for translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by trans@@ lators , and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; we really sorry that older people felt by in@@ adequate correction ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News sat up with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as an appropriate description of elderly drivers . according to the police , the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by senior citizens . this represents a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of seniors caused accidents in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ ing @-@ known rep@@ orters brought to the release of the article of the article about the light , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese apparently against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo over the translation errors received the following comments :
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) about the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So defective is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that this is a real translation error .
there are no such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is widespread in Asia as well
translation errors are widespread in Japan and all Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for this bizarre mistake in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of transmission ratios are varied .
&quot; for example , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is in the case of breast language . generally , the conviction that trans@@ lators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - parent language should be . &quot;
a French native language should translate into English for example from English into French - not from the French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother tongue , which could produce translations into English . this may be a lack of understanding for the over@@ set , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that Japanese will be attributed to Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies who have no foreign employees , do not allow translations to grow internally . then , the Japanese employees , whose English knowledge is the best to be considered , no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ene and r@@ attle phr@@ ases that are created by machine translation , show that this technique can not replace a long human trans@@ lators for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulation in Japan , among them also the r@@ attle prints that are often used T @-@ shirts or pockets , are not used to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless . but by big companies or from the government , which have funds to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a more serious source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and interest rates on the Internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ al con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y S@@ oc@@ ie@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an internet use that they would not have access to more than online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet list of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV also wrote no more accessible . &quot;
&quot; also other online channels carried out the protests in Caracas , which were organized by op@@ ener groups , which the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author of Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is curved , and recommended the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages Venezuel@@ an provider are again locked again .
this is from the site of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offerings such as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media has hes@@ itated on protests since 2014 . then , the Commission approved them with money pen@@ alties and closure , when they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission continued this as &quot; appeal to violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national television channels , I have signed up @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net . &quot;
amazing that the remains cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is un@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two more online transmitter . this also concerns the website , on which the National Assembly transfers their meetings . &quot;
&quot; previous findings of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers can sometimes use DNA . this is a technique to answer the DNS servers of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers or ref@@ uses the request to such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sperm : @ el@@ op oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the broadcast on Thursday , April 6th , was hired as the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res which took over the protests in Caracas . &quot;
&quot; Flo@@ res was beaten , while he was found in police custody . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on show again . &quot;
&quot; even though some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connection : thus the Ven@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ians will continue to continue access to multi @-@ media coverage of the current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls will become a slave to get a training &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today Tina fought for the rights of children and colle@@ cts witness of other Cri@@ ad@@ itas , which were exactly as they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a report by curator , published by Global Vo@@ ices , courtesy of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ ailing cows , down@@ fall schools &quot; ) , edited by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where they were not together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her graduation in the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house filled with pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; that , out of which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . Cri@@ ad@@ itas den@@ otes the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is very simple : a great family with little money over@@ s its under@@ age @-@ old son or her under@@ age daughter to another , abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children can afford to do inn@@ um@@ erable days of home@@ work that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that can &apos;t lift up in the context of an Treaty that you can &apos;t raise . &quot;
&quot; as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , practice is widespread in Paraguay due to participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous problems of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after graduation , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she said with Cri@@ ad@@ itas , especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected stuff , calculated and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things in the name , because the feeling of grat@@ itude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ ad@@ itas , guarantees in general ce@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who put their daughter in faith , that she can improve their training to improve their position in society and can do something from themselves &quot; to a different family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , which takes up the girl with itself and its exploitation by faith justi@@ fies that they would not get a chance that would otherwise be no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the sacrifice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will only find many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , had a vision . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº in the hospital , her body showed traces of stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in the household of former military officers Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an officer at the registered office .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in their home in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small place with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira struck as long as long as with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered a fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
she insi@@ sted that the murdered child was Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen Society of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they recorded the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest in protest and demanded that there was no further Carolina &apos; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to hurt the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the married and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a breeding investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case comes before court , the fall of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be present , if the first time in history is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go before court . &quot;
everyday life of a Cri@@ ad@@ ita
the Cri@@ ad@@ itas are not only exploited as labour force and also isolated from other girls in her old age .
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , bank@@ rupt and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work all , and began to sell on the road or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ ad@@ ita into the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
&quot; so , they had to share the time so that you still stayed time for learning . &quot;
it stood every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , it cle@@ ated the fridge , p@@ umped the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected soil . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more time it was finished with learning , the more leisure time she had . &quot;
but this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employer .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , it never had to be hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the master &apos;s house as food from the fridge . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the master &apos;s house , a military military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was to power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings forced the house@@ keeper Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and Editorial made from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero , &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to give the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but kept not with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who heard that he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family , because it was the opinion that I had heard there again &quot; bad habits &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ , at home again their mother tongue Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ would speak . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had made to lose again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; however , it was completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid for them with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated in school . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is M@@ ob@@ bing and the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , to whom Cri@@ ad@@ itas are exposed to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anybody to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time where friend@@ ships arise , I felt very clearly that I was one group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company cheap the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share opportunities for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay . &quot;

legislative bill writes Egyptian users social media to register in the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 . &quot;
sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently submitted a bill to &quot; Reg@@ ulations concerning the instructions and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when he is adopted by Parliament , users and users will need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up , which is instructed to share citizens and citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , user experience and users would have to register with their right name and identity numbers , to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be failed to do this , then it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or pur@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video files and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear how the law is passed when it is accepted , as the draft may not be imposed on how Egyptian authorities can not register the user inside and users of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register in the situation that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a user name and password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall to get the Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a fire@@ wall on national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians need to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans exist .
experts and experts are scep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the court .
&quot; Ram@@ y R@@ ao@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; Manager of Personal Rights &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I have double the technical capacities , and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have done with technology . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that the same as they could have non@@ violent public and private spaces that could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take it seriously , then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people , and to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically no real realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed under the Legisl@@ ative Assembly and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and acceptance will be successful or not , the design &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , whose senses is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the picture surface , &quot; says R@@ ao@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , T@@ amer El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a lifetime sentence was planned for those who had been guilty to thre@@ aten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the veter@@ inary owner H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza , and her team of scientists of non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq have to protect the spiritu@@ ally Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; the Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are at risk because of the habitat , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and because they are getting less lo@@ ot . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video , the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; &quot; and the health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a large pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leopard in fact is low and goes against zero . as the team is fixed in the video , it is a recording of a big cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as trained Biolog@@ in shows R@@ aza passionate about another side of their country , which exists not only from war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved since six years of field studies on wild animals and educational programmes of Nature Iraq .
&quot; since 2013 , it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is set up for making protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , documented in the Nor@@ theast Japan &apos;s liberal daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fukushima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a et@@ ous pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring regions of Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate have been evacu@@ ated ; because the tsun@@ ami had van@@ ished all the coastal towns of the map .
&quot; furthermore , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o report shows the adv@@ ances six years after the adv@@ ances in order to rebuild the life of local authorities .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building agency as well as the survey results of the affected itself .
&quot; buildings in Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts ( for the house of the house , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fukushima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to list the largest success among the three pre@@ pre@@ fec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has finished 75 percent of such houses , while the Fukushima share the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; in fact , six years after the disaster , evacu@@ ated by the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated by Beh@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) moved to final spare buildings . &quot;
&quot; after three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in the accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36 000 people still lived from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fukushima and I@@ w@@ ate in such conditions . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fukushima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated workers were hau@@ led after the disaster in the accommodation . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is at 34 percent . &quot;
the stand of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; like the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , who were affected by the mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ings are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing ports have been re@@ produced in Fukushima . &quot;
the tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident have gone out in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ lands in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the ar@@ able land in Fukushima can be used again . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is , because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares are destroyed in the fields of Fukushima , lying in the nuclear state of nuclear zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ings , the tourism has recovered far again , but again Fukushima left the Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 per cent on the same level as before the mis@@ fortune . Fukushima , however , can be only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to earn their living conditions . &quot;
is the indigenous population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total picture , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and among the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the status of reconstruction and also , as you can find emp@@ ties over the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a questionnaire to bring more about the tsun@@ ami @-@ consciousness under the native population in experience .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the local population , have taken measures to be prepared in order to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 per cent of respondents found that still not enough for cat@@ astrop@@ hes have been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had been evacu@@ ated from the Fukushima pre@@ fecture
&quot; in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has intensi@@ fied its attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fukushima . &quot;
&quot; Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthqu@@ akes and the devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fukushima pre@@ fecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic accident , nuclear power , had to join the Japan . &quot;
&quot; out of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fukushima , nearly 63 000 people were placed in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23 000 people were transferred back to Fukushima , in permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their homeland pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astrop@@ hes , most of the evacu@@ ated workers are still missing in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ hausen , older than 50 years old . they are able to re@@ juven@@ ate the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fukushima with massive construction projects . this is the building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when you meet people from other countries that speak another language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , you often realize that one more links than it seems to look at the first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important because they demand our pre@@ judi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world finally is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices of Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s see exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often earn less attention than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment , in which they have felt very strongly associated with someone over language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Veron@@ ese Kri@@ kon@@ i says about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music worked in London ; Viol@@ eta Cam@@ ar@@ asa remembers the time where they worked with people from all over the world , and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experience , which he collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into intensive care station : last Friday he had defeated a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide millions of protest@@ ers took part in protest against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ trau@@ ma and several fra@@ c@@ tures . &quot;
doctors performed him this Saturday and now put it into an artificial coma .
its condition is regarded as critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which rapidly spread within a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures , the vision of the police officer can be seen , which was attacked with a striking stock . the man was identified as Augusto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police arrested in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the completion of the investigation in the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers such as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; would be a police officer of a protest@@ ers and landing on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and that the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of the media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which you see how Mat@@ eus attacked by police officers and tell him several sanitary briefly . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective is filmed , is also immer@@ sed in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the clip , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus down on the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian territory ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to keep part of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s &apos;s memory : &quot;
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experiences a wave of political violence : here the activist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish of his father was murdered only because he was attacked the Occup@@ y Movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva that has been attacked by a police force that has been attacked by a police force that has been attacked by a police force .
police sur@@ passes
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil on Friday to brutal police operations against protest@@ ers last Friday .
&quot; police officers set up a stage for Red@@ ner in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) , asked the police via loud@@ speaker to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media road prot@@ ested the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted via a broken glass window to illustr@@ ate her cover pages .
&quot; by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a fire on a fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no pl@@ au@@ sible journ@@ alistic foundation , more about a broken window disk than the protests of thousands who serve the defense of a special thing to report . &quot;
this must also recognize if you are strict against any form of atomic damage .
&quot; even here , the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd effect , and the typical violence of the military police are carried out by headlines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on Con@@ front@@ ational course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the villages of the forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar factories included in the doors of Cuba ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) . &quot;
&quot; the Volks@@ gregation Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is widely known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of what there is no notable sugar harvest spot . &quot;
it is two years ago when activities in the sugar tube factories were laid .
&quot; the sugar industry in the region stood still , and the factory lost after and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 272 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some changes the job .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to factories , which are still ma@@ stered . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ di@@ veter@@ an , who stand up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar @-@ ro@@ lean industry do not smoke his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are in the east of the region of sugar , which are once more active in operation , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he was not expected .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , I would receive the sugar ro@@ cker factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry is already the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ suffici@@ ency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar raw industry was an economic necessity : 155 sugar raw materials were technically out@@ dated and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country .
&quot; initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they only left the factories left to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves , which led to such measures , were the small productivity of the sugar ro@@ lean plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar prize rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report published by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and nutrition organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not all ran well
&quot; today &apos;s day , the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro took place during his speech on 21 October 2002 in Lav@@ ander@@ o &apos;s sugar factory . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total of 98 sugar production factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
&quot; the same thing happened in the Gregori@@ ro@@ hr@@ fabrik Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , says about the closure of the factory , the word that he is repeated most , &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respondents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order to get the place , it was a full time - working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of this year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would be removed only regarding the parts that would be removed , the address and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ f Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could conv@@ ey every escape . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility of responsibility and letters were increasingly being more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money in operation . &quot; he assured .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , waiting for the retirement in another complex , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stand@@ still of the factory , whose construction was helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he assembled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producers was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to work and services that were generated in the communities in which they were created . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the mamm@@ oth &apos;s speech in the eyes of 21 October 2002 , then President in the eyes of the present people saw that he had no longer run for the areas whose factories would have been doing well for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of the sugar tube factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by toll . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Community of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things are changing , but not always to better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar ro@@ wer factory was closed , or better , when they started to stop it , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ted this also other establishments . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not serve once for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant remains impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; in Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty , the old soldiers bring a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is no down@@ tra@@ geous person , yet he gives the lies that one told him . &quot;
she has tor@@ ment it for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pension , not because it is lacking in force , but because he is bit@@ ing . &quot;

you@@ ths of the First Nations communities in all Canada deal with topics that are important for them . they are doing with Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of walking workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an tour , mobile audio studios have been offering directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to accommodate youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live production . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and lived in Montreal with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The North@@ star . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will ensure that the young people take part in our conversations as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever it comes to sense . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia , and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway from tears , &quot; on which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women were missing or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not explained .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ es@@ Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video player to mediate , how important of receiving traditional customs and customs , despite influences through glob@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters have not always prevail in language of the First Nations languages . &quot;
&quot; in the following song we recorded the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First nation , the refra@@ in is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people took some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the North@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop group , who gave them a st@@ illness in the dial@@ ect eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ ebook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the st@@ rop@@ es is available , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel when nobody would be interested in me ?
but I &apos;m trying to go on earth my days
that is the day that you will take our cry
because we have lost our way to life in life
&quot; but I believe that we will rise to one day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and continue our youth as well . &quot;
&quot; so , they can do that for what it is determined by the Creator &quot;

in Japan you can see almost every restaurant plastic dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers , what exactly is located on the menu , will be displayed near the area of sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( with the &quot; &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; &quot; ) of any dish which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see this plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of this plastic dishes .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ oter district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there is a variety of these small companies , which also produce those plastic dishes that documented the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so usual that they do not even stri@@ ve to them again . a new trend , however , turns them today in show@@ casing mobile accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Nav@@ er Mat@@ oms , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decor@@ ated cell@@ ulose tapes such as them in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artists were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ ly collection objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets were : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly elabor@@ ate .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel dish with seafood ) is turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ ang@@ ular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile support .
also this part we have manufactured in Tokyo for the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple which contains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing attraction .
&quot; some mobile support and mobile designer allow your own work of work . in this case , ik@@ ura and Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated is used , a popular p@@ opping , served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had doubts :
&quot; there is someone who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can betra@@ y my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also accept a less appe@@ ti@@ able form , to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant to surprise . &quot;
our latest mobile support has the shape of mel@@ mel@@ on ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; further paths r@@ ile plastic dishes can be seen under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Nav@@ er Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # 2 , with the D@@ ash@@ tag # 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , then this video gives you an insight into the district K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the restaurant industry . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against this organised crime
&quot; for the victims of fighting against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking &quot; in Mexico , they regularly appear in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that brings this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ ells , the stories of the victims of the conflict was perfect in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , anyone looking at the dream or to the communities that have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone was in the hundreds of secret graves , stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug traff@@ icking &quot; ) into life , that the victims should give a voice and tell stories of people who were fighting in the struggle between the prosecution and cart@@ on . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organis@@ ational crimes does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and whole communities have to travel many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( german : &quot; how fear@@ ful lives &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for every weekend secret graves after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father and two sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; how every Sunday we prepare ourselves again to the task that we have made us , go and go to graves , according to the people who we loved , looking for . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who also is with me here . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you do not have the insurance of my father , but it doesn &apos;t get paid out because they demand a mortality certificate . &quot;
where should we get it ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are afraid . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state of state . &quot;
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution is remin@@ ded of us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form they occurs : &quot;
illness and Sens@@ ation journ@@ alism have I seen since some years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ken every day and see the cover pages with pictures , which actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or files of specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling , as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I can &apos;t be equally valid or consider this as normal .
she writes further :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin thinks that he is great . and it is not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , this is what would they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear , that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to blo@@ t numbers in a statistic will be revealed .
&quot; the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighbor , so that they were up . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk to themselves , that they remain un@@ punished by such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months Er@@ press@@ ance in the main city district , &quot; like a family with threats of threats from their business , until they did not only destroy the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you lost and remember how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains high , the fear is coming up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; we are further away from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want to be arrested for others , because you don &apos;t know when they will kill or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these fear@@ ful days , if I would like to dissolve my profound feelings , but the answer is no ; for I have forgotten how to weep . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez , &quot; a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of her . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook , potatoes crum@@ ble , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that dwell with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; however , they are in@@ significant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , one told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ends .
&quot; his childhood was already past two years ago , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , the bloody suffering of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , as a violence by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the State Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average 8.5 murders per day . &quot;
these are just a few of thousands of thousands who organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul &apos;s soul .
&quot; only a few stories live in view of the headlines , but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data in 2015 , whose aim is to provide complex information behind the failed fight against drug traff@@ icking in the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this post and the pages , to which he ver@@ ted , include pictures , on which power is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fac@@ simile check is important in a moment , in which it is about to raise a rum@@ our or a fake . &quot;
&quot; but what is the years after the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tend to continue . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies that took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this wrong cop@@ ing of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - deny the fact that there are abundant coverage about events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it thro@@ ws questions about our desire to pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank cars crossed the place San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country was negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , the tan@@ kers fell victim to the victims . &quot;
&quot; chief representatives described a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses included , including a cinemas in the vicinity , which was full of people who illustr@@ ate the football world@@ master@@ y . &quot;
houses mis@@ chief and heavy cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the grey scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of bol@@ ted body that are excited on the ground while they look at .
but here the story does not find their end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was released several times on social media , blogs , and other platforms , but certainly not to be attributed to the related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , the B@@ oko Har@@ am fighters in Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on took on 3 January 2015 . &quot;
eye testify reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and car@@ nival were burned in streets and prayer .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained back to count bodies , &quot; said a inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up period could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army of army in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt to win the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ using use of the picture from the DR Congo is only one in a series of failure ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was taken as a cover for mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; another step further bring personal comments , such as this example , the picture from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to deliver arguments . &quot;
the painting from San@@ ge joined the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a Flash message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee battles , rape and some dead , some of them . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , po@@ d@@ les reported like the following that these descriptions were gathered with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this image comes from an aci@@ dic Arabian news page , which was wr@@ ong@@ ated in 2012 , the President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an being said that monks and politicians had taken part in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from the DR Congo to bil@@ let this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was published on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , the AFP as their source mentioned , had also rejected Th@@ an His testimony , but did not allow the picture from the DR Congo in connection . &quot;
the global range of false data
&quot; traces of these false cou@@ ps are rich in 2011 and 2012 , and actually coming from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; using a &quot; inver@@ ted picture search &quot; you can see how far more information can be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; the search of the search engine with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 344 images under 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the picture of the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing mas@@ ch private pages , platforms social media and common publications and national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , but have tried other attempts to clari@@ fy the for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; we have taken examples of mis@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which side they have been published . therefore , we want to represent the range more clearly than by the language . &quot;
several examples from the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other ) can be used several examples of mis@@ used use .
&quot; here are some cases , which can now be fully re@@ plac@@ eable ( on the card in orange ) : &quot;
map : News Fr@@ ames .
country examples of wrong copy of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ in countries refer to pages or server , the examples of fake or fal@@ cons are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in grey are examples that are available according to the met@@ ad@@ ata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also counterfeit example . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( in an online discussion forum ) as part of a Th@@ reads to the war of the Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; this post , which raised itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the picture of the DR Congo will NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ an being claimed to have been involved in 2012 , that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims , and brought the story with the image from San@@ ge . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time this release is still included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the Catholic site of An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , explicitly stated that the picture was not written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it &apos;s a &quot; similar d@@ ship attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in circulation , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to contradi@@ ct that there would be connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the picture of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion under Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the connections to Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that , in the name of the Islam@@ s , they wanted to achieve greater attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image has been killed as a cover for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were linked to it were taken in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to set attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( written ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that had been written by a &quot; &quot; Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; by the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre was in circulation , discussion forums like this here on Vietnamese and declared it to the detection . &quot;
&quot; from the message , which included the picture from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clark mission@@ aries mission@@ aries and Fr Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) shows Tin@@ Eye also , but are no longer fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the Web@@ cra@@ wler and have a unified file in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image is ultimately a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong topics or frames ( objec@@ tions ) that pass through this posts . the first frame focuses on Religion .
the photo was used in terms of larger discussions about the silence in connection with the victims of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of the Muslims - the victims of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second Fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how images in connection with these efforts are used . &quot;
&quot; however , a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can &apos;t give this pictures longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are many people who have un@@ intended to have the share of drinking water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ars this mood of false and counterfeit information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and decor@@ ates the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of for@@ cible images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that it comes back from pictures of a ref@@ us@@ al to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even required by victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern that non@@ violent pictures reader and viewers des@@ en@@ si@@ bil@@ ise and their ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , seeking to work as violent media on it ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot regarding non@@ violent represent@@ ations in the news media , fact is fact that they are indispensable to today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News . &quot; you will need to think about situation in which a picture can be noted , but it can also be solved in context or completely mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false assign@@ ments should also consider how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Simmons is used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( for d@@ t. un@@ mistak@@ able ) is trying to offer a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate .
there are words in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ mistak@@ able words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply ro@@ oted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ s@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist by &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Do you get your parents in recognition of your parents , how to make yourself in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth , you feel after having grown to cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Burma &apos;s own words about :
&quot; they grin@@ der other cultures , reveal other ideas and raise our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , as we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site would like to publish more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka currently looks at the worst high water and carriage disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ sun , who usually sets the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the shore . &quot;
&quot; after a statement from Sri Lanka &apos;s report from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missed because of the floods and sli@@ pping win@@ ches . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since the last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100 000 people were brought to 304 safe residence .
&quot; the rain was gradually returned on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water states in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene requirements of the population constitute a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos have an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water distances of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka twe@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ ial crisis , save the Children , after further regeneration are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also over@@ flooded with the crossing of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five planes for ambul@@ ance actions and further five are made for transport of emergency deliveries in their flooded villages .
various organisations and start@@ ups have also been preparing to help .
Facebook pages like help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about high water supply and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams dr@@ ones need for their operations , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
&quot; for all , who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for high @-@ water victims - &quot;
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this field .
&quot; the Tax@@ es @-@ App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ Center is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Trophy Ro@@ an@@ u , Pic@@ Me introduced a &quot; High Water Aid &quot; button to call it allowed to call a vehicle for pickup from help and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the sr@@ il@@ ank@@ ic Red Cross . &quot;
they also led a &quot; SOS button &quot; that had more than a thousand en@@ quiries and 150 successful boat inter@@ actions for floods and land@@ slides were included .
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kas , where several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring residents in need in need of security and afford help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , and they trusted in me their children : she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in one minute we call par@@ ol@@ es for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; in the next , we are entitled to rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ scarf high , bound from an American flag , other channels par@@ ole against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not affect you , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not a Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these entertainment .
&quot; people , with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the common concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; which has built themselves in their idea . &quot;
they were mus@@ sels me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t see all the same .
we pract@@ ise our religion differently .
&quot; we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , on different art . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is well constructed in our collective idea that as soon as Muslims , which will not fit to clean there . &quot;
de@@ mus@@ li@@ fied are being mi@@ li@@ fied
I don &apos;t stand alone .
that &apos;s even the poet that poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images are coming in a sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was so old , as I &apos;m now , he was an orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of Muslims in the reduced images of Muslims who had colonial books for centuries .
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man who should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
Edward Said the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward Said the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures are even added today .
our politicians who continue the news industry and Hollywood .
I have been working for thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful and faul@@ t@@ ative nar@@ r@@ ative have dominated our news@@ feeds .
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ ves overs@@ ha@@ do@@ ves the reality that have led them in the last three decades of nine Muslim women , while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this nar@@ rati@@ vely fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women may carry on it , their head@@ scarf in public buildings have forced to cover their entire body to cover their entire body , which are both two sides of the same medal . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group pract@@ ises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
this severe nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements to change .
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on the American soil of Afri@@ kan@@ ers , which had been associated with slaves . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective pre@@ dic@@ ation , deeply and faul@@ t@@ ingly , that often S@@ ik@@ h @-@ men and children become an objective of anti @-@ inflammatory attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; due to these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories that are based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ r@@ ative who help us to understand the world .
and my industry failed to record the nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the highest degree &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation that come from 77 countries .

&quot; at that time , when Khan was re@@ thinking the Sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unable to kill Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but I &apos;m not a Muslim and American woman now ?
&quot; sometimes , if people wonder why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or give my hand to my hand that all Muslims carry out - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ pa . &quot;

we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who make an effort to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current band of a well @-@ ador@@ ned Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with money , think tanks and experts for fal@@ tering , which is a Muslim ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; due to the stories that we tell and because of the way , in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger which breaks the head@@ scarf . &quot;

I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but a Muslim was born until I was four years old , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behaviour and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the fire that I am Muslim when they could see the Muslim of the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the sole rit@@ ual with my daughter , when I hold them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the protection , which are called the Koran and the Q@@ add@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; every one of them , I repeat three times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I pray that they are protected from evil , the evil one that you can see and evil which you can &apos;t see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; it is the picture of you that I may see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their fully finished and un@@ finished painting with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters you can close . &quot;
&quot; Muslim means to be to talk the prayers that they had said to me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; for the Muslim is to be in it , as it taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; it was a deep meaning for a people who founded - through a &quot; Empire &quot; by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; it has a profound meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men are not crying , but at the same time , that my own grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the inside , while reading books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan wept for his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he did not include in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , their families , as in my grandfather , by colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; for instance , Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have been living all up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was thrown over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ asch@@ al sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; from the newspapers of his time , as he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before it was airplanes , he travelled into more parts of the world when I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of 1,7 billion , we go back into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ locked history . &quot;
&quot; it means that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops , spread over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , in which Iraq went to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means to know that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of war .
an American Muslim means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ nings under veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy is home to the USA , and susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times more reported than a history with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liberated black slaves . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was vers@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X call a American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people filled the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand for our dreams , and if we say black lives . &quot;
&quot; an American woman to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fying the in@@ firm@@ ity inter@@ se@@ ction@@ ality of our with multiple bin@@ ds of acci@@ dental ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of the 1.7 billion hi@@ des more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; against &quot; her . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch of structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia er@@ ect . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists of the Muslim Regist@@ ered creatures which began with President Bush and had been extended to President Obama .
it consists in perme@@ able monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it exists in the immigration officer , which takes an five @-@ year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders across from the countries , which are bom@@ bed . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; which takes largely Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; these are the wars that we lead and the bombs , which we t@@ oss on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those who we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed scientifically un@@ true image and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the least score .
the conversation we must lead
&quot; we are too deep , to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; other &quot; . &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades , the roots of our fears to recognize and the faul@@ t@@ less and dangerous expression , which we refer to our news editors . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our multiple with bin@@ der ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the po@@ d@@ cast Sea Some@@ thing , Say Some@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the po@@ d@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ ale Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret Li@@ ves , an initiative of printing Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pakistan , Muslim , American Super@@ hel@@ din - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned about this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for that , swe@@ ating theore@@ ti@@ cian that existing in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they are exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown because they did Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally , by taking the &quot; other &quot; created . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not been given them ; now they reign over major territories in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the real@@ ities and the story , which I was not aware when I was so old , as it is now my daughter , but who made me today to an un@@ inhabited Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread cr@@ ite track in my speech .

&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ comfortable questions after the role of his , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; that we have no president in which we have no president , in which we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;

initiative for nar@@ r@@ ative art wants to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; tell the story of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
&quot; can there be a possibility , here and now , despite a language barrier with someone else ? &quot;
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) is the creation of stories in its original language a possible response . &quot;
&quot; Global Vo@@ ices reported about a short initiative by Steven Bird , the un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not based on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve the language variety of great cities . &quot;
&quot; indeed , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been conducted in the United States , where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 , the risk that small and not so little languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the world may be avoided if we accept cities , accept@@ ing di@@ vers@@ ities - safe spaces , in which residents do not have to be forgotten . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often to be connected to understand &quot; purposes these events instead &quot; , &quot; the listening to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers make their story first in their own language and transl@@ ating or explain in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation is that the listeners are on it . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou will also hold the opportunity to explain the country &apos;s typical customs of prayer . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the b@@ abel from the rab@@ bit and the p@@ avi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after having declared the meaning of his F@@ abel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in@@ sen he divi@@ des his sense of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
you have heard this !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and the organizers hope to expand this . all that are inspired by the project , can organise T@@ LS in contact to organize their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian Palestinian developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remin@@ ded the contributions that he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference on digital culture that will be al@@ igned in Berlin , dedicated a event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ n@@ ay , a scientist who produced in France ans@@ wer@@ able CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director at Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ struction ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was released last year and is licensed free here , contains a number of essays that deal with free culture in the presence of oppression . &quot;
it &apos;s a tribute to Bas@@ sel and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it means : &quot;
&quot; this book wants to discuss how moves to free knowledge and what the real cost are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , designers , researcher , researchers and authors who have involved in the movements for free knowledge have the page to look over the fog , who gives our news@@ feeds to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was painted out of the A@@ dra pris@@ ings in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or the residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title collective , gives his friends and his family a voice who want to push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will begin to think about their own fate , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
&quot; what have we abandoned in this process of time , extreme belie@@ fs ? &quot;
the web developer of Open Source and Digital activist has been in Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; given command of the Military Court of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government and put them in knowledge of an alleged death toll against her husband . &quot;
his place and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons involved in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a decisive role in it to expand access to the internet and knowledge of the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and presently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps there was none of Bass@@ els cultural prototypes expected as the work that he started working with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the way@@ side of numerous civilians and mer@@ ging the Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with hi@@ es@@ ky traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; then , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would like to put everything about it , this architecture that is not only em@@ bodied the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip in the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time cap@@ tive , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not yet close this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi contributed to the book , and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel brought me English when he was already in custody .
&quot; I learned to read and speak English well , to write and speak . &quot;
&quot; he always has his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he taught others , to read and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other customs , as they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without that they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a pro@@ filing , which she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; they sang the lyrics to him , when they visited him , he translated them out of the Arab into English . &quot;
the book is licensed free .

the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens with every visit , &quot;
&quot; I sin@@ ke in the world of your ench@@ anting eyes , &quot;
&quot; in the moment I lose the owner , in which we embrace us , &quot;
&quot; each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the pris@@ ons
&quot; and I came into every detail of your voice , and words &quot;
&quot; I bear with passion for me , &quot;
when your eyes say void
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness , &quot;
&quot; to recover all the moments , &quot;
and over your absence to weep and smile .
I bear witness myself that I will return soon ...

bass history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , over 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared since the beginning of the protests in 2011 . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or killed by the regime by the regime , tortured or even executed . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , according to international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in custody . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption in detention at the previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption of corruption , where a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus at which the corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment by Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment with four other def@@ endants in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; money from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose council Cam@@ b@@ aza , from 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested his setting to the company , which happened on April 19 , then . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Pro@@ secution of the Republic , that there would be no obst@@ acle basis for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to refer to his old post , as the company was not executed in detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants does not make the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision to put the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption , and clear the lack of transparency and is even a set@@ step towards the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we have to know is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ating process against the contra@@ diction .
&quot; the company was silent , however , and caused no appropriate legal steps to use the appropriate functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; conflic@@ ting &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a sentence , and half of them had eaten . &quot;
he could be paid talks and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es . he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has imag@@ ined to be integrated into the company which he helped damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will be paid for his silence .
resi@@ stible !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young mos@@ aic and student of political science in Brazil says the director of any mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the state , because he did not believe him , I won &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded someone in such a way that the state has been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza is missing the mor@@ als to serve and serve the state , * he had already been a unique opportunity to serve the state , but only has served on the state only . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state as handy to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the state itself has become tired , the pre @-@ charged and finally was sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a thief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison in Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , not only to remain as the first independent president in remembrance , but also as a sharp , cutting and - by way - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious person is capable of all , even the fath@@ er@@ land for its amb@@ itions , to sell its own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but it doesn &apos;t change from its amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also dis@@ able :
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was sitting in prison for 10 years . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to in@@ justice
the Bur@@ m@@ ical word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means K@@ ich@@ er@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age b@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ p@@ orted &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known soci@@ etal network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ jective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or the &quot; &quot; Cal@@ ar &quot; &quot; ( in bur@@ ial writing ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given an extremely ab@@ norm@@ ative con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cen@@ sored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may usually be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word in itself calls not automatically hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that , in which they discussed the use of the word or doubts about the use of the word , have been cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with basic different mean@@ ings , which have the same book@@ keeping as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; which contains the same letter as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( Sp@@ age b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ ebook@@ user A@@ ung Ka@@ ung explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends on spiritual kind , whether they knew how he could use his back pain when he made a vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; in win H@@ in Win H@@ ail is the opinion that it becomes a radical nation@@ alist , but also emphas@@ ized that Facebook analy@@ zer had to be able to spread Facebook before all the posts to spread rac@@ ism in the sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; manually . &quot;
it automatically filters the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you write on Fac@@ be@@ ook .
&quot; instead , what to do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by using the next words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( Sp@@ age b@@ sen ) .
&quot; the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists who hate speech , will receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it &apos;s time to circumc@@ ise its nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the promotion may send a strong signal to everyone who hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the c@@ ens@@ orship of percussion often have a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby users to use social networks simply to use a new word or alternative writing of the cen@@ sored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung described how Facebook began to extingu@@ ish his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and told me the li@@ ken , post and parts of content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community Standards &quot; was un@@ answered . &quot;
Facebook has a multitude of people removed from people who have no negative int@@ entions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech by Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author divided his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should do more about the beginning of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community will ask counsel : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a well @-@ willing intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
there will only be more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if it began to have this without local context or technical support and have banned as words such as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; Erb@@ cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they did not have mistakes , they tried not to rec@@ ise the dis@@ sol@@ dered posts . &quot;
&quot; if they have only a little bit of respect for the 15 million benefits , which gave them a great turnover , would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has ensured for a lot of spo@@ iling among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now on Facebook funny and write to the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of Hass@@ pron@@ unci@@ ation to see if their posts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts who have no speech language , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ mes@@ ic text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch the pe@@ aked cur@@ ry and a Indian film .
&quot; just to try , whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says , &quot; If you are a doctor , heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screenshot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alistic ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks have risen to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should also heat violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed for his failure , the bal@@ ancing hate speech on his bur@@ ial sides under control , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it could have been better running in context than in context than in code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is conclusion with the children before
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to offer a law that is supposed to offer this practice , so that the married age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change in adul@@ tery , some members of the Muslim and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the various religious groups ( IR@@ O ) , a group that representatives of various religious groups said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the state that the state should not inter@@ fere with maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened to the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN &apos;s legal convention , the min@@ ors of min@@ ors , under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country of the country confirmed that of 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married at 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ itions and social media movements , seeking to prevent laws on children before , followed by the foot and rejo@@ iced in great support . undoubtedly , they helped to carry out this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; an Hin@@ du Leader , for example , had no concerns to say the critics of the children before , they should be condemned to worry about their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was used for ten@@ sions in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and some doub@@ ted doubts , whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against children before decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent that contained in the House of Represent@@ atives , so that he would make a simple majority to make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now , only the president of the country must agree and declare the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a status update , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of law against children before the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes against it , and none of them decided . &quot;
&quot; after having decided in the Senate , the draft may now be the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was thr@@ illed because the laws of children were finally changed before .
&quot; Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial conference in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary Ger@@ ede , which has failed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost every price worth it . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson &apos;s opinion , it was definitely long enough to create practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was over@@ happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excell@@ ent News ! &quot;
the sp@@ inning network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who hears the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society , which openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the age of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the change of the marriage was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members , who were against , have agreed for the law . &quot;
the children before is not allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # so mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ hi@@ ra .
many thanks to all activists who have cast him out .
congratulations . congratulations .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to make judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supporters of the law , said it may be quite legitim@@ ate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to proceed to the law , most social media users would have wished to move the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell struck :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of talking about the discussion so generally , if we invite you to talk about the problem , our daughters suggest that they may have been ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ mates men who are against them in the advantage , would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe it is not a problem yet ?
&quot; but if it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where children are legal or still the norm , although there is laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday morning , the office of the local news service Yar@@ News announced that they were min@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; through the mirrors of websites , Turkish users can watch Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA , international ev@@ ap@@ orated . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; since more than one month , Turkey has now closed the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day for day is clear@@ er , how important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and journalists and fans of TV series defend themselves against the sperm .
&quot; although many techniques experienced Internet users are used to use re@@ plac@@ ements tools for block websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ prevalence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia @-@ users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been under articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ade of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the most famous country in the world , when it comes to the massive c@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several Mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia , and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and therefore make a complete c@@ ens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite legal prohibition , the content is acceptable . &quot;
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS tells about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we set everything from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they do not reach the www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ eler website . &quot;

used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos that he looked around around and never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with po@@ ison@@ ous moti@@ ves and un@@ washed colors .
&quot; the motivated him to carry him a camera , and try to gra@@ ze the situation . &quot;
then he was a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ as wildlife travels to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his home , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that len@@ ders the attention of Nep@@ al@@ et . &quot;
&quot; he described Facebook , like this first @-@ class situation in his work : &quot;
&quot; I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could it be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I rested not at home , when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam is just a few minutes from the tourist resort Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I took off with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stre@@ ushes a collaboration with the authorities to achieve worldwide recognition of Nep@@ als Nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful as they look like .
&quot; and he should know it , because he was standing on the face of his face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I was also because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ he@@ ks appeared . he immediately remembers , we look forward to the S@@ al trees ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ous nature and wild animals , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to do in the Bar@@ dia National Park photos of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days , it took up to 12 days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near tourist information . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and appeared originally on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was re @-@ released as part of a content sharing agreement again .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care , the names of their husbands , or even by older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women to respect the husband because of the social pressure on the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ ed to maintain this practice . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced to the Indian state O@@ wn@@ a by a head@@ court and led by her family and the village community after having responded to a married relations with name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives , too , is not common in the name , is also common among men . however , they have much less assign@@ ments to fear , if at all , they should not come to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place for them alone , to discuss the host@@ ile of the patri@@ arch@@ ate , and discuss . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which is in 13 Indian states , he is part of the # K@@ hel@@ bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for degra@@ dation of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was works for seven years with the help of their video camera , such as children &apos;s heating up to the agency of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS In@@ infected , and manages this clubs . &quot;
it reports how this club created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the bottom of the wall .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion round , acted by women who did not call their husbands at the name . &quot;
&quot; she opted for this topic , because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem , which the women can easily identify themselves . &quot;
&quot; to discuss the names of their husbands , a Br@@ ush who pleaded not guilty , and never questioned them in question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not enter this , is considered to be considered as a woman without moral . &quot;
&quot; the tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted , that we have never made a thought about this discussion round . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband before , had never called her name at home , as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ mother and my husband weigh still long after the video was at the end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me , and said , I should call him from now on his name . &quot;
&quot; with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started their first discussion lu@@ b . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; nor ever before . some believed that it meant a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy , anno@@ yed , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us how they want us to respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the break of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in whom married women to the name of their husbands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she had happened during the whole exercise , but another decided to release all the con@@ gest@@ ed fru@@ stration against him and his family , taking him cursed . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in fact , in the area of A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ ct , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call her husbands at the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports in the next few days .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas put them in his head : his wife could not stop to say his name .
another club member chose to do it with dinner before the entire family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she appe@@ aled , she was afraid , and said that it was an error . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women tried to stop other practices , such as the tra@@ verse of the interest in the forehead , which shows the trou@@ blem@@ an : &quot;
why only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if it was also . &quot;
&quot; he laugh@@ ed only , and I listened to him to bear him . &quot;
&quot; other women have not stopped completely , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose itself , not to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion sk@@ lu@@ b is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; we do a trip with every discussion sk@@ lu@@ b .
&quot; normally , we pack lunch and water and go out into the field . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to take care of the women who could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they d@@ anced and sang , and talked about things that they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet , I also have some things , for example like our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , certain things to say loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt of a pants , wear it not . &quot;
&quot; after much contro@@ versy and discussion about the advantages of the own wardrobe , mor@@ als are connected to the Sar@@ is and much more , dirty Roh@@ ini &apos;s own pair of Kur@@ t@@ as ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they now have decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a while they can wear Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether in the five months since their first discussion @-@ lu@@ b already changed , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly entering the rolls : &quot;
we have made only little steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then we stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , not included , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are included . &quot;
only one or two still say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
&quot; the women in discussion sk@@ lu@@ b know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the foot for more movement , or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate the river . &quot;
&quot; being aware of each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
&quot; but this club , each of us , gives us confidence that something will change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and other people , what we are talking about and what we do . &quot;
we are all sitting in the same boat .

screenshot of the official YouTube channel of the Beatles .
&quot; on June 29 , this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag of the opposite of the children ( Beatles @-@ Day ) was found in the Japanese Twitter trend , with which many fans j@@ umped memories and shared their valu@@ ations for the Beatles . &quot;
the visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered as a revers@@ er in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964 , noted on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days , the Beatles have been in the country , but this was enough to rotate the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; the people here is quite fast , that they didn &apos;t have any other choice than the Beatles have received with open arms . &quot;
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; says Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the individual trading of Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ kei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! , today The Beatles @-@ Day Day in Japan . during the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; even today , songs are sung by Beatles in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in English @-@ teaching Japanese medium schools . &quot;
the kit@@ sch of the Beatles survived everything .
today The Beatles @-@ memorial day .
we all love in our house The Beatles .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll by John Lenn@@ on is supposed to be or not .
&quot; and as it belongs to fans , Japanese of course do also make pil@@ low trips to the well @-@ known places that are related to the band . &quot;
&quot; if you love The Beatles , you are your 5 places you have to visit . &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry F@@ ields ( memorial in New York )

exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! made on a pilgrimage to London and ran across the Abbey Road .

&quot; and of course , some companies use the fan base also marketed as such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese nood@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! for today The Beatles @-@ memorial day . &quot;

&quot; a new system of gl@@ ancing people for organ trade , probably for super@@ imposed purposes , probably the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practition@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men killed in the district Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of organs were taken from .
&quot; two men were arrested and stood in the result , that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
it would give the local super@@ st@@ ition that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold enth@@ r@@ ents or wealth was declared to the BBC &apos;s police ra@@ cher by Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks were registered on glorious men in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the target of murdered victims for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this resulted in the South African country to investigate a mission in order to investigate this practition@@ er .
&quot; the persecution of people with alco@@ hol@@ ism is common in other countries in southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed to combat these super@@ st@@ ition and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;

&quot; over the last days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha divided the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers of the poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , which clari@@ fies that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , of which Mozambique is opposite : &quot;

a photo of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia that probably had been recently made .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of arrested Chinese dis@@ sidents Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o pulled attention in the international community attention , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June , that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed for liver cancer in the final stage of the end stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison because of &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State of State ) , after gradu@@ ating on the draft of Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o which urges democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has called Li@@ us case as &quot; an internal matter , &quot; he tells it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel prize lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , and allow him to permit a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; poin@@ ter R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner of the United Nations for Human Rights , arrived at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker , however , refused to comment if the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Liu in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway fell into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded by Liu , although the Norwegian government has agreed that this would have nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations were resumed only in December of last year . Norway signed an agreement in order to re @-@ establish the salmon trip to China because the exports had been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to express their hope for unconditional release and invited Liu a to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his detention , he was not able to oppos@@ e his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision to liber@@ ate Liu and his wife immediately to free from the house arrest and allow him to seek emergency support , where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called Li@@ us for the release of Li@@ us , as they said in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect to elev@@ ate all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; you should meet all visits and can be received , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outer world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans would wish him , that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in@@ corporate it in his satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the message of the news agency AFP on June 27 , that the message of the Chinese authorities not only allow Liu X@@ ia to free from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy was a fur@@ ious answer from China to themselves , with the outside of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , that &quot; no country have the right to participate in reasonable and ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple following :
&quot; for example , protection and freedom such as travel information and access to the medical care of his choice , which they are entitled to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to dis@@ connect Liu and his wife . &quot;

Germany
&quot; the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that Liu &quot; all receives medical support which he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on July 7 and 8 , at the G20 summit in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; earlier , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reuters that China had great concerns whether the vort@@ ex could overs@@ ha@@ dow Liu &apos;s visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China urged China to provide an appropriate medical care to provide and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told Rachel that Li@@ us woman , Liu X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to contact with someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um tells about :
&quot; Canada calls for China to compens@@ ate its international human rights issues , including freedom of expression , to true and allowing for exercising this rights to be blocked . &quot;

&quot; in a statement on June 29 , France &apos;s foreign Ministry urged China to release some of the humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o will receive all treatments that he , regardless where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family will have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news book France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information , if France will eventually take him . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; on June 27 , China , the Council of Fest@@ o in Taiwan called on June 27 to show Liu fre@@ eing and a larger tolerance towards those who require peaceful funds to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , from the ruling Democratic Pro@@ gress Party , also called China to allow the sick of intellec@@ tu@@ aries to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in a statement on June 28 by Liu very worried and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and was strictly punished for which he had been strictly punished , more stable and prosper@@ ous of China had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and encouraged me when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question seems stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam should be considered as a city .
this remark triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the conference on a meeting of the International branch of the State of the State of New York , the ministers noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports that Singapore should be considered as a city .
... nobody has asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; it is , with most people commit a mistake . &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io acc@@ uses the Minister of Justice to twist logic , &quot; to defend logic in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercising of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed , to create this valuable country , we hear that we should not be any country at the end . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had a escape before the responsibilities , a mandatory injury . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he appeared in@@ consp@@ ic@@ ably less democratic . &quot;
&quot; however , in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally towns that are led permanently from a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the focal point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian sei@@ z@@ ards come back to the present Democrats , the twi@@ sted logic , because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , in the final week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were given answers to its American guests regarding our press , our youth ative , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
appropriate questions w@@ asted with non @-@ answers r@@ ational type .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to illustr@@ ate his opinion , because they didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is to which country is owned by ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our wer@@ ter K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clari@@ fy this point , if it became high , to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment posted on the reviews that it should begin to read the entire story of the conference to understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the inscription .
&quot; he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; to be considered a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so un@@ easier , even if we are free and righteous choices . &quot;
he joined Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw decades a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; wasn &apos;t a country , &quot; he obviously does not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam who makes a leader of a her@@ al@@ able generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
&quot; I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - was I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is what he defended . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review sets the weak@@ nesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; committed a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ scher speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique and it is equally country and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role in the government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do they afford a military service , but they defend their own city , but not their own country ? &quot;
who must pay our prime bills ?
what is the value of our pink personnel ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to spring , Singapore is always a town : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to be sc@@ and@@ alized many of the people ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially , etc . , but that &apos;s not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked short of its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; their answers will be published as part of a ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et will be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , and answer me . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation , the conversation takes place , it is regarded as pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation with personal questions . &quot;
&quot; usually the standard answer follows : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly before anger when they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t b@@ other@@ ed me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little who distingu@@ ishes the Canadian of Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well to their back@@ pack , when they are travelling . &quot;
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , however , ... . &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march of Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans always have small map@@ le sheets in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gender equality has been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the toler@@ ant country opposite ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I ad@@ mi@@ red much . &quot;
&quot; it would not make me nothing if you would go to Johnny from Dallas , for example . &quot;
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; nice &quot; means to be called , is basically to be sk@@ in@@ ely , as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically un@@ important figure N@@ ed Flanders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian doubles ) . &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flanders would be a step forward . but the actual problem exists that &quot; nice &quot; does not have personality .
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing that can hit . &quot;
harmless to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and no attention to deserve .
&quot; this can be something good when you wish to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that pass around . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the wish is free and to be alone , a major member of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what outdoor &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence using the neighbors .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open kindness , which I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au then entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada almost sexy . &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ ert Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video published in Thailand &apos;s famous pop band , which took the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and re@@ plen@@ ish the civilian government in 2014 , continues to re@@ prove the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band tat@@ too , describes a young man who tells about his girlfriend his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the persistent military regime of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country . &quot;
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 254 times and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to view this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in particular , as it is the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta domin@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; once again , check out these images of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand have been har@@ assed over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; possibly refer to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which the commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the He@@ eres has given an absolute decision on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; rel@@ ates to the in@@ famous program for &quot; placing change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are regarded as critics from the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to ver@@ ti@@ fy activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , the online content monitored and individuals who accused of having accused the monarchy to have been prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand oppos@@ es a stri@@ ving against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic di@@ ligence ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was right in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continued to sell , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax ev@@ ils . &quot;
&quot; even in the video , how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans , before they bring them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and they are threatened to ins@@ ult the monarchy to ins@@ ulting the monarchy .
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members of the band who had used the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which had already been used by coup d &apos;@@ etat during the protests in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war company recovered only very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now , more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ian War was officially ended , but his sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , South Asia , Geor@@ g@@ iers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and abor@@ tions live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called the ghost town in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in this ghost town . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; the empty five @-@ storey apartment blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called ch@@ u@@ ch@@ t@@ schu@@ ko@@ w@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native man .
he starts a conversation and it falls to him hard to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is unique . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens , who served all the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with infl@@ atable practice buildings .
&quot; people who once lived in this place , and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , approximately fifty inhabitants live . &quot;
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which can still accommodate one or two families , one recognizes on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to show us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just forbidden it , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers in her friend and suddenly leaving the destroyed buildings and disappear .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence industry ( cultivation of agricultural products for the property ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

Gal@@ ina wants to accept any financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sted that she has supported her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;

but we cannot do this constantly - everybody is busy with its own problems . &quot;

Nat@@ asha &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ alya her . &quot; they said we could build a zu@@ cchini .
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything , &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation part@@ n@@ in Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds of the thorn before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in central rus@@ sia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ ch@@ Asia broke out ) , they didn &apos;t leave the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that this building were destroyed during the war .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken was released on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , and published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a cor@@ ps and gold tones and gold coloured earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many of the name M@@ om Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a goal for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are in transit .
the hotel rather has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the entrance there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast to call it : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present , Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time in this year . &quot;
there are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on boxes .
she wants to refuse anybody .
&quot; she helps them also , and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay them , they massive them with a bal@@ m from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived before a short time . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; &quot; I really feel that it fits to her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to re@@ find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans that are on the way to the United States to make normal first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other directions from Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells that the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often go together the way , that Afri@@ cans speak to What@@ s@@ App by Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his guide , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest at M@@ om Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the Bu@@ stu@@ et to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I wonder if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mom Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again , &quot; &quot; he answered smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that her guests are often sending text messages when they have continued to gr@@ asp her , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps well known here , but it is not the only spar@@ ken hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a s@@ ack@@ g@@ asse leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; in this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family moved to migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is Po@@ lic@@ ist and has found that the Bu@@ stu@@ ets are sold to many African migrants too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to receive a reasonable price , then he offered them his home for one dollar . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blank@@ ets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help others . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he moved out after a raid on his working place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an all @-@ stone , offered her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , travelers consult their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; today , a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a stum@@ bled grandmother , she leaves their album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that you made a sp@@ in , some photos of their grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laugh@@ ed sad while she briefly introduces them .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ gues , &quot; she repeated every time . &quot; &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in Tian@@ shan District of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile notification that it shows the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , the app will be said that the app will get access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app , messages with a private we@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the notification of the police , the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of terrorists and track , together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Trojan and Ph@@ ishing pages to make users interested , how much time they spend online , and remote control their own home network . &quot;
this app with filters for min@@ ors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can be used naturally in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers could be able to manipul@@ ate home network of a person or steal it from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ing internet connections . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( with the b@@ b@@ ons of the b@@ ail@@ er ) , the cen@@ sored news in China showed photos of a chec@@ point , on which polic@@ emen were in@@ discri@@ min@@ ately checked , whether they were installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ in@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected on a chec@@ point with a device without these software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for the technological development .
&quot; you have comp@@ elled the people to use devices who are intended for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the watch@@ making technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; &quot; ( for the next @-@ house of the b@@ b@@ ons ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , which means that the software can raise the license requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ in@@ jiang are too electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minim@@ ize the spread of illegal contents .
&quot; all government officials , authorities and with the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security office during operation of their computer and communications equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , an American Human Rights Organization , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang the authorities published on June 27 in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , with the order to all residents and entrepreneurs , until August 1 , their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy . this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible publishers , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; Sle@@ ep or Death , &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane has helped his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you watch you and make sure you &apos;re alone on a place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved after and dissolved , and reveals a truth , which is clearly visible , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes their names all honor .
one who has beaten up in a list of feelings and expressions that allow no met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you recover the reality and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and the actors - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt , in smoke , and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is on the axis of the un@@ healing . you are clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone was erected . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to make &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; &quot; as the chief of security services - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he introduced his power over us , by even destroyed the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn during a peaceful prot@@ ections like Un@@ dar@@ nel from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to cut off the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ Schrei@@ er . &quot;
&quot; all neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , in@@ comprehen@@ sible , at the wrong time , even if I have no high demands to a town which is to put into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little calm after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
I crossed the silence that I cried out several times &quot; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice through the silence .
&quot; few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were greeted with a splendid picture that fulfilled my expectations and fulfilled all . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment it will be aware that you have delivered the Spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in barley . &quot;
&quot; I got a call from my father : &quot; &quot; make you ready , we meet with the military safety building . &quot;
he laid up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you swal@@ low - nothing can give you your voice , after you gave you all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; let me listen to me as you &apos; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &apos; , or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry when we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his h@@ ass@@ filled eyes were built upon me .
&quot; and you dream of what to look to me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old . I was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure when I answered , &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I am not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; it is in sol@@ itary and his father , like this . &quot;
&quot; his father immediately with this . &quot;
the gest@@ ure of this cursed sat@@ a is up to me in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ el@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I am going through the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything back with me . &quot;
&quot; then again through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I prepared all the details exactly before I look for the room .
&quot; otherwise , they have given me a larger cell for me this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one another prisoner , and must put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I took up a well @-@ proven communication method : with the fist on the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ Ã¤@@ ft@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after long hes@@ itation , he answered me finally . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in any of the surrounding cells there was a respected man in the middle age that looks similar to me and &quot; the doctor &quot; is called . &quot;
&quot; in the perfect darkness , there are no distinctive facial features , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all answers are connected to its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the large cells .
perhaps he is listening to immediately .
&quot; investig@@ ator had assured me , they would fre@@ eing him when I stay . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would like to have a bird afraid to drive all these cro@@ ws , who lab@@ s in the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; out of the distance , I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu ac@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always around this time the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black the colour of the corru@@ p@@ ens is , until I saw the yellow light , which gave us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ unders , &quot; turn on 13 S@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
&quot; they are here , to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; thus , the secret was praised : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak at the al@@ a@@ wit@@ ic dial@@ ect - thus they played their con@@ spir@@ ational map of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country . it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the crimin@@ als of their c@@ lans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I look for the listening room and meet Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that de@@ can@@ opy him : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can stop so much more import@@ antly with your life , you can close to demonstrations , who will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I &apos;ve used it to answer not .
I can really say more exactly when Bel@@ ei@@ ades and stro@@ kes after a friendly conversation has become an ordinary communication agent .
when and how that happened was in@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to it , to be punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this sentence . &quot;
a punishment in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to plu@@ ck me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he is called the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the clo@@ ak .
your hen f@@ eig@@ ned at your scre@@ am .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you can &apos;t keep your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry had not been afraid of him yet , so that it was cast out of the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a gar@@ bage , or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables in one another , to present us , out of their sight , great invention of a giant cab@@ els . &quot;
&quot; three of them occur within one hour , while I was still in the series . &quot;
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice , which I heard . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ker noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it , so that he was next to an electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity perme@@ ates my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ nu@@ cle@@ ated body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect electricity head . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night . &quot;
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep myself again ; let &apos;s say that this was my only option .
some hours passed that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning bet .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light meets the room &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ sti@@ ve youth , &quot; &quot; My lord , my father has to worry about . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they were always free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b talks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ d@@ ai@@ b puts the most of his time inside ; sometimes it is to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but on what you can leave , a cigarette between his fingers , or with nic@@ ot@@ ine defiled her lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top of his family house , which had been part of the West Bank since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine , where they had lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has been a passionate activist , which is transferred to the conservative majority , and their alt@@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free expression of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , often opposed to topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian poultry , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only found in his hom@@ etown of Amman Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that are in Yemen from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b sees itself as a man who is not affected in his thinking through limits , and he can feel the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it is not open , he puts a special ab@@ norm@@ ality against US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b considers his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
H@@ d@@ ai@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas - even if he was born in Jordan as he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own living conditions , &quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b emphas@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a person , while in water sol@@ est nest @-@ cafe in two cups . it is the Holy month of Ram@@ ad@@ an ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law states that public consumption of food during Ram@@ ad@@ an is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the gap of loud coffee and the sciss@@ ors of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom .
&quot; sometimes , Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky , especially if you thro@@ ws a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is avo@@ id@@ able to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to land not in prison . &quot;
recently the Interior Minister Jord@@ an@@ ians had to be cancelled at the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila for the second time .
&quot; some Parliament ordered to support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the homos@@ exual fron@@ tier Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradi@@ cted the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country , and the main reason for the concert table is . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN says that the concert &quot; was cancelled &quot; because of sexual orientation of the prison . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous acti@@ vism , which represents the ancient legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila estimated the Jord@@ anian nation as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to use for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not easy to be used rhet@@ oric , but indeed a distinct cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b traditional gender nor@@ ms in the body , made his vision of the fate of Arab women , have vo@@ iced sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of a evi@@ den@@ ced unknown woman , whose arms and legs are tracks up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past years , the number of &quot; Hon@@ mor@@ de &apos; has risen in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary moral reached its peak in 2016 ; however , Jordan is still missing that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support victims of murder or domestic violence to support appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law governing law in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of non @-@ family violence , &quot; and for their release , often a lon@@ ely bureaucr@@ atic effort , and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for this , even not before topics to rever@@ t in his country long as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , dre@@ aming that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explic@@ it ass@@ ump@@ tions on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression of expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; he became politics in me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &apos; Edward Sa &apos; ed , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; focus on poverty in turn .
&quot; the list of the songs , which are politically , can continue . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ d@@ ai@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
&quot; in this song , a verse is repeated often : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the songs H@@ d@@ ai@@ b describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can get what you want &quot; - be faith or non@@ believe , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he not@@ ices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and reading , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored until 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from the context , revol@@ ves and his opinion were cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but it was only a worked version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b is open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als do not dis@@ agree to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ es , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in memory today thanks to his hom@@ o@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ d@@ ai@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ das , who later should work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph later , could write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ ians do that ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices shall be put into silence . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took a number of former government members and members of the teaching position , with the grounds that they had expressed themselves on comments in social media , with which deeply ro@@ oted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ d@@ ai@@ bs concert is , according to the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to work out a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a permanent gene and take away . Jordan has left M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; L@@ eila for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society will take place . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , also dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad . &quot;
&quot; he doesn &apos;t dream about it , his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience her . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is inspired by music , art and literature of a genuine and basic op@@ enn@@ ess - and not through bombs , stre@@ um@@ erable and to artificial democracy . at least , he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is done , H@@ d@@ ai@@ b will continue to de@@ d@@ olls and also resist resistance . &quot;
&quot; this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , to which A@@ man li@@ stens to a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big and extra@@ vag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous the@@ ories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; one thought that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually over a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival . another theory states that the arrest , the drums , and dancing over a thousand years , have been invaded and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , Em@@ ishi in the knee . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab a couple of great seats , therefore we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari . &quot;
I &apos;ve been looking forward to the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two p@@ ush@@ ers are straight ahead .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and another stunning way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the view of a 18 @-@ metre high arrest was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care , as important as in this story , because they help to promote Peru@@ vian youth from the crime and promote a legitim@@ ate profession like the hair@@ dresser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic centre of the capital Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoking and illegal drugs are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 was that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - how many other medium and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ y@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers who can form this elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts join each other there to show who can see the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks as you can see in the following video ( further videos for current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the School Augusto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to change young people against hair@@ dresser and instead of getting a training in hair@@ dresser &apos;s hair , which enables them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunity , dozens of teenagers have seen dozens of teenagers that they can take a job , who is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; before the school year , the school offered special training workshops in March , reported about some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district of which we are very proud , because of love to the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters

use with friendly permission .
the following article is the revised version of the Beit@@ ra@@ gs &quot; Prin@@ ciples of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the post will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who feel stretched out , aff@@ ection ? &quot;
&quot; exactly this question went the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga by the Foundation Bog@@ ot@@ os and Cri@@ sti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired them to write the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) , the young people encouraged to write gu@@ err@@ illa letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
the subject of peace agreement was considered so important that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services .
&quot; in front of the Colombia , however , it is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , who lived for many years in illegal camps , were exposed to a war rhet@@ oric and around the clock their weapons will have to be put into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian company , in turn , who had used to live in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , this has to take place in their ranks , and support them in the building of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an were convinced that the young Colombia had to close together and help the integration process .
and exactly that they did : until now already thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , which are then personally handed over . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate who took place in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there were Leonardo and Cri@@ sti@@ an &apos;s opportunity to speak soon with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
&quot; this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters , but those forgotten they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told us further to share his love with people who needed most urgent promise in this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former milit@@ ants of the F@@ ARC . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I have never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students from J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana University in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the foundation of Bog@@ ot@@ Art in the camp to get the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC arose so , as they had done it earlier to receive the commands of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of sub@@ s@@ ation of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings you can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between , &quot; &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter took me by the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa man who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him there was a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; I answered him , and asked , &quot; H@@ ello , what do they do ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I reply to a letter which someone has written to me . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never in my life , someone has something so beautiful , that is why I answer it . &quot; I suddenly heard the tears of the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I embra@@ ced him , and set me beside the pomegran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this cap , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had something else from life than war . in the F@@ ARC , the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I have never thought that someone would be forgiven me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know there is a society outside there , who waits with open arms to us . &quot;
&quot; until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace is there , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the start , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together in a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grew up as early as war and the F@@ ARC was already in the bor@@ row .
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC declared the story of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years we experienced how the opportunity to develop us to a political party , we can help to design the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; these people , who have never been heard and had no voting rights , and to know that people who have often seen as a monster , and they even hate people with beautiful feelings , who were surrounded by their lifestyle and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me , that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm have caused us to bring us something and a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; for example , Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote as Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the City of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
&quot; in Colombia , Colombia was prophesied that after de@@ fo@@ rest@@ ation of peace . &quot;
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons and to protest for their rights . and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the def@@ enders of peace , no matter what race , religion or ideology - to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , afford our contribution , and bring sacrifices , because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are coming . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homos@@ exual and que@@ er people living in Caucas@@ us region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical violence and sexual violence . &quot;
&quot; with fear , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months over the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which depends on the LGB@@ T@@ Q congregation , is not only about the night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked with us what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya took the headlines in several months before the international headlines , having published reports , torture and murder of que@@ erer men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , susp@@ ect susp@@ icious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a Trans@@ ition , was born in Gros@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; ever since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown , you became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safer place for her , which she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Che@@ chens from the sexual activity , the hunt was opened on Sabrina . &quot;
&quot; from fear for her life , she moved to the United States last end . &quot;
Sabrina : I was working as a volunteer in human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone , from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he swallowed them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can eliminate this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the round by What@@ s@@ app . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just there , I heard a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my cars , I heard a male child say , &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a set , but this time on bye bye bye to Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you honor the family still ? &quot;
I did not know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and a@@ woke up the final end of the hospital .
apparently some women had to get started and started to cry .
the man had fled .
the women had a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two j@@ ails in my right lung wings . &quot;
OC Media : in which nur@@ ses were you laid - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he is respec@@ tful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some completely un@@ known . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family has been visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the requested to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd demands : some told me , I have to prove it by going on without the streets ; others wanted me not changed my family that everything was only bad , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grains size C - what should I say in television ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it is still difficult for them .
some older people said to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is disappointed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a snare around the neck . &quot;
fortunately the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , there was a car with a dark window discs and a number plate with a number of 95 . &quot;
&quot; after the third time it was happening , I was clear that there was a little la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights @-@ friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give their names , but I don &apos;t want to remember them all . they really have helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can still understand how it could .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother , once I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought them without register without ID , without identification . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card in my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe in safety , just because you left the country ? &quot;
people know already in which hotel you are plug@@ ged . you even know your room number .
just to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : do you still stand in touch with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a table theme . &quot;
&quot; some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements , I still bear in myself . &quot;
so much I wish you can &apos;t overcome this se@@ el@@ ic barrier .
&quot; I say always , that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give a lot of effort to look like the person from their past - so on my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed ? &quot;
Sabrina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
for whom I needed current information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I talked with someone who had a one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ram@@ ad@@ an , he was arrested and tortured , but also , that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will focus on family and relatives .
&quot; so that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : are now even gay men detained in these secret places ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it was not very many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped from their relatives to present Kad@@ y@@ rows court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they may present themselves later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , you will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; however , these people wouldn &apos;t just have disappeared but targeted to radic@@ alize themselves . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a delay or have a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I just wanted someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he says that many people had disappeared in this prison , after their be@@ ard was grown . &quot;
there was nothing new of them ever since .
they simply have taken away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was even when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , however , they were not presented as band@@ its , but there were still no reports until now . we dis@@ cour@@ aged that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not be allowed to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these pursu@@ es and dis@@ appearances of people , who had a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already found in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I always wore my hair for ever .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known in Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sch@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; civilian &quot; , &quot; but ultimately he finally thrown back into the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were cut off , and I had coloured l@@ ashes , bore a tube , and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Defence of Sch@@ aria has never shot me a hair .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met with me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and all the town knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been off@@ ended .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a Rede@@ emer : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ ell not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , when they make more than sick people . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never ins@@ ulting me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this mercy time mean ?
Sabrina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row entered the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about moral . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had landed before and landed , consider yourself with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
in the time I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily s@@ acked . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go to ?
Sabrina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ch .
I do not earn a lot of $ 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA .
&quot; in addition , I still worked as a activist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I testim@@ oni@@ als with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ ac@@ ies , meetings , I send them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to pay a long p@@ enny .
I discovered these people myself when I ab@@ stain@@ ed a refuge .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; so , nature , that &apos;s purely nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Che@@ chens , who want to do with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no tails with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have Kab@@ ar@@ din@@ er , who also have Russians , but there are they that are on all the planet , but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from Caucas@@ us Caucas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims go into the mosque and fa@@ sten during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experience . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact , different living settings . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and do not harm me for my body . &quot;
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups war@@ n before an increase of self @-@ mor@@ den within the poor Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i community in Iran
the Iranian ancest@@ ral region suffer from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase of self @-@ moral . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab ancest@@ or community in Iran , which is influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the South@@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he che@@ ered for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness that can come to the in@@ ability of his family , so Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; watching a YouTube video on YouTube , the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself . &quot;
&quot; some people made it fast to er@@ ase the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the valley hospital in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , deep@@ enings were so strong that doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arabian Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i minority , and activists from the spot that even more men could take life . &quot;
the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hanged . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers , who felt and unable to feed their families because of persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty and unemployment and discrimination
&quot; the region , where a large part of the Arab ancest@@ or community is based in Iran , was severely affected by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny its living conditions . &quot;
&quot; in a century ago , Arabian Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power over and 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the upcoming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the weal@@ thi@@ est and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite this valuable resources , the regional economy continues only slowly , and the native population receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victim of untreated diseases , hunger and kidn@@ apping . &quot;
the Iranian regime are systematically ref@@ using Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically mis@@ ses jobs in the local oil and gas and petro@@ chemical industry .
&quot; the government also has a multitude of dam@@ men , built up water from the Arab areas in the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s only led to destroy those in the region through dr@@ y@@ ness caused desol@@ ation , and the local agriculture , as well as fish and palm @-@ pal@@ ms . &quot;
the unemployment rate below the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for cooperation , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is , who are looking for a work that ended primary school , 55 % of the secondary school finished and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activist , with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment , and assistance of ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of self @-@ mor@@ den under the young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly the unemployment has become worse . reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the process process :
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions pre@@ fers not to set Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will have access to work possibilities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living conditions outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their predecess@@ ors to hide their affili@@ ation to Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i to hide and so an@@ gled , since even Arab names will not be toler@@ ated at the workplace , because the speech of Arabic language or the Arab clothes are not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that the Arab ancest@@ w@@ az@@ i must endure , h@@ itting human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
&quot; it remains to be waiting , whether the world is w@@ akes up and taking knowledge . &quot;
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and committed suicide .

&quot; why don &apos;t I agree with the femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ se@@ ction@@ als &quot;
detail of a photos . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons License .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion , written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; if I say that I &apos;m not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as an inter@@ se@@ ct@@ oral femin@@ ists - with Fr@@ ust . &quot;
they wonder why I &apos;m not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be femin@@ ist and why we generally should be all femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , women nowadays still earn less money at the same time as men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under str@@ ingent observation , when it comes to what they can do with their bodies . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination are still across the many different countries and belie@@ fs . &quot;
all this is aware and well known .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I am talking to skin color , on Black C@@ is @-@ women , black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I promise to mention both white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ction@@ als , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ se@@ ct@@ als were silent . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to get the equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexual violence , there are an institutional form of assi@@ sting violence that we are exposed to black women to two times . &quot;
or about that black women and women of other eth@@ nic@@ ities and adolescents were less earn than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with mig@@ rant back@@ grounds are more often referred to school than white girls because of obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sp@@ inal and women with migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the other hand , I want all the women , all men , and all men , every skin and all men &apos;s rights ; on the other hand , I cannot consider as a black woman , in whose center the white woman is to take into account that affect both gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m exhausted and I will not fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented spy , that always and countless other black women and ever rejected . &quot;
&quot; in 1851 , So@@ jour@@ ner accused 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to preserve an ideology in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ gin@@ alised nature . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their eg@@ o@@ cent@@ ric program . &quot;
&quot; I will not try to try white women the importance of exagger@@ ating skin colour and gender , because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different heart information and to borders of white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself full and completely from femin@@ ism , who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of me for a white femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so hard @-@ dirty , that Inter@@ se@@ ction@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women in our own performances and we go into the sp@@ inning , which will be created by us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing O@@ ur@@ selves ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can help ourselves ) that we can defend ourselves on our own way . and not only that - black women can also be rever@@ ed to them that make us completely safe and even spiritual elements , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and interactive femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradi@@ ctions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of my dark skin because of my existence as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither exagger@@ ated , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ addle against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
&quot; always again , Nabil Mus@@ a traveled to the last 7 years - usually with surf board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . its mission aims to make people the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who declared us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river , which we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all the country fear that the decades of war , construction of storage , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers , a subsidiary of Water@@ art@@ ender Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers , streams and water routes in Iraq , as well as the local communities in sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the pressures and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we don &apos;t have any water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bi@@ l , in Er@@ bi@@ l , Iraq @-@ based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist , produced , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the emphasis on their work is followed , little notable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by using co@@ oper@@ ative video and new multimedia techniques , with their help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their way . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ e@@ dec ) that reports the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police Commissioner A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ ouse who had become violent over violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship , some time has passed and the police said , her statement would not be laid , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as a further woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , also the acute indication of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez has never used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back . &quot;
&quot; to break the devil in violence against women , it is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if women are ever refund at all , they generally receive support from the Sta@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of women who admit to be victims of violence at all . &quot;
&quot; att@@ aching 1 stro@@ kes and Stati@@ stic 2 Un@@ seen Mis@@ sions and a Legal System , which does not under@@ mm@@ mm@@ ing the laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gen@@ der@@ wonder at Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various information and reports that will not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however the numbers available are al@@ ar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Prosecutor of 9@@ 600 ads went to domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of advertis@@ ements in the police came from women .
&quot; there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace . 86 % of the signs of women came here . &quot;
&quot; in the advertis@@ ements , 40 % of women reported that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di only few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman who are not refundable in Paraguay for mental abuse , there are 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse . &quot;
&quot; as women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is no own off@@ ences , the prosecution authority cannot be appropriate as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mis@@ uses and a legal system that has nothing to under@@ take
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called his name for all of her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then it was after . this should always regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no more with Carlos together . but for two years she bore psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , recogni@@ zable : &quot;
I have never thought that I would have a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
&quot; when I read it earlier , I thought that only women had happened to under@@ take it , because they are dec@@ eive of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , they wrote contributions on Facebook , in which they described his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he had ever raised the hand against them , and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they did so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave it earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost so , when they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain fellow to blame . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner is mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te CRE@@ O network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all in any way victims of failure .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the testimony of women seriously .
&quot; in Vict@@ ori@@ as case , everything started with mental abuse . &quot;
&quot; finally , her wealthy partners managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads at the authorities remained without earnings , and also by their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against their former partner , who developed to an un@@ mistak@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly for money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; NATO &apos;s laws : good approach , fla@@ wed implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of Mis@@ uses is a track full of resistance and fighting against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems with the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , the bill was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ el@@ las ( # Princip@@ al ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ in@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law looks forward to explain fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent off@@ ences and harder to pun@@ ish , as it is already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; in some points , the legisl@@ est@@ ext changed in some points to be able to gain the MPs for the law that the way to de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions may be forbidden to be punished and sentenced to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill provided that the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) process will have to carry the victims of violence even if they just want to refund and receive a secure accommodation , to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ator does not provide sufficient financial funds to provide : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of human relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking is to take place , that violence is no more than a bit noisy . &quot;
&quot; in view of this facts , he is guilty and contributes to that the perpet@@ rators will come up . &quot;
&quot; we need to make such a long ad , until failure is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , but among other things , a passage in cases of domestic violence was called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are going apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the ag@@ gres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice .
&quot; however , the string of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great return . &quot;
this article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; from Kur@@ ier . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft @-@ e@@ dec ) that reports the violence against women in Paraguay .

independent media in Oman will continue to ban attacks in Oman by a newspaper .
&quot; this website was closed due to a decision of the information Minister &quot; &quot; on the website of the forbidden Newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried to be tried again later . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn Said which came to power after he had set his father , Said i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then he held his role as the only Sultan , the principal offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander in the Armed Forces , Minister of Defence , Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ ans is characterized by the har@@ vest@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular the domestic secret service , the public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and human rights def@@ ender , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ date and detained . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restri@@ ct peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the field of human rights systematically and citizens , also activists , remember their views on public matters of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n paper , its closure and the detention of three of their editors in the last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 over corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until they were banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , said after being published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 , following the title of &quot; &quot; High @-@ day parties &quot; &quot; was a article entitled &quot; &quot; High @-@ Day parties &quot; &quot; and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused of having placed the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure , a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;
&quot; issue of paper Az@@ am@@ n , July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ he Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took the deputy Chief Editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had appointed Chief Editor for Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed at an unlimited time after the information minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on every way , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , before the court in Mas@@ kat the first trial was held in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j have been sentenced both among other things due to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; excav@@ ation of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violations of an audience and s@@ lander .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three @-@ year prison terms and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition an one @-@ year vocational training was hanged against both journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a fine fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after completing the use of an information grid to spread the material that could be found guilty of public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i a security deposit was established in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on August 22 , 2016 before the judgement of prison . &quot;
&quot; the Appeals Court , Al @-@ Abr@@ i , acquitted on 26 December 2016 , sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was dismissed on 10 April 2017 after the prison sentence of his six @-@ month sentence from the Central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence sentence .
the Appeals Court also took the decision of the information Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper sees itself as before attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the information minister sent an order to which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the information Minister signed a further assignment in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the ministers turned again against the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the release of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the constant closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases , in which Oman was injured in recent times the press freedom . &quot;
&quot; for further injuries include the closure of the independent journal Mo@@ w@@ in and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to put their operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the lasting closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not willing to prepare an end to the extensive violation of press freedom . &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists may follow their job ; &quot;
3 . protect the freedom of freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances , human rights and journalists in Oman will im@@ pose their legal human rights and without fear of failure , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , human rights def@@ ender ( also independent journalists , blo@@ gger , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather peac@@ efully , supported and providing them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , Figure 5 with his understanding &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely found or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the required medical research on site . there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines to cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have a great problem in the poorest countries of Africa in the poorest countries of Africa through pharmaceutical companies are a big problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research that is carried out by African scientists to develop their own research capacity in Africa . a larger role in science and technology can only be positive for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for the exploration of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was first engraved on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he explored the HIV virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and over mis@@ understanding of the media on these research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the emphasis lies on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische National Programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just start a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always keep the recipi@@ ents , instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get , are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult it is to find suitable scientists for projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are well promoted differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who come back or want to go back here , because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : how is the opinion of public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but just a very limited understanding science methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in the schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is astonishing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there are demand for special scientific training starting in every age .
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ transferable and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientist in Africa from Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often the limited speed , things to do , and the greater access to scientific expertise , which represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change worldwide food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been fighting in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ el , the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts in space and has been consumed . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years of work , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was placed only by his own income and the question , how many salads can be received , borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to use them again . &quot;
&quot; the patents have not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past years , more such patents have been applied to more plants like cereals or cartridges . due to this trends provide plant@@ ations , environmental protection and experts for food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on still needs a salad , but it is now longer , because his work is still worth more restrictions . &quot;
&quot; it is , as would lie in a river a rock , to whom I have to go . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents will go too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before court , no one can breed any new sal@@ at@@ eries because all the features are already patented . &quot; he is doing so good as possible and trying to recover those features , which he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , however , he is very careful and ende@@ avo@@ red to use any material which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he joined a movement that is becoming bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source of source ( &quot; Open Source &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red tube sal@@ at in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station and eaten . there will be tested , whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

&quot; it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area , and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; Open Source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software .
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gene are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders are usable permanently . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , in short O@@ ss@@ i , US bre@@ eders can be under@@ going to under@@ take the fact that others can freely use them far@@ med seed . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they can &apos;t continue with their seed , and can sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow others to cross their seed , to cross the own varieties , and it is not immediately banned - two aspects that are banned by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seeds have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark outlook
&quot; for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for nutrition security and for environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to his seed , seed plays a role in larger combination such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg is emphas@@ ized that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , we need control of organic farming or not . &quot; &quot; who is good , locally and sustain@@ ably productive vegetables , as for example , we need control over the crops , as for example , the way that this vegetables should be bred , threatened . &quot;
&quot; food sovereign , without seed @-@ sovereign , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensure other their seed still freely available . thus , you are going to patented seed and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argu@@ ed that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool because of the most numerous intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , CEO of O@@ ss@@ i , has been engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic vari@@ ation at carrots and their availability . she found out that approximately one @-@ third of all cart@@ ons are protected as intellectual property , making it either not or only worthy to be used . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , there are no such estimates yet , but experts like Lu@@ by missed that massage plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots . &quot;
a Question of Vis@@ itors
&quot; plants are so bred , so they are able to achieve targeted characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves until such , due to which they flour@@ ish or threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders increases by increasingly more patents . however , genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before , because the changes in changes through climate change is much worse pre@@ dict@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ banks and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States , the company is set up for maintaining the genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , you contradi@@ ct that the intellectual property of other bre@@ eders including &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ ability innovations &quot; . &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow , as soon as the patent is expired . &quot;
often this instructions can help others to come with another method to the same result .
&quot; such protection in@@ hib@@ its innovation , does not support innovation , but promotes the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees the different : 20 years to wait until a patent change , and certainly no innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have already lost . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and there should remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to simpli@@ fy farmers .
&quot; this is what we will feel , and it is impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on is distur@@ bed in the concept to patented plant features : &quot; we do not create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them , and as bre@@ eders we don &apos;t have any idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety , are also breeding his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture , with big farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for growing her@@ bi@@ oci@@ des , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is accurate . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding , or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eders Frank Mort@@ on is looking for in his breeding garden Sal@@ ates .

&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders would be innovative by the prevention of plant pat@@ ern@@ ers : &quot; it looks like I have to produce something new , more strongly than companies , the pat@@ enting . &quot;
&quot; I do constantly need new material for my catalog , since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is just 20 years ago , where@@ with it is easy to make it very nice . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , but the concept spreads out fast on all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the centre of sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to breed certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to get to &quot; open source &quot; seed and sell their own .
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union .
&quot; ( regulations for bre@@ eders differ from country to country , absent because O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be patented . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent , that patents on conventional plants are permitted . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States to put the patent office to implement these new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference to &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , focusing on farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos; program for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for which scheduled next year of official starting signal should fall . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , International Non@@ profit @-@ Development Organisation US@@ C Canada and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and other - published a report . it represents the opportunity to share and improve the seed policy to ensure that a stable supply of food safety can be ensured . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a diverse , local supply of seed with seed for sustainable food systems is st@@ resses - a connection between the Lu@@ by by O@@ ss@@ i , hopes that it will soon be seen more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement of regional and ecological foods has primarily respected , where and how slightly grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest targets of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian authorities in the Internet .
this time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend , the Egyptian government signed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt , as well as the Arab world . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information stay tuned - despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution in the Arab world , so it was never so important as it was so difficult , to overcome the blocking of freedom and human rights in the Arab world . even if it was never so difficult to overcome these goals , so it was never so important as yet . we hope to fulfill our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cen@@ sored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , arab@@ ic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ related network of Al Jazeera for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ ni@@ sts and Human Rights Council , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles that he writes in Egypt non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , whom he raised to b@@ ypass the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ ion of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; Blo@@ gger , which is home to Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former journalist journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he recorded physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are primarily turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in an Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed its blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; however , the blogs to un@@ lock is very old , however , in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , it is for me for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It is managed to give me the sense of an ins@@ ens@@ ation to me ; An arrest , seeking murder , pre@@ load in the national Security Council , the sperm blogs , as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words : my words have influence as well as on a small audience .
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it for items from articles to handle the c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; however , after they have locked him and they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mud go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this covers technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vod@@ af@@ one and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented the blocking of providers , which was possible through the conversion of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we realized how to offer the blocking of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s . &quot;
such practice indicates the intention of blocking the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users .
&quot; in addition , the situation will be conce@@ aled that the ens@@ ur@@ ger decisions can be made behind closed doors , making the Egyptian population no legal basis , with which they can proceed to judgment against this actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants are fighting .

&quot; day for day newspapers in Brazil with no@@ zzle headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard designs . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old killed in school &quot; &quot; Je@@ den &apos;s Second Day is murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be smo@@ ker &apos;s pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President T@@ emer sends 8500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Ti@@ af@@ ee according to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis , in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ sion@@ ed financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports like these are all daily and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the manager of a local paper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16 August the Editorial &quot; This is not normal , &quot; in which they announced that a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes reported in any major city on the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual violence , etc . everything , however , will happen in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oct@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Chief Editor , declared that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper around the world , with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper says that it will be controlled by the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas that will be controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoot , and then ask questions to disgu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and combat against corruption at the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; do more than they use it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed against the violence as &quot; &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is to be a justi@@ fication of the failed security policy by the media , and could make it difficult to draw responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - such as extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ adequate investment in personnel , education , and historical and self @-@ pleasing dist@@ ortion of public service . &quot;
&quot; reminder : the Rio de Janeiro state is greater than its capital .

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 @-@ violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
no such cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the dawn per state , Rio is up to No.@@ 16 , she writes . &quot;

&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the state of the State of Rio in 2003 , was one of the government &apos;s aim to conquer a Fav@@ ela &apos;s massive police station and station@@ ed a unit permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . for a few years , the U@@ PP had to be protected after several reports about Sch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor municipalities that the newly created police unit should be protected . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his article published in 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio did not comply with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for humans . &quot;
&quot; for this requires the state to use , means and ways to use the typical for a war . this is one of the int@@ ru@@ sion into the territory of a &quot; enemy &quot; which is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape , and an object for &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; blin@@ ded balls . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or her fact , fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio are still suffering . &quot;
one week it is now that the police captured the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho er@@ kl@@ om@@ m to betra@@ y the death of a polic@@ emen .

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a common initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ lib in a state of siege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons caused by hundreds of civilians on August 21 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition , are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other Human Rights organizations that the massacres of the Assad regime was committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these fighters have been controlled by the rebels outside Damascus under siege , resulting in local authorities or by tun@@ nels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years long block@@ ade , traditional food products like meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ act , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and acade@@ m@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ t@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ nearby and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional , planted in Syria and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . their foods makes it an attractive food source for many residents of besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , plan Nabil , said opposite the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of fung@@ us because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that had been fighting for three years now and pushed his relief from that it is now more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , you use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to mediate 125 families knowledge of pilgrims of pilgrims , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
the initiative is based on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel scar@@ city , locally manufactured fuel are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production of regions from the regions &quot; fung@@ al &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; lec@@ tures@@ que for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have taken mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta free of charge . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila declared that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ us of various reasons &quot; : break@@ age of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; distribution of a culture of self @-@ supply , by eating remains ( such as paper , tea , coffee , box , etc ) are used for extraction new food . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and the siege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to help people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for victims of fires in 2017
several hundred people protest@@ ing on 21 October in many district capit@@ als in Portugal and demanded justice for victims of fires that were in the north of Portugal .
&quot; two and forty @-@ two people died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government &apos;s last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ fighters in the northern and central regions of the country , around 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached . &quot;
&quot; in June he took a similar tragedy in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos , alone in Portugal around 500,000 acres of forest are burned alone - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture from the Ernst of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all Portugal is burning in the true sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures to allow better insights into the properties :
the se@@ eable tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked why the civil protection was not able to make the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al of the Con@@ federation of the farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
they did this Sunday nowhere : there are dozens of articles from open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy like in June could happen again , because the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , construction permits in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ ages are deposited with high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government after severe fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was elected by the municipalities that saw new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , if the applicant had a means of means for self @-@ protection - that was an open rear door , so that JoÃ£o Sor@@ val is going to be built in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Quer@@ cus made it att@@ enti@@ vely that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees made from slightly com@@ bu@@ stible wood , as in a Teu@@ fel@@ um , according to fires of this type . &quot;
&quot; this problems occurs that the website of the Civil Protection of Portugal , on 15th and 16th October , sought for information or attempted to contact persons . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : it used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and inform@@ s the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was founded in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the Fire Brigade , and that the servers of the 400,000 users who followed the fires did not stand , the site counted more than half a million . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; during a night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan started through the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din group , which had defeated short @-@ lasting pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; exactly at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , joined the Province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghan in the last time with his family . &quot;
&quot; even though his mother didn &apos;t say so , she didn &apos;t know that she would not see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning gray , the boy should break up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Masters of Haz@@ ara , dominated by the Taliban , had just been murdered by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara felt suddenly protection . &quot;
they were always closer to their hatred for the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban .
many Haz@@ ara left the land towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself back in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a co@@ hab@@ itation . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left from his low wage , and went to Iran . once again he was in an alien country with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , which we also worked . &quot;
&quot; there was no services there and no heating . we hanged n@@ ylon before the open windows , so that we do not tum@@ ours night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af sent his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wreck and stran@@ ded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , left alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice a day food . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for the asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is also true that conditions that are asylum seek@@ ers in the country , cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of the asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special entrance centers . &quot; this is an improvis@@ ing facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a recording center if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; to then there are people who have no money for a accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unexpected li@@ fel@@ ess helped A@@ shar@@ af to free themselves out of these conditions .
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af made his total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this was so good that he opened a second hostel after a while .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Dis@@ cover Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( german : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureau@@ cracy , high taxes , and conditions for loans are just some of obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans operated companies , including tail@@ or , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience in which the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts to Italy &apos;s history . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims are enough to go beyond the Italian restaurants of food and retail trade , and aim to go back to the country that he forced forced to leave as teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af , with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happy , if I know that my people suffers . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s poorest provinces , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and need to get the same options as all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af en@@ cir@@ cled plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can sell packaging and preserv@@ ative techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of successful entrepreneurs was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he also wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament exam@@ ines a bill of bill , which sees users social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government authority . &quot;
&quot; users would have to use to use social networks within six months , within six months of the authority of the authority , and register their complete name , as well as their reference number . &quot;
&quot; he who missed this step , may be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the end of a criminal charge . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of par@@ liam@@ ents , is currently under the processing of the Parliament as well as the constitutional Committee of Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another deputy proposed a legislative proposal to be introduced in the tough@@ er pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the siege of the President and government facilities are already stra@@ it@@ ably . under the bill of law , a such act would act with prison - and fin@@ es , so right wing of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law should be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the convicted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would under@@ go a political climate , in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of freedom has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ moud subscription Z@@ id ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) on 13 August 2013 , when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen , which had demonstrated violence against the military coup that had led to the president of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as much as 700 protest@@ ors who had been arrested for the same incident four years in prison on a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th May , because the prison line failed according to human rights groups , accused the def@@ endants of the prison in the court . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty on a basis , so many human rights groups were lon@@ ely , head@@ load exposure of inter @-@ arms , illeg@@ ally Assembly , murder and an attempt of murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza spoke the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage to a pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
&quot; the Court also reduced the sentence of journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident of 25 years . &quot;
Tunis@@ ian activists listen to perme@@ able documents
&quot; in May , Tunis@@ ian authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was interro@@ gated primarily by the President of the Republic , according to the plan expressly concluded a controversial legislation , according to the plan and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali accused of corruption , provided that all un@@ lawful funds will return . &quot;
&quot; the document issued on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light on how the prehistoric plans look like to support the legisl@@ ature order . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the nam@@ ing of its sources under article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press co@@ de@@ xes , which journalists have the right to protect their sources . &quot;
nevertheless he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness .
will China require the users of social media to submit their identity ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the National Council of People &apos;s Republic of China , users need social media in China to write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in the provisions , it is also stated that regi@@ stering with the full re@@ els will be required . &quot;
&quot; analysts are immune to the elim@@ ination of anonymous comments in entertainment within the social networks . it is un@@ clear until now , how the authorities will apply these regulations . &quot;
&quot; Chinese networks proposed in the social media , these regulations are only sel@@ ective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
&quot; then , we see in &quot; &quot; we@@ chat &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship of Russia stopped access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging App We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , White Chat , to register with the state government as &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to the Russian government a list of online services leads to the &quot; publication of information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to make use of contents for removing contents and force them on request to compens@@ ate user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently part of websites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ ver@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;

&quot; the Turkish Ministry for Transport , maritime Affairs and Communication was closed because it became &quot; &quot; an information source , which combined with groups to join a political diff@@ user campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is fully blocked , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
&quot; great Britain cannot stop , her@@ ring &quot;
&quot; following this week , Britain &apos;s British government is located in the middle of a targeted consultation provider that would force Internet service providers to monitor communication services in real time and to monitor un@@ locking devices , de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
