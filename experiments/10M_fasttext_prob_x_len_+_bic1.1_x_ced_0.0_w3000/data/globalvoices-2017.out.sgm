<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"how many of my generation I grew up with American films, I've picked up American music, American authors and run his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14-year-old I saw the grand Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, who covered the Supreme Court of an oil painting with the help of Julia Roberts, who were over his interest, wanted to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only strengthened."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" "America is the only country where I ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming that you are always who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equality."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very weak love story about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about the tourism and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as it comes with his bottled power."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, like a former colleague, and declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afroamerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won with the Republican elections, was the highest number that ever reached by the party nominate candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">"I could not met Trump and his voters in harmony with people, which I met during my time in Phoenix."</seg>
<seg id="22">"like for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, people out of all over the world, a deep glacific person, with whom I managed to talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps worldview does not agree with Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to generosity, which I experienced in Sandy Bahr who fought for their lives in the environment and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it still fits to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with much patience and suffering, and my colleagues helped us to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise Council has helped me much in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodies through them embodies my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump turned his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the equivalent of his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or maybe even because of its contempt of non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the argument with the idea that people have voted for trump, because they were either by his racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call Trump-voters as a roassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the people, one of my friends, said exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectful and implies an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about hectic changes in their municipalities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which most white are voted for trump, because they want to restore control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to raise a man who look down with regard to those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(m.).: as much as" rejection of the white against all other ethnicities "; word game from white in access to the white and whiplash, as it was a great Van Jones, has exactly what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may always have, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country is elected as his president, twice the son of an Kenyaners, whose story he says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise to and say: to Hell with versatility, freedom of religion and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in the Americas after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in all these I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the human being."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" roared the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do you have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans a place in your America?</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they cried and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if anyone, who is not like you, is a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received an impressive and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't it your America." "36 hours later he was rectiled."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trumps Country, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people, who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks me my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">"that music that is played at both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a few years now, the La Banda de MÃºsica (Musikbande) has been playing in the municipality: one of the children and adult existing symphony orchestra, which has been found with their musical instruments an opportunity to overcome her poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students have become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the church, located in one of the poorest provinces Mexican, is known for her drugs abuse and the banana-violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">"however, this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project, and the youth had always offered a rare hopes."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their obligations towards the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI believes:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch, they run through the dusty roads to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you are always laughing and with shining eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, Bongos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located practically on the largest garbage dump of Asuncion in the capital city - on instruments which are made of recurring waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with restored instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling of Favio ChÃ¡vez started making parts of the case in instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments impose violins, viola, belli, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion that were all made from garbage."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez reminds himself of local ecology and music teacher of the children of Cateura, at the beginning time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach in the same place, the kids did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents, because many of them do not live with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">"this changed when Favio was shown somewhat, which he never saw before: one made of waste."</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments from re-prepared material and called the Recycled Orchestra."</seg>

<seg id="100">"in West Africa, this ship was known that this ship had already been in illegal fishing waters before it was seeking the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were displeased this over the accordingly, and slightly inclined, to be called an arousy of this kind in their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Commentors, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized rapidly against the ship. they refused to share one of their ports and refused to share a fishing law."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" suddenly the Premier was surrounded by countries that all of you refused to do everything "," Benedict Kiilu, a leading employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship and persecuted. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not succeeded to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishery)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are six countries driven by the Premier of their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "thus, we have eight countries that are simultaneous and working together. they exchange information from and stand each other in where it goes illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden, absent because of it extremely difficult. thus, the illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the intentional disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are being protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems may have damage, which have a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, during action against illegal fishing once caused by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-empo, the actions in real-time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can exchanging the lists of existing licenses, news to suspect activities or details that you noticed during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very carefully when moving these on the open sea by satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to identify ships, which fish in banned areas. also, such as suspicious roadways can discover that a ship invites its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved ships have a fish licence where they were on the way and possibly even if they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing companies may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports, which means that ships could not sell their charge. and that they could not be forced to sell their charge, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owners, meaning that the illegal fishing is financially worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that's what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a celebrity dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain a total of 20 million USD in lost turnover, which will lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen that penetrate in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has become one of the most productive tuna fishing plants for the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these are also illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"other practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, counterfeit license papers, indication of Phantasenames, the fishing protected species and the fish in nature areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they take advantage of the lack of international co-operation and make the weaknesses of a non-mosquito control system", "says Long." "it was a ship illegally fishing and a country could say 'You have not allowed my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and precisely this legal slip hole tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front works so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i was involved in more than 30 studies of suspected Ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"there has been criminal networks uncovered, who had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. there were ships who used several fraudulent identities and has found volatile ships and found it."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crimes, FISH-i can share information about illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far to the networks of organisational crimes, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that should help FISH-i, suspicious ships more precise."</seg>

<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, helps maintain Illegal Ships to hide the illegal ships."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" Duncan Copeland, Head analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO who also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships can switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps to build a system that connects different information network. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with larger precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">"but, FISH-i's Team African Nations can actually influence influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?"</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch together with Google and the Maritime organization Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide with the position of each traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "entun with the neighbours to get a better picture of it, who does it - that makes sense," "he says." "here's a chance for countries to unite and join their resources to the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system uses persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are evidence that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but they also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which previously fished without a license and hardly have consequences to count, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i participated in a 33% increase in fisheries, since then fishing boats will buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped Greko 1, the inspectors took place on board Schleppnets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>

<seg id="147">"other countries have noticed these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are going to disappear several hundred million dollars annually by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined together for the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH." "with safety, the aim is to have more such initiatives and structures will also arise in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia was able to report his first major triumph in October: in October it was a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only the ship was on the way without a license and were not only forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was even in forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the letter of dimensional rules against Greko 1, they put a strong sign that they go against illegal fishing." "Bergh says."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence shows that such special, collaborative work for the protection of the oceans actually works throughout the world sea.

<seg id="351">"the error was to interpret Julian Holmes, a population of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The conservative daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote in the Kyoto Protocol:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>

<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the name" "Drivers" "(German:" fearful drivers ") was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite the correct name" Elder Drivers "(german:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto Prefecture was responsible for translation errors. furthermore, they explained that the error was already contained in the text that they had been tested by translators, and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published."</seg>

<seg id="359">"we really sorry that older people felt by inadequate correction (the translation) on our part," said the police. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News sat up with the phenomenon of "fearful" older drivers in Japan apart and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" terrible "was denounced as an appropriate description of elderly drivers. according to the police, the proportion of elderly drivers who are involved in accidents are involved in accidents."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19.460 accidents were caused by senior citizens. this represents a share of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of transmission ratios are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for example, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transmit him into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires an active control of the target language - something that is in the case of breast language. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the initial language - parent language should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">A French native language should translate into English for example from English into French - not from the French to English.</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as mother tongue, which could produce translations into English. this may be a lack of understanding for the overset, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers that Japanese will be attributed to Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies who have no foreign employees, do not allow translations to grow internally. then, the Japanese employees, whose English knowledge is the best to be considered, no matter how good or bad his language knowledge really are."</seg>

<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrene and rattle phrases that are created by machine translation, show that this technique can not replace a long human translators for a long time. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulation in Japan, among them also the rattle prints that are often used T-shirts or pockets, are not used to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be still acceptable or at least harmless. but by big companies or from the government, which have funds to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentary elections recently submitted a bill to "Regulations concerning the instructions and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is adopted by Parliament, users and users will need to register social media in Egypt at a government agency to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a job would then be set up, which is instructed to share citizens and citizens to share social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, user experience and users would have to register with their right name and identity numbers, to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it be failed to do this, then it could bring a penalty of up to six months" imprisonment or purging. "</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" jedwede application that runs on the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice, video files and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is passed when it is accepted, as the draft may not be imposed on how Egyptian authorities can not register the user inside and users of the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register in the situation that the Egyptian government is not able to guarantee the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, parliamentary and promoter of the legal situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a user name and password" to get through the firewall to get the Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt is planning to build a firewall on national level around Facebook. due to those, it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians need to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>

<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that the same as they could have nonviolent public and private spaces that could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take it seriously, then it means that they may apply a strong surveillance system to apply citizens or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people, and to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically no real realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed under the Legislative Assembly and the Constitutional Committees before it goes into the plenary debate."</seg>

<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring regions of Fukushima and Iwate have been evacuated; because the tsunami had vanished all the coastal towns of the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"furthermore, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo report shows the advances six years after the advances in order to rebuild the life of local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding agency as well as the survey results of the affected itself.</seg>

<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare parts (for the house of the house, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to list the largest success among the three preprefectures, 80 per cent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has finished 75 percent of such houses, while the Fukushima share the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"in fact, six years after the disaster, evacuated by the catastrophe, evacuated by Behetsu juutaku) moved to final spare buildings."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in the accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas at Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated workers were hauled after the disaster in the accommodation."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the number is at 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The stand of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools, who were affected by the misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which makes almost 98 percent of the schools of three prefences."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefings are far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing ports have been reproduced in Fukushima."</seg>

<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmlands in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the arable land in Fukushima can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that only a consequence of the atomic fact is, because only 690 hectares of 5 hectares are destroyed in the fields of Fukushima, lying in the nuclear state of nuclear zone."</seg>

<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had been evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its issue on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has intensified its attention to the situation of the evacuated from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had not only had to experience the massive earthquakes and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic accident, nuclear power, had to join the Japan."</seg>
<seg id="578">"out of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were placed in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, some more than 23 000 people were transferred back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the state of 2017, there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their homeland prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophes, most of the evacuated workers are still missing in Behelfshausen, older than 50 years old. they are able to rejuvenate the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. this is the building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will be held in Tokyo in 2020."</seg>

<seg id="782">"sometimes I have the feeling, as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect to the person who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be equally valid or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes further:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he is great. and it is not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic "offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, this is what would they have lost those who have lost someone and those who have fear, that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to blot numbers in a statistic will be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the crime of people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students will be justified in a neighbor, so that they were up."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to talk to themselves, that they remain unpunished by such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" Four months Erpressance in the main city district, "like a family with threats of threats from their business, until they did not only destroy the business, but also their family apart."</seg>

<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the contribution" The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, "a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexicos?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of her."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a Waise and he tells that he had to teach himself how to make a egg cook, potatoes crumble, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies that dwell with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">"however, they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live."</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, one told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ends.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was already past two years ago, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, the bloody suffering of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, as a violence by the organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the State Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to the average 8.5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of thousands of thousands who organized the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories live in view of the headlines, but this project reminds us of those who are not forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata in 2015, whose aim is to provide complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking in the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="1207">Perhaps there was none of Bassels cultural prototypes expected as the work that he started working with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the wayside of numerous civilians and merging the Greek-Roman architectural types with hiesky traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"then, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would like to put everything about it, this architecture that is not only embodied the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known societal network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to humans East Indian origin or generally used as adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" Kalar "or the" "Calar" "(in burial writing) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of the hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given an extremely abnormative connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"'Kalar' may usually be associated with racism, but the word in itself calls not automatically hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that, in which they discussed the use of the word or doubts about the use of the word, have been censored."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with basic different meanings, which have the same bookkeeping as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing' which contains the same letter as well as other words such as' Kalar pae '(Spage bse),' Kalar Oat '(Kamel) or' kalarkaar '(curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaung explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar':</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends on spiritual kind, whether they knew how he could use his back pain when he made a vocabulary."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the sentence ku la -" healing "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in win Hin Win Hail is the opinion that it becomes a radical nationalist, but also emphasized that Facebook analyzer had to be able to spread Facebook before all the posts to spread racism in the suspicion of racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Facebook does not delete the word" Kalar, "manually."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you write on Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"instead, what to do instead is to analyse the post carefully and check it by using the next words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (Spage bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these three nationalists who hate speech, will receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it's time to circumcise its nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the promotion may send a strong signal to everyone who hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not hold long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of percussion often have a catch- and mouse game, whereby users to use social networks simply to use a new word or alternative writing of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung described how Facebook began to extinguish his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new Directive of Facebook, I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and told me the liken, post and parts of content for 24 hours, because the post" "Facebook Community Standards" was unanswered. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a multitude of people removed from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech by Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author divided his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should do more about the beginning of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community will ask counsel:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a well-willing intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">There will only be more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if it began to have this without local context or technical support and have banned as words such as" chair "or" Erbcurry "." "</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they did not have mistakes, they tried not to recise the dissoldered posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they have only a little bit of respect for the 15 million benefits, which gave them a great turnover, would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has ensured for a lot of spoiling among users.</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which is in 13 Indian states, he is part of the # Khelbadal campaign, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and sets up for degradation of the patriarchate."</seg>

<seg id="1480">It reports how this club created a safe place for these women and made them at the same time at the bottom of the wall.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion round, acted by women who did not call their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">"she opted for this topic, because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem, which the women can easily identify themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to discuss the names of their husbands, a Brush who pleaded not guilty, and never questioned them in question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not enter this, is considered to be considered as a woman without moral."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"the tradition is so deeply rooted, that we have never made a thought about this discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband before, had never called her name at home, as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-mother and my husband weigh still long after the video was at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me, and said, I should call him from now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started their first discussion lub."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "nor ever before. some believed that it meant a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to bring the discussion with a practice in gear."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with various feelings - happy, annoyed, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked them all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want us to respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the break of a centuries-old tradition, in whom married women to the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she had happened during the whole exercise, but another decided to release all the congested frustration against him and his family, taking him cursed."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in fact, in the area of Adrenalinct, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call her husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Rohini received a variety of reports in the next few days.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas put them in his head: his wife could not stop to say his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it with dinner before the entire family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she appealed, she was afraid, and said that it was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women tried to stop other practices, such as the traverse of the interest in the forehead, which shows the troubleman:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the zinnoberred dot, if it was also."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only, and I listened to him to bear him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"other women have not stopped completely, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose itself, not to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion sklub is a safer place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we do a trip with every discussion sklub.</seg>
<seg id="1520">"normally, we pack lunch and water and go out into the field."</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to take care of the women who could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang, and talked about things that they had never done before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on this problems for so many years and yet, I also have some things, for example like our identities to our husbands, never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, certain things to say loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we have talking about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a vast shirt of a pants, wear it not."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of the own wardrobe, morals are connected to the Saris and much more, dirty Rohini's own pair of Kurtas (Upper hemden) into a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they now have decided to plan a trip to Goa while they can wear Jeans and Rohini is sure to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question, whether in the five months since their first discussion-lub already changed, Rohini confirms that things are slowly entering the rolls:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have made only little steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then we stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, not included, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are included."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two still say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"the women in discussion sklub know that the changes that they want to reach in their lives - like the foot for more movement, or their own wardrobe - at the end of a hard to navigate the river."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"being aware of each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"but this club, each of us, gives us confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home in the club and other people, what we are talking about and what we do."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from marginalised groups in India, making videos about stories about which it is not reported."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question seems stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the conference on a meeting of the International branch of the State of the State of New York, the ministers noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... nobody has asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"it is, with most people commit a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accuses the Minister of Justice to twist logic," to defend logic in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercising of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificed, to create this valuable country, we hear that we should not be any country at the end."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had a escape before the responsibilities, a mandatory injury."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he appeared inconspicably less democratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"however, in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally towns that are led permanently from a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the focal point of the subject, the good old lyre of the authoritarian seizards come back to the present Democrats, the twisted logic, because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, in the final week of Shanmugam were given answers to its American guests regarding our press, our youth ative, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Appropriate questions wasted with non-answers rational type.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls Shanmugam to illustrate his opinion, because they didn't understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is to which country is owned by..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our werter K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point, if it became high, to be part of the government of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment posted on the reviews that it should begin to read the entire story of the conference to understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "to be considered a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore would be so uneasier, even if we are free and righteous choices."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He joined Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw decades a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" wasn't a country, "he obviously does not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam who makes a leader of a heralable generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am over what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said,..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yev and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - was I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is what he defended."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review sets the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr Shanmugam "committed a mistake" or was it a Freudscher speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we will only be considered an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique and it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role in the government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of severe importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do they afford a military service, but they defend their own city, but not their own country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our prime bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink personnel?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to spring, Singapore is always a town:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to be scandalized many of the people...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, especially, etc., but that's not quite true. "</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked me in Japan is: "are you American?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I am sorry, and answer me." I come from Canada. "since 1994 I live and again in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation, the conversation takes place, it is regarded as polite to show interest in his conversation with personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"usually the standard answer follows:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians may cook inwardly before anger when they are kept for Americans, but I don't bothered me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little who distinguishes the Canadian of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well to their backpack, when they are travelling."</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">"Americans, however,...."</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the march of Iraq and September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "excuse."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the tolerant country opposite ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamps "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, as" nice "means to be called, is basically to be skinely, as the benevolent, gentle, but tragically unimportant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(which has its own Canadian doubles)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders would be a step forward. but the actual problem exists that "nice" does not have personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing that can hit."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Harmless to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and no attention to deserve.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be something good when you wish to remain unnoticed in the background, fernab of the things that pass around."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go so far, to say that the wish is free and to be alone, a major member of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outdoor" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence using the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we are missing the warm, open kindness, which I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican town of Tapachula he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a corps and gold tones and gold coloured earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many of the name Mom Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a goal for Africans and Haitians who are in transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel rather has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the entrance there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but hundreds of African and haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. RamÃ­rez tells the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast to call it:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present, RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time in this year."</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms and some have already slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She wants to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she helps them also, and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay them, they massive them with a balm from the long journey."</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>

<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans that are on the way to the United States to make normal first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other directions from Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells that the Haitians and Africans often go together the way, that Africans speak to WhatsApp by Ms. RamÃ­rez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his guide, Michelet has lived in Brazil and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest at Mom Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money, to buy the Bustuet to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will contact Mrs. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"mom Africa is our Mother and we never leave them again," "he answered smiling." we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. RamÃ­rez tells that her guests are often sending text messages when they have continued to grasp her, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps well known here, but it is not the only sparken hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a sackgasse leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"in this winter, Valenzuela and his family moved to migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is Policist and has found that the Bustuets are sold to many African migrants too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to receive a reasonable price, then he offered them his home for one dollar."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help others. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he moved out after a raid on his working place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children before people who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>

<seg id="1961">"the residents of Xinjiang, a ethnic minority region in China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in Tianshan District of the city of Urumqi received a mobile notification that it shows the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, the app will be said that the app will get access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had been installed shortly after they had installed the app, messages with a private wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the notification of the police, the app would determine the sources and the distribution routes of terrorists and track, together with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, ebooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the block pornographic websites, from online fraud, Trojan and Phishing pages to make users interested, how much time they spend online, and remote control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filters for minors shall help children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"of course, an app with these functions can be used naturally in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "or even hackers could be able to manipulate home network of a person or steal it from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while news about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, the reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme interest and surveillance measures as well as routineming internet connections."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"based on Twitter-based media outlet" images from Mainland China "(with the bbons of the bailer), the censored news in China showed photos of a checpoint, on which policemen were indiscriminately checked, whether they were installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinian ensure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected on a checpoint with a device without these software, they could be imprisoned up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for the technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"you have compelled the people to use devices who are intended for older people, to use."</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" "(for the next-house of the bbons), also published a Jingwang product description, which means that the software can raise the license requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang are too electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government officials, authorities and with the party related facilities including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions of Cybersecurity office during operation of their computer and communications equipment."</seg>

<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked whether the investigator had worked as a garbage, or if it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables in one another, to present us, out of their sight, great invention of a giant cabels."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"three of them occur within one hour, while I was still in the series."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and my voice, which I heard."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the Henker noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in it, so that he was next to an electrically charged staff."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity permeates my whole body, enough to supply my whole neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-nucleated body, stretched out on the ground, was the perfect electricity head."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was there again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">"after two terrible hours, he decided that he had fulfilled his duty to this night."</seg>
<seg id="2080">That must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep myself again; let's say that this was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">Some hours passed that came to me like minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning bet.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light meets the room" "Raus with you, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I reply with the voice of an exhaustive youth," "My lord, my father has to worry about."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they were always free.</seg>
<seg id="2089">Where do they lead me?!</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib puts the most of his time inside; sometimes it is to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but on what you can leave, a cigarette between his fingers, or with nicotine defiled her lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top of his family house, which had been part of the West Bank since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine, where they had lived as felahyeen (about: farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, which is transferred to the conservative majority, and their altproven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression of expression through art and rapesmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, often opposed to topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian poultry, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only found in his hometown of Amman Relevance, but also in cities that are in Yemen from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not affected in his thinking through limits, and he can feel the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if it is not open, he puts a special abnormality against US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war areas - even if he was born in Jordan as he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own living conditions," Hdaib emphasises. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a person, while in water solest nest-cafe in two cups. it is the Holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee has to do little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the gap of loud coffee and the scissors of the Kent cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes, Jordan feels like a prison under the free sky, especially if you throws a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is avoidable to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to land not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Minister Jordanians had to be cancelled at the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some Parliament ordered to support the Islamic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontier Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert table is."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the members of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN says that the concert" was cancelled "because of sexual orientation of the prison."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that commitment of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world may be more dangerous activism, which represents the ancient legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian nation as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to use for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not easy to be used rhetoric, but indeed a distinct crystallizing reality in Jordan was clearly reflected in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib traditional gender norms in the body, made his vision of the fate of Arab women, have voiced sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of a evidenced unknown woman, whose arms and legs are tracks up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who have actually trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past years, the number of" Honmorde 'has risen in Jordan - the inofficial outside. "</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary moral reached its peak in 2016; however, Jordan is still missing that Jordan has become the institutional infrastructure to support victims of murder or domestic violence to support appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law governing law in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of non-family violence," and for their release, often a lonely bureaucratic effort, and the guarantee of the family is necessary that the woman will not happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well known for this, even not before topics to revert in his country long as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, dreaming that he is not able to separate his music that is full of explicit assumptions on sexuality, freedom and expression of expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"he became politics in me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called 'Edward Sa' ed, Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb" focus on poverty in turn.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of the songs, which are politically, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, a verse is repeated often:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the songs Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can get what you want" - be faith or nonbelieve, Hetero- or homosexuality. "</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly any one speaks in Jordan about the rights of gay and reading, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored until 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from the context, revolves and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but it was only a worked version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is open to the Arab LGBTQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals do not disagree to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nues, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in memory today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nudas, who later should work on behalf of the Caliph later, could write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians do that?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on the free expression of expression and that progressive voices shall be put into silence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took a number of former government members and members of the teaching position, with the grounds that they had expressed themselves on comments in social media, with which deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is, according to the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to work out a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a permanent gene and take away. Jordan has left Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - it is sure that these changes from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society will take place."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, also dreams of an Arab world without interventions abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he doesn't dream about it, his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience her."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is inspired by music, art and literature of a genuine and basic openness - and not through bombs, streumerable and to artificial democracy. at least, he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is done, Hdaib will continue to dedolls and also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, to which Aman listens to a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2150">These big and extravagant wardolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one thought that it is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually over a variant of the Tanabata Festival. another theory states that the arrest, the drums, and dancing over a thousand years, have been invaded and from a time to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, Emishi in the knee."</seg>

<seg id="2181">The following article is the revised version of the Beitrags "Principles of guerrilla fighters that has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The post will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who feel stretched out, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"exactly this question went the two young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga by the Foundation Bogotos and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired them to write the campaign cartas por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), the young people encouraged to write guerrilla letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country was a scene of a historical event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">The subject of peace agreement was considered so important that the Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his services.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of the Colombia, however, it is still a long way until you can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"Guerrilla fighters, who lived for many years in illegal camps, were exposed to a war rhetoric and around the clock their weapons will have to be put into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian company, in turn, who had used to live in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, this has to take place in their ranks, and support them in the building of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombia had to close together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And exactly that they did: until now already thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, which are then personally handed over."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as a inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation of reconciliation emerged at the World Summit of Peace Laureate who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there were Leonardo and Cristian's opportunity to speak soon with Kailash Satyarthi who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people who love to write thousands of love letters, but those forgotten they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told us further to share his love with people who needed most urgent promise in this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former militants of the FARC." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the context of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Colombia as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I have never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were passed on 19 March in one of the UN camp in the Caldono-Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from Javeriana University in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the foundation of BogotArt in the camp to get the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC arose so, as they had done it earlier to receive the commands of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of subsation of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's unbelievable how many different feelings you can run in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies between, "" told the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter took me by the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla man who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him there was a MGL-pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I answered him, and asked," Hello, what do they do? "he answered," I reply to a letter which someone has written to me. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life, someone has something so beautiful, that is why I answer it." I suddenly heard the tears of the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I embraced him, and set me beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this cap, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had something else from life than war. in the FARC, the only way to keep it and his six brothers before the Hungertod." "I have never thought that someone would be forgiven me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know there is a society outside there, who waits with open arms to us."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace is there, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start, students and some leader of the FARC came together in a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grew up as early as war and the FARC was already in the borrow.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leader of the FARC declared the story of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years we experienced how the opportunity to develop us to a political party, we can help to design the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"these people, who have never been heard and had no voting rights, and to know that people who have often seen as a monster, and they even hate people with beautiful feelings, who were surrounded by their lifestyle and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me, that all men - even those who have killed and so much harm have caused us to bring us something and a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"for example, Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote as DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the Archbishop of the City of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">"in Colombia, Colombia was prophesied that after deforestation of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are willing to raise the weapons and to protest for their rights. and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all the defenders of peace, no matter what race, religion or ideology - to all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, afford our contribution, and bring sacrifices, because we know from their own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend the life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are coming."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2254">"from fear for her life, she moved to the United States last end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was working as a volunteer in human rights organisation.</seg>

<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the round by Whatsapp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>

<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world, not only your family, but the whole republic is disappointed. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay down a snare around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, there was a car with a dark window discs and a number plate with a number of 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time it was happening, I was clear that there was a little lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights-friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to give their names, but I don't want to remember them all. they really have helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something unbelief."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still understand how it could.</seg>
<seg id="2302">"just before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother, once I arrived."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without register without ID, without identification."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card in my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe in safety, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">People know already in which hotel you are plugged. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you still stand in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"some traditional Caucasian elements, I still bear in myself."</seg>
<seg id="2317">So much I wish you can't overcome this seelic barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say always, that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give a lot of effort to look like the person from their past - so on my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For whom I needed current information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked with someone who had a one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan, he was arrested and tortured, but also, that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are now even gay men detained in these secret places?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or have dropped from their relatives to present Kadyrows court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they may present themselves later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, you will show their bodies in television and claim they had attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"however, these people wouldn't just have disappeared but targeted to radicalize themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a delay or have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just wanted someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people had disappeared in this prison, after their beard was grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new of them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply have taken away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was even when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there were still no reports until now. we discouraged that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not be allowed to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these pursues and disappearances of people, who had a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already found in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair for ever.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known in Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the Scharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much more secure than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" civilian "," but ultimately he finally thrown back into the stone time. "</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were cut off, and I had coloured lashes, bore a tube, and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defence of Scharia has never shot me a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met with me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and all the town knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a Redeemer: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spell not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, when they make more than sick people."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulting me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this mercy time mean?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow entered the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about moral."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had landed before and landed, consider yourself with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic steadily sacked."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go to?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitch.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn a lot of $700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"in addition, I still worked as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I testimonials with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teacies, meetings, I send them to the hospital and help them to get eating cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't want to pay a long penny.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I abstained a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so, nature, that's purely nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to do with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no tails with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have Kabardiner, who also have Russians, but there are they that are on all the planet, but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from Caucasus Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims go into the mosque and fasten during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experience. but that's a truce."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation to be exact, different living settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and do not harm me for my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: there were all family fathers, who felt and unable to feed their families because of persecution by the Iranian government, helpless and unable to feed their families."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty and unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where a large part of the Arab ancestor community is based in Iran, was severely affected by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult to deny its living conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"in a century ago, Arabian Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power over and 1925 major efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion, written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website of AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as an intersectoral feminists - with Frust."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought-out scientific and social arguments from me why I should be feminist and why we generally should be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women nowadays still earn less money at the same time as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under stringent observation, when it comes to what they can do with their bodies."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women have sooner or later in various areas of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination are still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I am talking to skin color, on Black Cis-women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; if I promise to mention both white feminists and white intersectionals, many white feminists and white intersectals were silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to sing" their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing "to get the equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexual violence, there are an institutional form of assisting violence that we are exposed to black women to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or about that black women and women of other ethnicities and adolescents were less earn than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with migrant backgrounds are more often referred to school than white girls because of obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spinal and women with migration background are exposed to higher risk to suffer domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the other hand, I want all the women, all men, and all men, every skin and all men's rights; on the other hand, I cannot consider as a black woman, in whose center the white woman is to take into account that affect both gender as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I'm exhausted and I will not fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented spy, that always and countless other black women and ever rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner accused 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to preserve an ideology in which the black woman is a human and marginalised nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will not try to try white women the importance of exaggerating skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different heart information and to borders of white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself full and completely from feminism, who was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of me for a white feminist paradigm, which is so hard-dirty, that Intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women in our own performances and we go into the spinning, which will be created by us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can help ourselves) that we can defend ourselves on our own way. and not only that - black women can also be revered to them that make us completely safe and even spiritual elements, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and interactive feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of my dark skin because of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" from Kurier. the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# soft-edec) that reports the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police Commissioner Ada BÃ¡ez said that she had nothing against Luis Balbuena, her exouse who had become violent over violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship, some time has passed and the police said, her statement would not be laid, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further woman Balbuena showed for mistreatment, also the acute indication of Ada BÃ¡ez has never used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back."</seg>
<seg id="2486">"to break the devil in violence against women, it is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are ever refund at all, they generally receive support from the Staats."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of women who admit to be victims of violence at all."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"attaching 1 strokes and Statistic 2 Unseen Missions and a Legal System, which does not undermmmming the laws: good approach, flawed implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher for genderwonder at Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social research institution in Paraguay." there are various information and reports that will not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">However the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Prosecutor of 9600 ads went to domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5,000 ads for domestic violence at the peace of peace. 86% of the signs of women came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women reported that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi only few of these crimes are actually displayed." on every woman who are not refundable in Paraguay for mental abuse, there are 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"as women's murder in Paraguay is no own offences, the prosecution authority cannot be appropriate as many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The ordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>

<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would have a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read it earlier, I thought that only women had happened to undertake it, because they are deceive of violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, they wrote contributions on Facebook, in which they described his insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, whether he had ever raised the hand against them, and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of mistreatment."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they did so long by Carlos and didn't leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost so, when they wanted to say that victims of abuse were at least a certain fellow to blame."</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been fighting in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredel, the first plant that has been cultivated by NASA astronauts in space and has been consumed."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years of work, Morton's work was placed only by his own income and the question, how many salads can be received, borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not be able to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents have not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past years, more such patents have been applied to more plants like cereals or cartridges. due to this trends provide plantations, environmental protection and experts for food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton still needs a salad, but it is now longer, because his work is still worth more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as would lie in a river a rock, to whom I have to go."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents will go too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before court, no one can breed any new salateries because all the features are already patented." he is doing so good as possible and trying to recover those features, which he wants. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, however, he is very careful and endeavored to use any material which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"in addition, he joined a movement that is becoming bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source of source (" Open Source ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred red tube salat in the" greenhouse "of the station and eaten. there will be tested, whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is not a coincidence that this name sounds rather as it would come from the IT area, and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "Open Source" software to provide alternatives to copyright protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and -gene are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are usable permanently."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, in short Ossi, US breeders can be undergoing to undertake the fact that others can freely use them farmed seed."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they can't continue with their seed, and can sell it." open source "breeders allow others to cross their seed, to cross the own varieties, and it is not immediately banned - two aspects that are banned by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seeds have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for nutrition security and for environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to his seed, seed plays a role in larger combination such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little to use seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg is emphasized that the "open-source" movement is not busy with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, we need control of organic farming or not." "who is good, locally and sustainably productive vegetables, as for example, we need control over the crops, as for example, the way that this vegetables should be bred, threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereign, without seed-sovereign, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensure other their seed still freely available. thus, you are going to patented seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argued that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool because of the most numerous intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, CEO of Ossi, has been engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation at carrots and their availability. she found out that approximately one-third of all cartons are protected as intellectual property, making it either not or only worthy to be used."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, there are no such estimates yet, but experts like Luby missed that massage plants like wheat in even larger style are patented as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Question of Visitors</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are so bred, so they are able to achieve targeted characteristics - from such that their taste or color improves until such, due to which they flourish or threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders increases by increasingly more patents. however, genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before, because the changes in changes through climate change is much worse predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto recognizes that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four genbanks and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States, the company is set up for maintaining the genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, you contradict that the intellectual property of other breeders including" patents and the protection of plant variability innovations "." a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow, as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often this instructions can help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection inhibits innovation, does not support innovation, but promotes the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the different: 20 years to wait until a patent change, and certainly no innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to wait for plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have already lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and there should remain:" independent plant breeders neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to simplify farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what we will feel, and it is impossible to use us if we do not continue to use the best and latest resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton is disturbed in the concept to patented plant features:" we do not create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them, and as breeders we don't have any idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety, are also breeding his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture, with big farms and monocultures, are needed for growing herbiocides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is accurate. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding, or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeders Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden Salates.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders would be innovative by the prevention of plant paterners:" it looks like I have to produce something new, more strongly than companies, the patenting. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I do constantly need new material for my catalog, since I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years ago," "he says." with a patent one is just 20 years ago, wherewith it is easy to make it very nice. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"in fact, the USA seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, but the concept spreads out fast on all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the centre of sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, the center with farmers working together and helps them to breed new varieties to breed certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to get to "open source" seed and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organisation Agrecol is working on an "open source" license which ultimately became a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeders differ from country to country, absent because Ossi's commitment is not simply one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional plants should not be patented. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent, that patents on conventional plants are permitted."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States to put the patent office to implement these new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference to" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, focusing on farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from all East Africa to experience something about the" Open Source "seed movement and global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" Open Source "seed systems that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for which scheduled next year of official starting signal should fall."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, International Nonprofit-Development Organisation USC Canada and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a consortium of aid agencies such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and other - published a report. it represents the opportunity to share and improve the seed policy to ensure that a stable supply of food safety can be ensured."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a diverse, local supply of seed with seed for sustainable food systems is stresses - a connection between the Luby by Ossi, hopes that it will soon be seen more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement of regional and ecological foods has primarily respected, where and how slightly grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we are trying to make people clear that even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2721">Still unlocking the Egyptian authorities in the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend, the Egyptian government signed the website of the" Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights abuses in Egypt, as well as the Arab world. "</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step sharp and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the" Network for Human Rights Information stay tuned - despite this attack and the violation of the Egyptian Law and the Constitution in the Arab world, so it was never so important as it was so difficult, to overcome the blocking of freedom and human rights in the Arab world. even if it was never so difficult to overcome these goals, so it was never so important as yet. we hope to fulfill our task further. "</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, arabic-speaking edition of the Huffington Post and Qatar-related network of Al Jazeera for alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of the columnists and Human Rights Council, Ahmed Gamal Ziada."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnies and articles that he writes in Egypt non-accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, whom he raised to bypass the Zensurion of the Egyptian government, even the goal of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"Blogger, which is home to Ziadas blog, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former journalist journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he recorded physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are primarily turning around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in an Facebook comment, Ziada expressed its blocking by the government and reflecting what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"however, the blogs to unlock is very old, however, in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, it is for me for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It is managed to give me the sense of an insensation to me; An arrest, seeking murder, preload in the national Security Council, the sperm blogs, as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words: my words have influence as well as on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it for items from articles to handle the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mud go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE), Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 websites. this covers technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE documented the blocking of providers, which was possible through the conversion of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we realized how to offer the blocking of websites, the VPNs."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the intention of blocking the government to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation will be concealed that the ensurger decisions can be made behind closed doors, making the Egyptian population no legal basis, with which they can proceed to judgment against this actions."</seg>

<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argued against the violence as" "war". "this is to be a justification of the failed security policy by the media, and could make it difficult to draw responsibility in the police."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the land towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found herself back in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a cohabitation. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left from his low wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in an alien country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars, which were heavier than he himself to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"at that time, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">"there was no services there and no heating. we hanged nylon before the open windows, so that we do not tumours night."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf sent his life without papers in Iran and made herself ready for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"at the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>

<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a recording center if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still go for asylum seekers."</seg>
