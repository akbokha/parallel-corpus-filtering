this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone heard by Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular , that the NSA heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US secret service , in which the CIA was literally sp@@ ared to Iran for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not taste the chapter ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has identified against R@@ isen and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became the symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if the media cannot get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ tigen they will give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government at R@@ isen ank@@ le , he did something that many cour@@ ageous reporter had already done before him : he refused to go and said that he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something exceptional happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were lon@@ ging for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to ra@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in time electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide . &quot;
&quot; instead of failure and can@@ opy to make statements , this could also do his digital footsteps for him . &quot;
&quot; and so , investig@@ ators , without his understanding , concerned his telephone calls , is concerned , &quot;
&quot; like its e @-@ mail data , financial and banana information , its credit card , and even travel insurance with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling , a CIA @-@ w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and cra@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama spoke in his appeal to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary has more condem@@ ns than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how that can be a problem , especially because the government is too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article about national security was the result of that a W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we set the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional atz because the government has always has more possibilities to express all . &quot;
&quot; however , as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can contact them from the moment , in which they contact you rather than in the night , in the witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that had not been written , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal emails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is a Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source program for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer that was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron S@@ wart@@ z , and today has been developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to an news website , like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; you can instantly upload documents or information , as in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot pro@@ cure any more information , and many of the information you would like , would not be available . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments are always developing new spy technologies , which are all endangered . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that not only technology , such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring ini@@ quities . it is equally important that we protect the next w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; the lack of abuse of soldiers are modest , and of over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers , the alarm to contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider , who warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to un@@ cover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that the rich and M@@ ight &#93; have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness to have a statement . &#93; This week we received news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents in Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca
the publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; in fact , we actually see the e @-@ mails , exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already been very direct consequences for the first .
Iceland Prime Minister is re@@ signed .
&quot; also , there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad sent letters in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of $ 2 billion to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait for the next publication , and to the next enth@@ r@@ ations documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it sh@@ es away from you , my ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and mighty in the location are to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ases and not all of their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; in all over the world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens of some few are used to hide their assets and conce@@ als -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appears very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ases work . &quot;
I always make it like a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one company has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I think it &apos;s interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; probably because there were no prominent Americans , which occurred in these revel@@ ations , to this scandal . &quot;
&quot; now it is not so , that there is no rich Americans dealing with their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; we would have a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples see the connections to the United States . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to establish a company than to get a library . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the United States has allowed employees from school districts to cut school children .
&quot; it has been permitted , especially vulnerable to investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself to an African minister , the susp@@ ects money to the US wanted to buy a home , a yacht to buy a private jet . &quot;
&quot; for us , it really sho@@ cked us that all until on a lawyer &apos;s proposals , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all pre@@ ferences . none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nothing was handed over to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
it does not work for a single lawyer showing our hidden investig@@ ators .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single leading pol@@ iti@@ ker , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to handle this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behavior .
&quot; all this may sound very comfor@@ ting , as if we could do anything against it ; as if nothing would have changed , as if it is always the rich and mighty . &quot;
but as born optim@@ ist I don &apos;t see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen some transparency to more transparency , affecting the owners of companies . &quot;
the topic was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at the national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the United States arrived here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , used as funds used to ensure in the US and global for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people who are fur@@ ious , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind p@@ seu@@ dost@@ ems . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it , through laws this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency that allows you to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I have ab@@ duc@@ ted almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made an advance sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep today ? &quot;
&quot; he did the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just didn &apos;t know him ! he says he would not go to peace , but I don &apos;t know if he is really planning . I don &apos;t want to landing in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard me saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Take , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I lay down in bed , I star@@ ed on the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what have I broken ? &quot;
a wild@@ fire sleeping in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such fear that I went out of the bed , turned on ti@@ f@@ tips to the door , and my sleeping door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the work of art that he had purchased from me , is now in his class@@ room . he is a teacher now . &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it has changed my angles completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were , actually , friends who were waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mattress was normal for me , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , be afraid of fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I think we could earn something like that . our apartment will stay in a designer Bed @-@ and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in a wooden floor .
&quot; they found it great , and we too . &quot;
I &apos;m sure to tasted our cheese ham @-@ O@@ mel@@ et completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we opened our last guest , and the door to the castle , Brian and I went on . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent ?
things came in rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented ourselves to investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people publicly posts of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms , whose doors are shut down . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missile would ign@@ ite .
but she did not do .
&quot; no one who is still very comfort , would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned as kids that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you &apos;re talking about the things you can do . we were able to design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just look and ap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create by design immense trust , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust in design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a tasting , which the degree of confidence we dispute . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in hand .
now I want to un@@ lock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ lock mobile phone on your left sitting area .
&quot; this silent flight from panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing that is more than your mobile phone , your home is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can &apos;t just read your SMS , you see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; most guests feel , even if they stay elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
but who has now Al Go@@ res &apos;s cell now ?
&quot; could you tell Twitter , that he is the president of the President ? &quot;
you can return the mobile phones now .
you have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build . I want to tell you of some discover@@ ies .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would only have imag@@ ined with his name ; if he would have told , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 ass@@ ess@@ ments , which all say : &quot; he can really keep very well closed cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ kept feedback system strengthens trust .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to withdraw negative ass@@ ess@@ ments .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted to their ass@@ ess@@ ments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we evaluated how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how they are similar to ages and residence . &quot;
little surprising we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ dat@@ at@@ ess .
&quot; exciting , it will be exciting if you add the call of one person -- in our case by ass@@ ess@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; if you have less than three ass@@ ess@@ ments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation of simil@@ ar@@ ities .
&quot; so , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted pre@@ ferences . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we discovered that trust is dependent on how much you are cheaper . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when you tell me too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; it tells a lot , like for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother , &quot; -- -- if the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , for example &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how to create it with design this degree of op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give advice on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with what we did not reck@@ oned , the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
for us the shop runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times if not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who are un@@ allowed parties to be celebrated or homes devast@@ ated .
hosts have guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front front when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing more than these calls . I just do if I think about it .
&quot; the dis@@ appointment that you hear in the voice of the voice , and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays , only a fraction had a problem . &quot;
because people trust one another .
&quot; if trust works , there can be a miracle . &quot;
one of our guests made holiday in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him into the hospital .
he even sp@@ ends blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real prot@@ agon@@ ists who save life , even though they don &apos;t know any right . &quot;
&quot; they drive a hospital in the hospital , when one dies , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to be lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
&quot; they can even stay longer , without charge the extra @-@ nights . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay runs . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of part with money transactions fit together ?
it &apos;s about an economic trade .
&quot; but it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; lease industry &quot; &quot; will not just be justified . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a portion of themselves open and that changes everything .
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; however , what would be a rich buffet of local objec@@ tions ? &quot;
&quot; what would be if at any place that you visited , a group there would have been waiting to fill a thor@@ ough and fill in one of a bar @-@ way neighbor@@ hoods , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you cook from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to share apartments of reason to co @-@ share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would have the thought of common shares ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and so@@ ot@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many places that belonged to the government , &quot;
&quot; the residents were offered now . students who were looking for an lead , were offered . &quot;
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people who were out of their children . there were incub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us .
we did not re @-@ invented the wheel .
&quot; also , there was also hospitality before . &quot;
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work ?
&quot; apart from happiness and tim@@ ing , we realized that you can find the right design with the inventory of confidence . &quot;
design can help us to overcome deep root parts .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it if a red Maz@@ da goes back to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a belie@@ ver ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , being supp@@ ressed , a terror la@@ undering ? &quot;
or simply a delay in security at the airport .
that is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media people represent , which look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met Muslims , it &apos;s great to know you . &quot;
I say to you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
when I was 17 years old I met the decision to ou@@ ten me .
&quot; no , not as homos@@ exual human , like some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why don &apos;t you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lu@@ ck was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , feeling me a perfect and un@@ ri@@ able beauty ideal for me . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought after , turned into question , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow dedication that deep@@ ened themselves with any reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm will sometimes bring me to weeping .
I recognize myself . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel the feeling that someone sees you , you complete , and somehow loves ? &quot;
it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; later I had , after my marriage , a child , and lived in the bottom of the Egyptian American dream . &quot;
then came the aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked upon the screen and saw the word &quot; Express . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , planes flo@@ cked in buildings , people mo@@ cked out of buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned rapidly to indig@@ nation .
why should one do something like this ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in N@@ u changed me the deeds of others from a civil war in a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East in the United States to move into a new city and start with the building studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I drove myself -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we went to our apartment in this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; be careful , &quot; &quot; seek not in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims gather to prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a target . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably about , and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were used for Muslims , into the free cr@@ ush and struck . &quot;
there really was bran@@ dan@@ gling on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
&quot; because the people who had attacked this country , have attacked our country . &quot;
I have lost the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry .
it is not easy to under@@ take itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; nowadays , we can say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and Mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US .
there is only the question : are we mal@@ icious or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumour is being removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one can only be fed .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , enlighten@@ ing and Olymp@@ ians . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ ques America make sure ?
maybe there will be a few parking lot but not stop the terror .
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people who toler@@ ate other faith toler@@ ant , and larger citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
you will be radic@@ alised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when the radic@@ alization process has found that it begins online . as a result , the person of their church can be cut , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ stic group may cause the true Muslims , and everyone who abh@@ ors their behaviour and ide@@ ology , is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must keep people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group as the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS . &quot;
but we would like to add us into their suburbs if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you cast a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they are in their &quot; holy scriptures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it is her brut@@ ality that they can read these things into the writing .
an amazing I@@ mam told me recently an astonishing story :
a girl came to him because they curtain to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ ergy that she had spoken , she brought her to silence , and told her that her wrath was to bring her mind for un@@ righteousness in the world . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have given her anger , she was a main goal for the instrum@@ ent@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who had a solution . &quot;
this I@@ mam introduced the connection to God and their church again .
&quot; instead of having acc@@ use her anger , he showed their con@@ structive ways for a real shift in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept it to join the IS . &quot;
it was a gli@@ mp@@ se of how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia gave me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect each other ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear does not affect our democracy on our freedom of freedom ?
one study - actually several neuro@@ scientific studies - show that if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things .
&quot; we accept a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : if one shows test messages , in which negative about Muslims has been reported , they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as the circumcision of American Muslim . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; when you look , when the mood against Muslims moved to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to mos@@ lem terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to mani@@ pulation the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , the reasonable and well informed citizen . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear imp@@ lies us all .
&quot; with the assignment of collective debt , it is not only about to explain himself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was at the dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , generous human , whom they knew . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her life run . she was blo@@ om and said : &quot;
&quot; when is such a sealed young man , when ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit Su@@ zanne at her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , her murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had been in her apartment , as in an execution , after he posted utter@@ ances against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he spent eight times at De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the start .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was about how America we want to leave our children : one that would like to control us through fear , or one where we can freely pract@@ ise our religion . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , and went into the building hall , and what I saw , left me . &quot;
the hall was rest@@ less filled .
&quot; then the I@@ mam made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , because the half of the assembly were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came to attack , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; in that moment , I am collapsed . &quot;
these people were there because they had courage and compassion .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you connect to them that mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia you seem to have a nerve hit .
&quot; but I wonder what you say that you may say that you &apos;re talking a T@@ ED@@ Talk to work a reas@@ oning with deep thinking , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I wouldn &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am so usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever @-@ conducted study to Muslims around the world , want people normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity to the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
&quot; so , I am no exception in any regard . &quot;
&quot; if people like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; as a platform for Bast@@ ers , a billi@@ on@@ shop is about to become a billi@@ on@@ shop . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ act entered into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks before the audience . some years ago they started to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; due to pairs , flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in eng@@ ined space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , to deal with turbul@@ ences and to respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight .
&quot; thus , a system aut@@ on@@ om has to work , it must be colle@@ c@@ tively aware of where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are at highest levels . for example , start &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a plane that tries to beat two flying with a f@@ lap .
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ allies it is efficient , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most strong @-@ wing@@ ers it can be floating , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a swe@@ eping side . &quot;
a limitation of rear @-@ rigid is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences such as wind bows .
we develop new controllers and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the flying tool doesn &apos;t matter how to recover the optimal position , and the performance can be improved by exercise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that proceed to the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts , which are collected to viol@@ ate you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , pilots were remote controlled flying machines that had only two mov@@ able parts : one prop@@ eller and a rear axle . &quot;
we discovered that flies with only one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanical sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse , no further pitches or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life much happens so much that it can fly stable and can move up in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear light . to get it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to throw it exactly right if all of you see , is low , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a exercise in beauty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etri@@ cal .
that is why it is equivalent to ambi@@ ance in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the au@@ dition of the ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room to move in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some thing is imagin@@ able in models , the rest will be learned directly in flying . &quot;
let us see that .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they have to be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft machines .
this is clock@@ wise in clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls off , electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine when restricted . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate that , by doing a half @-@ air@@ worthy aircraft . &quot;
the last demonstration was examined synthetic swar@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a pal@@ let of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took commercial micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with local technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
each unit knows where in space she is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
&quot; hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
the most particularly safe machine there wants to be a flying lamp on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predi@@ ct the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types , such as us is the reward in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that there is creative , smart creatures , allowing them to form a spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the dot @-@ tone is on the i . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are always faster , you turned to the mass of three times in a tenth place in pure energy . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , it sh@@ ined brigh@@ ter than all stars together in all galax@@ ies of the entire universe . &quot;
it was a very big pop .
&quot; they set their energy , but not in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy has been delivered into space @-@ time emotions and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
arrange the events initially tim@@ ely .
1.3 billion years ago was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
&quot; since then the Earth has brought a lot of things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , Sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; approximately 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ ageous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver decided to build a huge laser @-@ detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are produced by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most held them mad .
but enough people recognized them as a mad gen@@ ius that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ interfer@@ omet@@ ry @-@ Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which improved the detection performance . &quot;
therefore we are called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my son &apos;s father .
basically the fruits of my life work .
&quot; all that , for what I worked for , is not longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their observ@@ atories , such as Lig@@ o measur@@ able signals . &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cro@@ pping in the feelings of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and the other gest@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; to illustr@@ ate , lecturer in courses for rel@@ ativity , often a really al@@ ber@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and dust , stretching and dust . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ation waves are extremely weak , even ridicul@@ ous , are ridicul@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched out the waves . the strain of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometer long laser detector , and it is already absurd , this length should be exactly measured at less than a thou@@ sand@@ ths of a nuclear power . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text by Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , hunting after the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cist are fin@@ der@@ ically , and with the support of the public they will be overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott claims to lig@@ o be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , size of your cell phones . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical . for example , you can make a picture or a map of things that you can perceive that of several points to the light around you . &quot;
in killing it is different .
audi@@ ble tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you very much : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks her . &quot;
&quot; d@@ ummer Bob , &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we can do not make any simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; but by doing changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least there are the measured frequencies measured in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can hear all that literally speak . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation to wait , we can tell us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott employs a very long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , not rotating holes , circul@@ ates : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies rotate fast , you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , formed in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Lig@@ o : &#91; Sur@@ render sound &#93; J@@ No , who knows what he must hear , know this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which is about as fast as the rods of your Mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : superior to us what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the most dense body in all , one with a weight of 29 suns , the other with a weight of 36 suns , revol@@ ve every hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we have heard it .
there is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o eb@@ net a totally new way to explore the Al@@ ls as it was never possible before .
&quot; on this path , we can hear the all loud and the invisible . &quot;
much in all we can see -- practical or basically -- not to see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why mass@@ ager stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we have learned a lot about all .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the core , which lies behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see when these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation waves perme@@ ate iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ g@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the alarm , but we will never see them because the urine is hidden by its own descendants . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to back up to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimi@@ stic that we exist in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we have never seen , and of which we don &apos;t have any idea . things we only discover that we will listen . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found in the first stop of things which we had not expected . &quot;
&quot; my colleague on MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says about this subject : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient body from prehistoric times . black holes are so to speak the suction bones for our archaeological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o allows us to view a completely different view to the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as cour@@ ageous as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and the cat@@ er@@ ers and the cos@@ mos of Kos@@ mos . &quot;
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ at@@ oria on Earth and All .
&quot; what could be more beautiful , than to wait for the urine itself ? &quot;
now the time is great dreams .
dre@@ aming with us .
thanks .
&quot; before some time , I tried a experiment . &quot;
&quot; a year I would say to everything &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter whether it made me nervous , brought me into un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
would I speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I be live on television ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the watching ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly that to do , w@@ ov@@ or I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; I changed . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes , that changed my life , on an unexpected art . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ explained reasons all &quot; bs , &quot;
&quot; as a wa@@ iter , she would be a wa@@ it@@ ch from the south . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ bs , I need milk for my snor@@ kel@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once , if I could play with her when I was at the jump . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; a new life @-@ setting in my family . from there I swear , always to play with them . no matter what I am doing , or wherever I go , I say yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I &apos;m not perfect but I stri@@ ve very much .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , on our family . &quot;
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : only recently I understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; -@@ S@@ agen to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things come from you wake up for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I product television .
&quot; I have television , in great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each programme provides hundreds of jobs that didn &apos;t exist before .
the budget for a television channel is between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three programs that simultaneously are in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my television series will run on Thursday evenings . &quot;
&quot; around the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are ship@@ ments which I have created itself , and not only produced , so even ob@@ end@@ able . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather for my fans and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing ?
nobody so I am a Titan .
dream job .
I would not like to im@@ press you .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author falls .
&quot; I tell you , that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now a company , a country or a class@@ room , make me serious when I say : I understand that it is not only about your computer . I don &apos;t understand that there is a dream job . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am deeper into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream , one should get a high sound , a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , funny and distur@@ bing , clin@@ ically and mother@@ ly , cruel and sensible . and the best thing about it is the sum@@ s . &quot;
there is so a change in me when working well .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows like a busy street , I could go for ever on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I read the sum@@ s of Sum@@ mary that I will talk to my writing , that the writing is prepared for me . &quot;
don &apos;t understand me wrong you do .
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I started working with television production , when I started working and collabor@@ ate , to create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this energy , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum@@ s , you can &apos;t go differently than any size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not unlike any size , doesn &apos;t matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sum@@ s .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ book .
perhaps it is gen@@ ius .
perhaps it is E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I know that I love the sum@@ s . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know that I don &apos;t want to ask it in question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear thing : the more successful I will , the more copies , the more over@@ flowing limits , the more things more , the more things more , the more things I write about history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the great clay , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum@@ s . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only that sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; now my three daughters are acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to the truth , that their mom is an only working title . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Sh@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ onda country . &quot;
these are the children of a titanium .
they are baby @-@ titanium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine was sil@@ enced .
I loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s did not come back .
my sum@@ s was broken .
&quot; I made the same thing as always : the same Titan@@ en work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked on weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , but does not sleep , does not exist with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me it was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do if that , what you do , the work you love , suddenly sp@@ ared suddenly ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think : &quot; Heu@@ l you out , stupid the author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do , you do , one loves to be a teacher , to be a teacher , a painter who knows the sum@@ s if you knew the sum@@ s even if the sum@@ s stop , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan Poker ?
&quot; if the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; South @-@ states @-@ Kell@@ ner@@ in &quot; poses a question .
&quot; I am on the way outside , late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I don &apos;t want to say , I will be aware of two things : &quot;
&quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; shame . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I missed it when I &apos;m Titan and my sum@@ s bet@@ s , and here everything changes in my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
it is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters , we laugh much and I &apos;m reading very dramatic from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in the absence of the sum@@ s , I can do nothing but out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they do not exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; everything exists , sticky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , watch@@ al@@ sti@@ p@@ ens and the song , in which it goes wrong , or whatever the girl is extingu@@ ished in &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity everywhere .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door goes up and an energi@@ ub comes in .
&quot; and not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s come slowly .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum@@ s . &quot;
and now I feel when I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it &apos;s something that we forgot .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the working day , the titanium en@@ um@@ ms , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you , who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I have been managing my brain , then I forgot what the real sum@@ s is . &quot;
the sum@@ s is no strength and it is not work specific .
it is of the joy .
the real sum@@ s is dependent on love .
&quot; the sum@@ s is the power , which comes from the life of life . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real sum@@ s igno@@ res the pressure of history , the best tasks , anticip@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
the real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am an Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this for a solid rule , so that I can free myself as a workflow of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t play a sharp two , how do they work . &quot;
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I rather am at home than at home .
&quot; this entry is painful , because what a person is working rather than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I am . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we shave around the garden , before and back , and her . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crushed soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always g@@ alle@@ ys to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live ; and the Sum@@ mon of the Universe comp@@ lies me .
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! do they always say yes when your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ i@@ v for a meeting .
&quot; you &apos;re right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ Show figure .
your child takes you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me , until they come to them that they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaced me . &quot;
&quot; and he speak@@ eth my teenage daughter every 15 minutes , with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need not need . &quot;
everyone can bring about 15 minutes on the piece even on a bad mood !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no deposit . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my charity , my world . you don &apos;t have to be the children . it applies to feel the sum@@ s to feel a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure , &quot;
around the &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you doing well .
find out it and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I have victories . friends meet , books reading , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; if you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I abandoned when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the piece why do not indul@@ ge for 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my free time . the sum@@ s seems to return when I do not work .
work doesn &apos;t work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months the door opens in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown mel@@ ody , it meets me and my soul . I feel it to new ideas . I use it in full trains and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the sum@@ s , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that sum@@ s is not me ... no more .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sticky finger , dinners with friends . &quot;
this is now my sum@@ s .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the Sum@@ mary of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; it is me , that I am a Titan I . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
&quot; and yet , I have everything in the handle . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fire is still burning . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , which I create , the marathon , whom I run , the mar@@ es , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new life feeling in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am author . I think things I &apos;m looking for life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ aming .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; too less and more games .
Titan@@ en have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you beautiful .
I am Neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very small ability to self @-@ healing healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a lasting , severe disability . &quot;
this is the reason why I was working functional Neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional Neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tried to improve the nerve functions through various surgical actions .
&quot; certainly , they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stim@@ ulation . &quot; it is im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to affect the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neurolog@@ ical function improves . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ or and heavy pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgery is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close to you .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help themselves . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was a leader and worked in the emergency department day and night .
often I found patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that at the skull @-@ Hir@@ n trau@@ mas the brain incl@@ ined and incl@@ ined the cran@@ ial pressure .
&quot; to save life , you must decrease the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes one has to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of taking the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse with Jean François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is no easy task .
&quot; cells of a tissue grow up , is comparable to very small children that will be out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the correct diet , temperature , humidity and environments to th@@ rive . &quot;
exactly that we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François abolished . &quot;
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with big green cells , surrounded by small , mature cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you know from the bi@@ ology classes that stem cells are in@@ mature cells , which can turn into each cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die they are immort@@ al .
but these cells were different .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks they died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand from where they came .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ c@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the F@@ öt@@ us stage they take care of the brain .
but why do they stay for us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so secure .
but one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; in front of a potential cell source , we will enable brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop a experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then use the cells exactly so cultivated as it did Jean @-@ François
and then they are going to mark color in order to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we im@@ planted them at the removal of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ ologist transplan@@ tation -- aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ ch transplan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we im@@ planted these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we could work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they were taken back after some weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we had an injury to and im@@ planted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
&quot; evidence that they show is these small points . these are the cells that we paint in vitro , in the culture . &quot;
we could not stop here .
are these cells also help to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity problem .
they had to take for@@ aging pellets for a tablet .
they made it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we had the motor Cort@@ ex motor sensors in the motor c@@ ort@@ ex range . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they moved spontan@@ e@@ ously to a certain degree , just like a stroke . &quot;
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover at a certain degree just as at the monkeys .
&quot; as we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , they see the monkeys that took spontan@@ e@@ ously . &quot;
it can cause some 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after friction plant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and use later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; but our dream is still , to im@@ planted them in humans . &quot;
&quot; I hope I really hope to show you soon , how the human brain gives the means to heal himself . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that there are several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know somebody who need it . &quot;
I definitely want .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest barriers are , before you can begin clinical trials on humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies .
BG : that is understand@@ able ; the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a almost professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to get the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy is available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon ?
then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this on a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment . &quot;
&quot; BG : and that &apos;s sure , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for your visit at T@@ ED and that you have told us .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we make a great mistake to consider them as of course . &quot;
we do not see democracy as the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality but as the inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changeable weight .
we believe capitalism is forced to fight democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a blo@@ oming capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; indeed , democracy comes with us in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I re@@ presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- declared that the democratic process of our country -- was in@@ comprehen@@ sible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs which were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; in that moment , I thought that there could be no better justi@@ fication for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev or the Communist Party of China , or some of my adv@@ ent friends who would say that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present an economic model for a real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I beg you , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ev , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group will save us , but we could need to help us democracy but that we need a truly known and def@@ en@@ viable democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are brick , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contra@@ diction , which currently threat@@ ens our host . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the Deb@@ berg , who thro@@ ws his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt of debt , &quot;
but only few recognize his di@@ dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which , however , belongs to the ver@@ itable savings and corporations that could be productive there , where it might be productive and income could produce , with which you could produce productive debt and even all the things you need to produce , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 billion US dollars invested in all the wealth of productive goods , such as industrial installations , machines , office building , schools , roads , tracks and so on . &quot;
&quot; according to a lot of money , 3.4 trillion US dollars is compar@@ ing a lot of money until you were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to do except for stock markets and real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; so debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe , and consequently , a low degree of economic demand that could not carry out that his son would kill him when he is growing , &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances that lead to this lead to kill him . &quot;
this is my shar@@ ks with capitalism --
&quot; all the non @-@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , developing human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
I think already . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as social form to control the free and the poor as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was of course too many .
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to reduce the job value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these events . &quot;
&quot; the decision on the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that they were entering the working poor , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but important and crucial to them that they have the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of state p@@ liers . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long --
&quot; like a candle , the very light sh@@ ines , it is also fast burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation of politics and economy possible , and the democratic process was transferred to politics , while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democratic demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the date , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable battle between the two instead of the economy gradually emigrated to politics . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier ?
it is not on a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is concerned that one can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is ab@@ out@@ ned and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my shar@@ ks with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of prey that feeds the animals , from which she feeds , dec@@ im@@ ated , that she is hungry for the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that has politics as far as so far , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations increases , the ine@@ quality increases , the m@@ acro@@ economic demand and the managing director of the corporations have to be anxi@@ ous to invest in cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the successful capitalism sells the &quot; demos &quot; of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human workers and wealth of mankind . &quot;
&quot; when this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is no new idea . &quot;
the Marx@@ ist left had already had this idea ago 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the doctrine of the de@@ ac@@ ic of the Soviet Union should be , that the working arms should only achieve a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ glo@@ bet@@ s by automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is , so long economy and politics are separate , the automation of the twin peaks are higher , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; thus , we have to re@@ unite the economy and the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we want to meet the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease control hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ cracy , which will be published in a disease matrix &quot; &quot; such as documentation . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; or by something that the society used in the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long talks to the sense of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimi@@ stic .
&quot; so what if so , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I want to give you in all brief , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the company : ask a capital market , in which you deserve money while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is owned by those who work in the company . &quot;
then all income from capital and revenues generated and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
&quot; no distinction more between those who belong to the company , but do not belong in it , and employees who work there . no divers attract more between capital and work@@ ings , and ultimately no big g@@ aps between investment and sp@@ ars , and ultimately no longer twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies had a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 biggest emerging countries &#93; , in interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Kos@@ mos &quot; &apos; -- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; also , imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically that John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that one had not had the technical resources at that time .
&quot; today , we have them , especially in the background of a re@@ united politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world , which I describe you , is at the same time liber@@ ally speaking , in which they privileged persons , and mar@@ x@@ istic , because they buried the separation of capital and work in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , globally key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide to fight politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you commit yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marx@@ ist .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I said exactly is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... do we do that , the technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand which Larry Sum@@ mer describes as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal daily Marx@@ ist , and as Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosoph@@ ical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Red@@ ner , you have told you what you have seen from the view of the West to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the certificate of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of it plays , -- the area of the economy -- a completely democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain way , when I may say that this is so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was particularly scep@@ tical , affecting the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what you can now watch in China , very similar to the development which we had in England during the Industrial Revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China is trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century , sm@@ ells tremendous after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners were curious to share your experiences as finance minister in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that this comes .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal vision , and very dis@@ appointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not just Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely to say goodbye to the self @-@ counterfeit banknotes , and the per@@ sever@@ ity den@@ ial that a massive understanding line through the euro zone was , and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek court -- the way , the first suggest@@ ion that was revealed to this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers are elected within the Eurozone , within the European group , continues to den@@ ying the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you are trying to receive an economic system that is not exagger@@ ated , by political will and auth@@ orization to life , it may be able to run out a while , but if the change occurs , he happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what change will you see ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their setup .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister , who claims after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , he claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the monetary policy to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they only wanted to fall only our government , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the tests that ran through the Eurozone . &quot;
they didn &apos;t want to admit that she had been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
no one out of the Tro@@ ika of the money that has imposed us this policy said : &quot; this was a Colom@@ bian mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive T@@ ons of talks , you seem to be quite a single @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposite someone who lives and loves . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they did not survive , they will destroy the demon@@ ic forces of Dä@@ mon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we introduce ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will also be acceptable for the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of them never heard , although he probably is responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it to produce the shows and the content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are located on the right on this turn . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB &apos;s website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received .
will your show be rated with nine and higher is this one winner .
then one has a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad &quot; , &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are ad@@ dic@@ tive , where you saw a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left hand , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ ler and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you what is going on this end of the turn . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not move on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average balance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they are simply not am@@ eless . &quot;
so he must ensure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and elec@@ ts up eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch each of them . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is free for free , it is possible to get right ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed during the watch of this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team that receive everything .
&quot; you will capture when you start the show when you embar@@ rass@@ ing , which parts you ski@@ pping and look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide with these data which show them should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these , and this is the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com on four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve amounts to 7.5 -- so little above the average , but not just what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top @-@ show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking for finding this one super show and he uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of organizing a competition , he and his team maintains the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews that they give the shows , their course , which shows them , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer : which shows them , what producer , which actor . &quot;
&quot; when they had gathered all the parts , they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; two very competent , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision to meet , then one should meet a good decision . &quot;
we have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
we optimized it by a very powerful computer .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is something terri@@ fying because we live in a time that we want more and more about statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know here the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in contact with this software . come in touch and are in prison .
&quot; if anyone ask here in the USA and for release , it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide if a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results . this is not sure that a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced firms are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google makes mistakes sometimes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis of flu , the worse type , failure -- by data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonder@@ fully and was a great news release . the success is in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly did not work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was a sensation again , including the release of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data diversi@@ fied companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all of these mistakes in decisions of life , a -- on the workplace , in law en@@ forcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data are helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in the computer @-@ ai@@ ded gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people will use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or development of a drug . over the years I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be common .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you have to do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , you can analyze this problem in its parts , so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second place you put the items back together to summar@@ ize a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help solve a problem and understand his parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to assemble the parts , and then come to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all possess : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that the brain is good , it is parts and pieces come together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to receive a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they have used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; you use data to understand their audience better , for what else would have been unable to understand why they would not have any of these parts , come back and get a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; that doesn &apos;t stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , however , did this on the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all of their decisions , first as they w@@ ett@@ led by TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; they say the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong if data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are only a tool , and in order to forget this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will be ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a J@@ a- or no @-@ question you must shake only the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life , where I should listen to the ball in the night . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them through something much more wis@@ er , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic setup .
&quot; perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . finally , it is in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions , an expert in which you do , and risks to go . &quot;
&quot; because at the end , it is not the data but the risks where you finish at the right end of the turn . &quot;
thank you beautiful .
