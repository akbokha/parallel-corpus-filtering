<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard by Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular, that the NSA heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US secret service, in which the CIA was literally spared to Iran for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not taste the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has identified against Risen and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became the symbol for the design of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if the media cannot get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mutigen they will give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government at Risen ankle, he did something that many courageous reporter had already done before him: he refused to go and said that he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something exceptional happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were longing for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped to rap."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in time electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failure and canopy to make statements, this could also do his digital footsteps for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so, investigators, without his understanding, concerned his telephone calls, is concerned,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"like its e-mail data, financial and banana information, its credit card, and even travel insurance with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA-whistleblower and cracks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama spoke in his appeal to protect Whistleblower, but instead, the judiciary has more condemns than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how that can be a problem, especially because the government is too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article about national security was the result of that a Whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we set the press work on the game which should be protected by the first constitutional atz because the government has always has more possibilities to express all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, as technology of the government allows to handle the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can contact them from the moment, in which they contact you rather than in the night, in the witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that had not been written, when Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal emails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is a SecureDrop, an open source program for Whistleblower that was originally developed by the internet famous Aaron Swartz, and today has been developed by Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to an news website, like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"you can instantly upload documents or information, as in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot procure any more information, and many of the information you would like, would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments are always developing new spy technologies, which are all endangered."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that not only technology, such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring iniquities. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the lack of abuse of soldiers are modest, and of overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers, the alarm to contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider, who warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes but to protect our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was published.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal that the rich and Might] have been hidden in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness to have a statement.] This week we received news about a Leck of 11 million documents in Panama-based law firm Mosseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of this documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"in fact, we actually see the e-mails, exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already been very direct consequences for the first.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister is resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad sent letters in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of $2 billion to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others to wait for the next publication, and to the next enthrations documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it shes away from you, my ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and mighty in the location are to hide their wealth in tax havases and not all of their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in all over the world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens of some few are used to hide their assets and conceals -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appears very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havases work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always make it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one company has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to understand who is behind this prayer."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were no prominent Americans, which occurred in these revelations, to this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not so, that there is no rich Americans dealing with their assets in tax havases."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"we would have a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples see the connections to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to give less information to establish a company than to get a library."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the United States has allowed employees from school districts to cut school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has been permitted, especially vulnerable to investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself to an African minister, the suspects money to the US wanted to buy a home, a yacht to buy a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"for us, it really shocked us that all until on a lawyer's proposals, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preferences. none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nothing was handed over to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It does not work for a single lawyer showing our hidden investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single leading politiker, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to handle this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"all this may sound very comforting, as if we could do anything against it; as if nothing would have changed, as if it is always the rich and mighty."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as born optimist I don't see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen some transparency to more transparency, affecting the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic was political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then the EU has been recorded in central registers at the national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States arrived here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have taken a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havases, used as funds used to ensure in the US and global for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who are furious, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudostems."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparent is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it, through laws this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finally stop the intransparency that allows you to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I have abducted almost abducted and in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made an advance sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep today? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he did the whole thing worse:" I don't know yet. ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just didn't know him! he says he would not go to peace, but I don't know if he is really planning. I don't want to landing in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard me saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Take, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I lay down in bed, I stared on the ceiling and thought:" Oh man! what have I broken? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wildfire sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such fear that I went out of the bed, turned on tiftips to the door, and my sleeping door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art that he had purchased from me, is now in his classroom. he is a teacher now."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it has changed my angles completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood as strangers were, actually, friends who were waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air mattress was normal for me, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommates and rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that there was a design conference in the city at that time. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, be afraid of fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I think we could earn something like that. our apartment will stay in a designer Bed-and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress in a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">"they found it great, and we too."</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to tasted our cheese ham-Omelet completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we opened our last guest, and the door to the castle, Brian and I went on."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and we could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented ourselves to investors:" we want to create a website, on the people publicly posts of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms, whose doors are shut down. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But she did not do.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very comfort, would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned as kids that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you're talking about the things you can do. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just look and aptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create by design immense trust, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust in design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasting, which the degree of confidence we dispute."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone in hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlock mobile phone on your left sitting area.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight from panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing that is more than your mobile phone, your home is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can't just read your SMS, you see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"most guests feel, even if they stay elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">But who has now Al Gores's cell now?</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you tell Twitter, that he is the president of the President?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have experienced what kind of confidence we want to build. I want to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would only have imagined with his name; if he would have told, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 assessments, which all say:" he can really keep very well closed cell phones! "</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you have to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-kept feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to withdraw negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest were submitted to their assessments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we evaluated how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how they are similar to ages and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising we trust the people most that are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predatatess.</seg>
<seg id="181">"exciting, it will be exciting if you add the call of one person -- in our case by assessments."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation of similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"so, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences."</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we discovered that trust is dependent on how much you are cheaper."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when you tell me too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"it tells a lot, like for example:" I have problems with my mother, "-- -- if the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" Tolle artwork in your apartment! I do with my family holiday. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give advice on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with what we did not reckoned, the great amount of people who were more than ready to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the shop runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times if not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who are unallowed parties to be celebrated or homes devastated.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing more than these calls. I just do if I think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the voice, and will always be our greatest motivation to improve us."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays, only a fraction had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people trust one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, there can be a miracle."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holiday in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him into the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even spends blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protagonists who save life, even though they don't know any right."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive a hospital in the hospital, when one dies, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to be lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">"they can even stay longer, without charge the extra-nights."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay runs."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure monetary transaction are exactly what you want to reach with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of part with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it's just" "lease industry" "will not just be justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a portion of themselves open and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"however, what would be a rich buffet of local objections?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place that you visited, a group there would have been waiting to fill a thorough and fill in one of a bar-way neighborhoods, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you cook from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to share apartments of reason to co-share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would have the thought of common shares?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and sootation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many places that belonged to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"the residents were offered now. students who were looking for an lead, were offered."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people who were out of their children. there were incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not re-invented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"also, there was also hospitality before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the inventory of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us to overcome deep root parts.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it if a red Mazda goes back to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, being suppressed, a terror laundering?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in security at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">That is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media people represent, which look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met Muslims, it's great to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I say to you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern Fitness-fanatics,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I met the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human, like some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why don't you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Luck was: at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old, feeling me a perfect and unriable beauty ideal for me."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought after, turned into question, doubted, and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow dedication that deepened themselves with any reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm will sometimes bring me to weeping.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel the feeling that someone sees you, you complete, and somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later I had, after my marriage, a child, and lived in the bottom of the Egyptian American dream."</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked upon the screen and saw the word" Express. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, planes flocked in buildings, people mocked out of buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned rapidly to indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like this?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..." in the name of Islam... "..." jihad... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in Nu changed me the deeds of others from a civil war in a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East in the United States to move into a new city and start with the building studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I drove myself -- as we were silent -- so deep it went to my seat, and I was the first time to be recognized as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we went to our apartment in this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said:" be vigilant, "" be careful, "" seek not in well lit areas, "" "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims gather to prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again, the warnings:" do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target. "</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably about, and I heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were used for Muslims, into the free crush and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was brandangling on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because the people who had attacked this country, have attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have lost the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to undertake itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"nowadays, we can say people:" there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and Mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is being removed as a whole and a benign tumor one can only be fed.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, enlightening and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Mosques America make sure?</seg>
<seg id="331">Maybe there will be a few parking lot but not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people who tolerate other faith tolerant, and larger citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">You will be radicalised in their cellar or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when the radicalization process has found that it begins online. as a result, the person of their church can be cut, even by their family, so that the extremistic group may cause the true Muslims, and everyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology, is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must keep people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group as the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group as the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add us into their suburbs if you recognize it as a representative of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you cast a look at them, they don't drive what they are in their" holy scriptures "." "</seg>
<seg id="345">It is her brutality that they can read these things into the writing.</seg>
<seg id="346">An amazing Imam told me recently an astonishing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because they curtain to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him whether they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergy that she had spoken, she brought her to silence, and told her that her wrath was to bring her mind for unrighteousness in the world."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have given her anger, she was a main goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who had a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and their church again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of having accuse her anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real shift in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept it to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was a glimpse of how the Islamophobia gave me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect each other?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear does not affect our democracy on our freedom of freedom?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study - actually several neuroscientific studies - show that if we fear ourselves will happen at least three things.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: if one shows test messages, in which negative about Muslims has been reported, they vote rather military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as the circumcision of American Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look, when the mood against Muslims moved to the top -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then it happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the advance of Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to moslem terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, the reasonable and well informed citizen."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first but the toxic air of fear implies us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the assignment of collective debt, it is not only about to explain himself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, generous human, whom they knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">"she visited him there, and he showed her life run. she was bloom and said:"</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a sealed young man, when?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, her murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who had been in her apartment, as in an execution, after he posted utterances against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He spent eight times at Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">"fanatism can not only be immoral, but also fatal."</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the start.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was about how America we want to leave our children: one that would like to control us through fear, or one where we can freely practise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove in silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, and went into the building hall, and what I saw, left me."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was restless filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because the half of the assembly were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, believers and non-believers who came to attack, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"in that moment, I am collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanatism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you connect to them that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you beautiful!</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air pact entered into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France has built a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks before the audience. some years ago they started to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"due to pairs, flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in engined space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, to deal with turbulences and to respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to exceed the limits of the possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus, a system autonom has to work, it must be collectively aware of where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are at highest levels. for example, start" "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other Starrallies it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most strong-wingers it can be floating, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a sweeping side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-rigid is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the flying tool doesn't matter how to recover the optimal position, and the performance can be improved by exercise."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that proceed to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smaller number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known about as machines with a thousand mobile parts, which are collected to violate you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, pilots were remote controlled flying machines that had only two movable parts: one propeller and a rear axle."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flies with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanical simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and transverse, no further pitches or control surfaces, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life much happens so much that it can fly stable and can move up in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear light. to get it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly right if all of you see, is low, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Monospinner is a exercise in beauty, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is equivalent to ambiance in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the audition of the ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room to move in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as he rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some thing is imaginable in models, the rest will be learned directly in flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they have to be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is clockwise in clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a engine or propeller falls off, electronics or a battery -- can still fly the machine when restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will demonstrate that, by doing a half-airworthy aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration was examined synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a pallet of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we took commercial micro-Quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with local technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space she is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, you will motivate this demonstrations to think new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">The most particularly safe machine there wants to be a flying lamp on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">"for types, such as us is the reward in the development and the creative act."</seg>

<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy has been delivered into space-time emotions and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Arrange the events initially timely.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has brought a lot of things: corals, fish, plants, Saurier, people and -- God stand with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"approximately 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever decided to build a huge laser-detector to search for gravitational waves, which are produced by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most held them mad.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as a mad genius that the US National Science Foundation has financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely much hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser-interferometry-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which improved the detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we are called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my son's father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically the fruits of my life work.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that, for what I worked for, is not longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational waves of black holes and their observatories, such as Ligo measurable signals."</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a cropping in the feelings of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when crossing the shaft, the space and its entire content will be stretched into one direction and the other gestures."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate, lecturer in courses for relativity, often a really albery dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretching and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitation waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous, are ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched out the waves. the strain of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometer long laser detector, and it is already absurd, this length should be exactly measured at less than a thousandths of a nuclear power. that's grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text by Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, hunting after the waves:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicist are finderically, and with the support of the public they will be overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott claims to ligo be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical. for example, you can make a picture or a map of things that you can perceive that of several points to the light around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">In killing it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible tones have a wave length of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that make you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"dummer Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do not make any simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by doing changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are the measured frequencies measured in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can hear all that literally speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"gravitation to wait, we can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott employs a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circulates: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies rotate fast, you hear the same circulation with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, formed in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard Ligo: [Surrender sound] JNo, who knows what he must hear, know this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which is about as fast as the rods of your Mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: superior to us what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the most dense body in all, one with a weight of 29 suns, the other with a weight of 36 suns, revolve every hundred times per second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo ebnet a totally new way to explore the Alls as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this path, we can hear the all loud and the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can see -- practical or basically -- not to see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massager stars in supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we have learned a lot about all.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur in the core, which lies behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see when these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves permeate iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urgall: I would like to explore the first minutes of the alarm, but we will never see them because the urine is hidden by its own descendants."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitation waves, it should be possible to back up to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that we exist in all things we've never seen, which we have never seen, and of which we don't have any idea. things we only discover that we will listen."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found in the first stop of things which we had not expected."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague on MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says about this subject: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient body from prehistoric times. black holes are so to speak the suction bones for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo allows us to view a completely different view to the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and the caterers and the cosmos of Kosmos."</seg>

<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly that to do, wovor I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep talking, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," I changed. "</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes, that changed my life, on an unexpected art. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplained reasons all" bs, "</seg>
<seg id="570">"as a waiter, she would be a waitch from the south."</seg>
<seg id="571">"Bibs, I need milk for my snorkeling."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once, if I could play with her when I was at the jump. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new life-setting in my family. from there I swear, always to play with them. no matter what I am doing, or wherever I go, I say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect but I strive very much.</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: only recently I understood that the "Yes" -Sagen to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things come from you wake up for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I product television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I have television, in great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each programme provides hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for a television channel is between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three programs that simultaneously are in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my television series will run on Thursday evenings."</seg>
<seg id="594">"around the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are shipments which I have created itself, and not only produced, so even obendable. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather for my fans and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">Nobody so I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you, that all of you who work so hard, whether you are now a company, a country or a classroom, make me serious when I say: I understand that it is not only about your computer. I don't understand that there is a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">I work much, hard and I love it. "</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I am deeper into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dream, one should get a high sound, a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and motherly, cruel and sensible. and the best thing about it is the sums."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows like a busy street, I could go for ever on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I read the sums of Summary that I will talk to my writing, that the writing is prepared for me."</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong you do.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I started working with television production, when I started working and collaborate, to create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this energy, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sums, you can't go differently than any size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not unlike any size, doesn't matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workbook.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know that I don't want to ask it in question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear thing: the more successful I will, the more copies, the more overflowing limits, the more things more, the more things more, the more things I write about history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the great clay, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sums. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only that sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth, that their mom is an only working title."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Shittens, I want to go to Shonda country. "</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine was silenced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same thing as always: the same Titanen work, 15 hours-days, worked on weekends, no remorse, but does not sleep, does not exist with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me it was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do if that, what you do, the work you love, suddenly spared suddenly?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think:" Heul you out, stupid the author Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do, you do, one loves to be a teacher, to be a teacher, a painter who knows the sums if you knew the sums even if the sums stop, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan Poker?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "South-states-Kellnerin" poses a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way outside, late and she says:" Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I don't want to say, I will be aware of two things:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It doesn't call anyone "shame."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I missed it when I'm Titan and my sums bets, and here everything changes in my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">It is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters, we laugh much and I'm reading very dramatic from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in the absence of the sums, I can do nothing but out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they do not exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything exists, sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, watchalstipens and the song, in which it goes wrong, or whatever the girl is extinguished in" The Ice Queen "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energiub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums come slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sums."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It's something that we forgot.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working day, the titanium enumms, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you, who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I have been managing my brain, then I forgot what the real sums is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums is no strength and it is not work specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is of the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the sums is the power, which comes from the life of life."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums ignores the pressure of history, the best tasks, anticipation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am an Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this for a solid rule, so that I can free myself as a workflow of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"don't play a sharp two, how do they work."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work, because I love it. "</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at home than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, because what a person is working rather than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I am."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we shave around the garden, before and back, and her."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushed soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always galleys to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live; and the Summon of the Universe complies me.</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always say yes when your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naiv for a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you're right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child takes you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at most 15 minutes with me, until they come to them that they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a Marienkäfer or biscuit replaced me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and he speaketh my teenage daughter every 15 minutes, with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can bring about 15 minutes on the piece even on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no deposit."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my charity, my world. you don't have to be the children. it applies to feel the sums to feel a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I have victories. friends meet, books reading, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"if you want to play?" is short for everything I abandoned when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in training, when I wanted to surpass more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece why do not indulge for 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my free time. the sums seems to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months the door opens in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it meets me and my soul. I feel it to new ideas. I use it in full trains and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that sums is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinners with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my sums.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the Summary of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me, that I am a Titan I. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">"and yet, I have everything in the handle. my brain is still working. my bonfire is still burning."</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, which I create, the marathon, whom I run, the mares, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, beating, naked and new life feeling in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am author. I think things I'm looking for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreaming.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" too less and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanen have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very small ability to self-healing healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a lasting, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is the reason why I was working functional Neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional Neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tried to improve the nerve functions through various surgical actions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard of one of the most well-known, the" Tiefenhirnstimulation. "it is implanted a electrode deep in the brain to affect the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease which suffered severe tremor and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgery is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help themselves."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was a leader and worked in the emergency department day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I found patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that at the skull-Hirn traumas the brain inclined and inclined the cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you must decrease the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes one has to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of taking the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse with Jean François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells of a tissue grow up, is comparable to very small children that will be out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the correct diet, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">Exactly that we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François abolished."</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with big green cells, surrounded by small, mature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you know from the biology classes that stem cells are inmature cells, which can turn into each cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks they died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand from where they came.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the Fötus stage they take care of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so secure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"in front of a potential cell source, we will enable brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop a experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then use the cells exactly so cultivated as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And then they are going to mark color in order to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted them at the removal of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplantation -- autotranch transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we implanted these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we could work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they were taken back after some weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we had an injury to and implanted the same cells and now remained the cells -- it grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence that they show is these small points. these are the cells that we paint in vitro, in the culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Are these cells also help to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity problem.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take foraging pellets for a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we had the motor Cortex motor sensors in the motor cortex range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they moved spontaneously to a certain degree, just like a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover at a certain degree just as at the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">"as we were sure that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand, they see the monkeys that took spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can cause some 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after friction plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that were very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">"but our dream is still, to implanted them in humans."</seg>
<seg id="882">"I hope I really hope to show you soon, how the human brain gives the means to heal himself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that there are several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know somebody who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely want.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest barriers are, before you can begin clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill up about two kilograms of papers and forms to run this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: that is understandable; the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried permission to get the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy is available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to allow the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this on a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment."</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that's sure, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for your visit at TED and that you have told us.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we make a great mistake to consider them as of course."</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality but as the inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchangeable weight.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism is forced to fight democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yev, Singapore and his great descendants in Beijing have proved that it is quite possible to have a blooming capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy comes with us in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- declared that the democratic process of our country -- was incomprehensible to me that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- do not affect the austerity programs which were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"in that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yev or the Communist Party of China, or some of my advent friends who would say that democracy would be abolished when they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present an economic model for a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I beg you, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yev, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup will save us, but we could need to help us democracy but that we need a truly known and defenviable democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are brick, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which currently threatens our host."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the Debberg, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only few recognize his didymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which, however, belongs to the veritable savings and corporations that could be productive there, where it might be productive and income could produce, with which you could produce productive debt and even all the things you need to produce, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 billion US dollars invested in all the wealth of productive goods, such as industrial installations, machines, office building, schools, roads, tracks and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"according to a lot of money, 3.4 trillion US dollars is comparing a lot of money until you were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to do except for stock markets and real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"so debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe, and consequently, a low degree of economic demand that could not carry out that his son would kill him when he is growing,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances that lead to this lead to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my sharks with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the non-productive capital should be used to improve our lives, developing human talents and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think already. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as social form to control the free and the poor as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy was of course too many.</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to reduce the job value of the Athenian democracy because of these events."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision on the athenian democracy was and is that they were entering the working poor, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but important and crucial to them that they have the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of state pliers."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, the very light shines, it is also fast burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation of politics and economy possible, and the democratic process was transferred to politics, while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democratic democracies, since the date, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable battle between the two instead of the economy gradually emigrated to politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not on a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is concerned that one can be in the government nowadays, and still not in power because the power of politics into the economy is aboutned and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of prey that feeds the animals, from which she feeds, decimated, that she is hungry for the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that has politics as far as so far, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations increases, the inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand and the managing director of the corporations have to be anxious to invest in cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the successful capitalism sells the" demos "of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human workers and wealth of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"when this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is no new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea ago 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine of the deacic of the Soviet Union should be, that the working arms should only achieve a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-globets by automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, so long economy and politics are separate, the automation of the twin peaks are higher, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"thus, we have to reunite the economy and the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we want to meet the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease control hyperautocrcracy, which will be published in a disease matrix" "such as documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"therefore, the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievements which he has brought forth --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" "Star Trek", "or by something that the society used in the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what if so, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" Matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I want to give you in all brief, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of the company: ask a capital market, in which you deserve money while you are working and in your capital you will follow you from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are currently working -- is owned by those who work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income from capital and revenues generated and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction more between those who belong to the company, but do not belong in it, and employees who work there. no divers attract more between capital and workings, and ultimately no big gaps between investment and spars, and ultimately no longer twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please imagine that our national currencies had a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 biggest emerging countries], in interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is acted in this currency -- call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Kosmos "'-- and every government pays the sum that corresponds to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of the country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"also, imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically that John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that one had not had the technical resources at that time.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, especially in the background of a reunited politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world, which I describe you, is at the same time liberally speaking, in which they privileged persons, and marxistic, because they buried the separation of capital and work in the trash of history, and keynesian, globally keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide to fight politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You commit yourself in your biography itself as a liberal Marxist.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I said exactly is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy is... do we do that, the technological development will generate such a massive decline in the overall economic demand which Larry Summer describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"through the transfer of this crisis of a part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"as Hayek, that's why I am a liberal daily Marxist, and as Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the Redner, you have told you what you have seen from the view of the West to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the certificate of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of it plays, -- the area of the economy -- a completely democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain way, when I may say that this is so provocative, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was particularly sceptical, affecting the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what you can now watch in China, very similar to the development which we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China is trying to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells tremendous after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners were curious to share your experiences as finance minister in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that this comes.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal vision, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not just Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely to say goodbye to the self-counterfeit banknotes, and the perseverity denial that a massive understanding line through the euro zone was, and continues to be threatened by the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek court -- the way, the first suggestion that was revealed to this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers are elected within the Eurozone, within the European group, continues to denying the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you are trying to receive an economic system that is not exaggerated, by political will and authorization to life, it may be able to run out a while, but if the change occurs, he happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change will you see?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change their setup.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernest...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any Minister, who claims after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, he claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The greatest error was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the monetary policy to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they only wanted to fall only our government, just because they didn't want to deal with the tests that ran through the Eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that she had been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">No one out of the Troika of the money that has imposed us this policy said: "this was a Colombian mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive Tons of talks, you seem to be quite a single-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposite someone who lives and loves."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, they will destroy the demonic forces of Dämonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have catastrophic consequences alone, but for the entire world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we introduce ourselves the way of a post-modern 1930, what it appears to me, it will also be acceptable for the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of them never heard, although he probably is responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a Igelfrisur and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for it to produce the shows and the content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are located on the right on this turn."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB's website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows are received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Will your show be rated with nine and higher is this one winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad "," Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where you saw a season, your brain asks," Where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left hand, here at this end, shows like" Toddler and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you what is going on this end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not move on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average balance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they are simply not ameless."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must ensure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and elects up eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and presents them online where they can watch each of them."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is free for free, it is possible to get right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed during the watch of this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team that receive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you will capture when you start the show when you embarrassing, which parts you skipping and look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide with these data which show them should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these, and this is the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom on four Republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many to remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- since the average of this curve amounts to 7.5 -- so little above the average, but not just what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has plazed a top-show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking for finding this one super show and he uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of organizing a competition, he and his team maintains the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews that they give the shows, their course, which shows them, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewer: which shows them, what producer, which actor."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had gathered all the parts, they entered a venture and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards ". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"two very competent, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision to meet, then one should meet a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">We have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">We optimized it by a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is something terrifying because we live in a time that we want more and more about statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know here the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes in contact with this software. come in touch and are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone ask here in the USA and for release, it is likely that data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide if a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there are evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results. this is not sure that a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced firms are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google makes mistakes sometimes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it can be predicted by data analysis of flu, the worse type, failure -- by data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news release. the success is in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly did not work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was a sensation again, including the release of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data diversified companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all of these mistakes in decisions of life, a -- on the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in the computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very smart people will use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or development of a drug. over the years I recognized some samples by the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be common.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you have to do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, you can analyze this problem in its parts, so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a second place you put the items back together to summarize a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help solve a problem and understand his parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to assemble the parts, and then come to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that the brain is good, it is parts and pieces come together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to receive a good decision -- especially when the brain is an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think was Netflix so successful because they have used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"you use data to understand their audience better, for what else would have been unable to understand why they would not have any of these parts, come back and get a show like" House of Cards "that doesn't stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show what meant that they entered a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, however, did this on the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all of their decisions, first as they wettled by TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "they say the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong if data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are only a tool, and in order to forget this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will be...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you must shake only the ball to get an answer. "highly likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life, where I should listen to the ball in the night."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them through something much more wiser, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic setup.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. finally, it is in us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the great amount of data still pays off to make decisions, an expert in which you do, and risks to go."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because at the end, it is not the data but the risks where you finish at the right end of the turn."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you beautiful.</seg>
