&quot; Munich 1856 : four cards , which change your view to the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren @-@ An@@ st@@ alt where people will meet young people .
&quot; a greeting chapel , where the S @-@ Bahn tunnel will be dug . &quot;
small hus@@ band@@ men act the most likely reason of farmers .
the oldest official map coin encour@@ ages exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s annoying when maps are not currently available .
&quot; everyone knows that , who had to meet himself , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i took place a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ l@@ ases , an offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are all other than currently - but just therefore very rich . &quot;
especially when you compare it with current online maps .
&quot; then , how towns and municipalities have changed in the region &apos;s spread @-@ area since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a Fli@@ ck@@ ent@@ ep@@ p@@ I recognis@@ es as such as such .
&quot; in the great transition card , towns and municipalities were registered for more detailed maps , so @-@ called jungle leaves . &quot;
&quot; these originated according to the Bavarian survey@@ ing management between 1810 and 1864 , and the first survey@@ ing of Bavaria . &quot;
your Client : Napoleon .
&quot; in the spring of 1800 , the French armies occupied Bavaria since the Second Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ er War with Austria . &quot;
&quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course , for military purposes . &quot;
even if the French troops invaded the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 1801 : it was the present neighbours that created the idea of a covering Bavaria card .
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische survey@@ ing management . &quot;
&quot; the Ur@@ inist sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 , and is like all the others on the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
&quot; the comparison of the country / today , the regional capital is the most impressive . &quot;
&quot; the city has grown up in all directions , and has grown together . &quot;
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ merged , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was born 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , as a Munich district . &quot;
&quot; today , Sub@@ scri@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses were located around 1856 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which only named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er , a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West Park is , you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance : when in the zo@@ oming , a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original photo &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots there are no farmers working there today , but small hus@@ band@@ men of the plant in the sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Lower send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , since 1810 scene of the Oktober@@ fest , was actually a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Ur@@ inist dial reads in the field of today &apos;s Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen district , not only the street names &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the An@@ höhe &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren An@@ st@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field road , there was once people locked with mad@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; there was 1858 / 59 , the Munich district of Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ders &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den headed the establishment of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought to King Louis &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and finished , for example , the anchor of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has addressed the staff , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who employs an exhibition with the An@@ st@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients had been first place , later on 500 places it was expanded . &quot;
&quot; sometime , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreis@@ ir@@ ren@@ anstalt in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
&quot; on the area of former Au@@ er An@@ st@@ alt , young people will meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and went into a youth home with training . &quot;
&quot; west is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses dating from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in architectural re@@ jection to the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was around 1856 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department of the department called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War as well as in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Allies broke out in December 1944 in the city centre .
a big remained until today - on the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , Small Business Houses and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were at the Mari@@ enhof at the same time and on 5 April 2017 , I will take place for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the sh@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich map can be compare with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole in the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
citizen legal Group published travel@@ war@@ nings for Missouri
&quot; the National Association for promoting Far@@ ming has issued a warning for coloured people , who are travelling due to the discri@@ min@@ ating politics and the rac@@ ist attacks of the State after Missouri . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri , which is to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , because a number of un@@ question@@ able , racial @-@ based incident occurred throughout the state and can be noted here , &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently det@@ ective law of Missouri which makes it harder to capture Dis@@ cri@@ mination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who aim to release the tra@@ ce@@ fully on minorities , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , the people pass . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star said they will be put together because of their skin colour . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven &apos;t heard .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited inci@@ dents against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under un@@ question@@ able circumstances early in the beginning of the year , after completing the state no petrol had taken more and taken by the police of Missouri in custody , without being accused of crimes . &quot;
&quot; the Council also refers to a recently published report of the office of the State Pro@@ secution , which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff informed about what happened in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring it to the opportunity , or the relatives have to know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 supporters in the year 2015 , according to the latest figures from the Hass@@ elt @-@ report program of the FBI , which occurred the state in terms of such injuries to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain about a company due to residential or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had issued a travel bud@@ get@@ es for Texas and Arizona after the states of immigration authorities committed to unite people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to the AC@@ L@@ U &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but in recent times , stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric gate project is elementary
the fishing b@@ acher @-@ fence @-@ project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have a picture in front of the spot .
representatives of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family members met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into its operation , which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milk &quot; is an alternative solution for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the cottages only comes regional .
&quot; since it is also BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he called the &quot; elem@@ ental project &quot; as &quot; elem@@ ental project . &quot; &quot;
I can not profit on such a steep surfaces .
&quot; green land@@ marks for a lot of work , much must be processed with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ ter@@ al operation and approved this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it does not perform bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has known the importance of the dec@@ eption project , and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
we hope so that the view of the areas could still be gone out for a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they bring forth their operation , &quot; the mayor stressed . &quot;
farmers are often standing in the cr@@ iti@@ que
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
&quot; the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares , which will not be for@@ warded to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmer continued to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of the fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann declared . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and agriculture . &quot;
&quot; for Peter White , too : &quot; best foods are produced . &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ farming ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables state support of wheat f@@ ences .
the aim is to maintain the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r recorded conveyor belt .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ jected area should not be able to be dis@@ able ( Hang@@ ing over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by hanging . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing b@@ illing project 2018 , the application of eight participants are running 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is now taking the Statue of Liberty
&quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , when they begin to attack statues . &quot;
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein &apos;s place on the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic ax@@ e in a heat dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN on the proposals to the dra@@ stic restriction of the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller does not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of bo@@ ilers and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have landed him if it had done it .
&quot; but he took their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta labeled : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go on a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which enlighten@@ ed the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but how it form@@ ulated it , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary response to the infl@@ amed words of Lazarus , the only one , in which a state not only invites any ancient immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; &quot; your gar@@ bage , your poor , and your arms , which are looking for , to breathe freely , / the ending waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ty waste &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he did not make sure that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who wanted to place their words after her death on the base - knew very good that it has been a high @-@ political action . &quot;
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ism , in which they presented the female em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom . &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and there is a very different name : mother of the ex@@ il@@ ants .
the association &apos;s connection with the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change that long before the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the big Schrei@@ er than Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty should invite you to bring the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward . &quot;
it should bear the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not ligh@@ ten the way into the United States .
pretty unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and a question of standing perception .
&quot; the great phant@@ as@@ ial effect of Lazarus was in it to see them as they had seen from the exhau@@ sting , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys to the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , the world is to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue says to them the words of hope , and of the will they hear . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch should not give the way to shine , but the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when just two s@@ ots of the UK belonged to the UK .
&quot; the performance of athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world champion is a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
black believes that &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we &apos;ll find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ tes - who was elected to Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was chosen from the team to the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is quite modest .
&quot; her cap@@ tive speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish , or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; passion and the genuine feeling , the E@@ ili@@ ie of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; is that 16 ch@@ ots are in the British crew . &quot;
&quot; the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle distances Mu@@ ir performs on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m running , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary games , should observe . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Sch@@ otte team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the team capit@@ alists says that they are &quot; enor@@ m@@ ously proud &quot; to the fact that many of their country@@ men do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also at the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; that is so special about the team of team to be in it , that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chosen me , making it something very special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I &apos;m very proud of all the jack@@ ets that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ des . &quot;
what my speech concerns about capitalist ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; therefore , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are again in the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it &apos;s just a great atmosphere there . &quot;
blocking Crit@@ ics via Facebook : do not work for a public office when you do not wear it from voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of its policy up to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sli@@ pped in criticism , safe . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of freedom can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we become like sheep for battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work on it to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and have deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties accused him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as a fri@@ v@@ ol , and the online commentary was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like H@@ og@@ an .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the second @-@ second approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary h@@ itz@@ head .
he has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence of the principles .
he was also very sk@@ ill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block of persons who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially called and of employees working with public tax @-@ dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , H@@ og@@ an spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse argu@@ ed the actions of the governor and argu@@ ed that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of trol@@ ls or chambers , or h@@ ass@@ hop@@ ed people that swing online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no sc@@ roll . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respec@@ tful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not benef@@ ited . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ ans &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ ass@@ orted , but she asked to hate speech . &quot;
&quot; I commented on pol@@ ite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current messages , &quot; she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if there is a number of people on the same subject , then they will be used by some more than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the governor as &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; would call others most likely &quot; inter@@ c@@ ere . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical heads and to burn , or to put protest@@ ers and to silence . &quot;
but exactly that happens now digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise that he has critic@@ ised Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they had a voters out of their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter p@@ ens hit his lead . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous T@@ roll .
&quot; the people who p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions , who crit@@ ici@@ zed his position on the contract of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put them silence .
&quot; freedom of freedom , opinion , and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept this .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; former Europeans No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope in the next three days of home comfort , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the final year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final round before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , joined the new venue for the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reached his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he placed this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous supporters of this game and is proud of its performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , though he has won in his 32 @-@ year career at the European Tour as well as at the European Tour Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open since she had won them in the year , after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who returned to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday in this year , returns to the next floor . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to make it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad about how it has gone .
&quot; with the Trio on the field , former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sch@@ ots on the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds at Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking at lung cancer . &quot;
the scientists from Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) came to this result in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are attributable to liabilities , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , he moved to a study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , 400 lung cancer cases have been given for passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
household closures are classified as a very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and &quot; are reas@@ onably priced at the time , &quot; says the head of the Building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground is much ver@@ tex , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which is always disabled for construction , represents a big problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers from red lights and lock@@ ers are already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the liner buses are entitled to drive .

if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i can cook the dinner they don &apos;t use a stove .
they even use a pot but rarely .
&quot; in their wood house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the shortened dum@@ b with ei@@ fri@@ es , un@@ washed hands are taken and swallowed . &quot;
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - it has no furniture - where she performs her daily work , such as clothes with cloudy water from the nearby S@@ ink . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , there were no fields assigned . &quot;
Poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , it may be too dangerous to work : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody wanted it to walk after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua New , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupation of the occupation . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which touched independence against the Dutch rule , turned rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province officially distributed in Papua and West Papua Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea &apos;s eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is so ab@@ ated as it is desert . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then another 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo f@@ ences surrounded by pl@@ ywood pieces , which were converted into different gel@@ b@@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few people have made their journey here , for journalists and practically no fore@@ igner . &quot;

there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to bear these clothing , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and indicates her lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves of our bodies . &quot;
Papua New Guinea &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold .
&quot; the biggest and profitable gold mine of the world , grass berg , owned by the Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort has dismant@@ led the value of 3.1 billion US dollars in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua New York City has an estimated 78 billion US dollars worth . &quot;
&quot; however , these wealth are a source of the elite for the Papua which ensure that Indonesia &apos;s most powerful military preser@@ ves a native presence . &quot;
a study of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort was paid for local military operations and units between 1998 and 2004 and $ 20 million in a single officer .
&quot; under the greater autonomy , Pap@@ u@@ anian demands thre@@ aten these golden g@@ ans and will be treated with gn@@ ashing . &quot;
&quot; according to activists , more than 500.000 Papua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped since 1969 from the Indonesian military , tortured and imprisoned . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970 @-@ year @-@ old Mass@@ es in Pap@@ u@@ as , in the 1970 @-@ he years , in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful protest@@ ers last year alone . &quot;
&quot; we will be able to destroy all things in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane , in the year 2016 , in reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal decline of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since every week inci@@ dents , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the screws have intensi@@ fied , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demo@@ graphic development is changing from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;

&quot; the Indonesian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the crowds and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua New Zealand during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total of 29 districts of Papua New Guinea , including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Papua New has changed little , and today the loc@@ als feel deceived . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that righteousness will be restored . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months to Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness . &quot;
the rock@@ ing children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a violation of her tone , and later came back with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fl@@ es , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then fired one of the soldiers into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so heavy that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire and the things escal@@ ates the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a football pitch before the local police station and the military audit@@ or centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried crushed hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ sigh@@ ting - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstr@@ ators started stones to police and military posts .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent to an order via an internal funk : &quot; if the masses have more than three times resistance , they shoot her dead , &quot; says it is not released in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the director of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called to rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot down in my left hand , &quot; &quot; he said TIM@@ E on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the rows of which were gathered here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ v was hit three times , his cousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and taught his body to make sure it was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es , who only bears a name , the TIM@@ E in a glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to secure their station , because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young protest@@ ers were killed and many injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura for the families of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of the victims . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case is immediately solved , so that there will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 that he set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for dis@@ closure of historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he said on June 5th in Jak@@ arta with TIM@@ E , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything will be regulated , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wir@@ anto , who demanded the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; against humanity , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were accused of human rights violations in Papua New Zealand , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated such claims with an un@@ break@@ age .
&quot; I was interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ an@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot dead . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai fear have to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was defeated by the military , after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sh@@ orts have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the vill@@ agers and the manager of a confession that refused to bring an un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others have been injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
un@@ controlled vill@@ agers protest@@ ing in front of the company &apos;s site .
&quot; the police said that the vill@@ agers cast stones on officers , which re@@ acted upon them by hum@@ idi@@ fying warning . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we have fear that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u B@@ adi@@ i who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last here were delivered quickly , the TIM@@ E was delivered . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to withdraw the officers of the army and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ ru@@ pture for the Indonesian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the tri@@ bal , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua New Guinea . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua Papua , causing spor@@ adic attacks and scre@@ enings of Indonesian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top @-@ O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai among them T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in response to the last few years , thousands of people were arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some dive never again .
&quot; among the people in Papua New Guinea , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for home . &quot;
bread is just out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each with four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
&quot; keep the bulk of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a consisted of just 10,000 indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Papua and the new migrants who have arrived in a larger number since the opening of new flight to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which are in the region , usually go to the better trained and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Papua New Guinea rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own company competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in the village ... because there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua New Guinea .
furthermore restrictions on coverage of international media remain ten@@ sion@@ ed .
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp became a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua New Guinea , although the rare permission was given to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ es electoral campaign , the restrictions on reporting to raise transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesian un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and Western pap@@ ua : visa ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
the lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Rights Council , the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting gallery . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha Nas@@ ir pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to hide the evidence for human rights accidents . &quot;
the people want to know that more foreign governments should take this knowledge .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has a further presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say they probably won &apos;t agree to Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the permanent threat of a mountain@@ ous military , is located in arm@@ aments and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua New Guinea , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they only want righteousness , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ breeding , families of Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ani , a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the dead of a victim was buried on a premises just opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they may know that they may never come to justice , but at least let them not forget the persons responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with direct head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire cap@@ tures the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai , and hundreds of residents , dating from 337 metres high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that appears in just two years by the high @-@ house , one is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we stood at the fire alarm , and at the scre@@ am of the people . &quot;
&quot; we crossed the steps down , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to come down , &quot; &quot; told a inhabit@@ ant who named George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais Civil Protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 P.@@ GMT ) , the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooling . &quot;
&quot; the government said , working on the provision of accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident may ask questions concerning the safety of materials , which are used in external areas of high places around the world . &quot;
&quot; a study by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by disgu@@ ise , the out@@ fit for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police , they believe that the system of plates in isolation and disgu@@ ise on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June to the rapid spread of a fire that could have contributed to about 80 people . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) is very pleased with his huge Davis Cup Cou@@ p during the Annual General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup , was not only supported on two numbers , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; although it is often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ sentence classi@@ cs remain the traditional value . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for the reform , the aim of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ g@@ ty , therefore only barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ g@@ ty . &quot;
you will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not only for the vote , however , before the vote , the proposal had come to place the final on a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right in the second round of the next round . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements will be facil@@ itated in items training places , etc . players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US trav@@ ellers bring items into the plane , find a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent are aware or un@@ consci@@ ously banned items to the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent , while they had entered the plane while acci@@ dentally banned knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed that they had been delayed , they would have travelled to amm@@ un@@ ing weapons , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted by more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers rather desp@@ ise the rules . &quot;
&quot; of the respondents , they gave that they have tried to fly with something that was forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the Generation X were . &quot;
the most common objects that were rolled by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents were carried out , while 2.2 percent of women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they would have been banned drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware had brought through the flight safety and how many things had been deliberately done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who wear s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - wis@@ ely or ignor@@ ant - through security , those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company indicates that the T@@ SA directives are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often uns@@ afe what liquids can take it or how much of it .
&quot; so , it is no surprise that the biggest quantity of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items are prohibited . &quot;
a time long thought people who T@@ SA could see books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla &apos;s customers
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; so far , he has under@@ min@@ ed that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always tri@@ ump@@ tions numbers , Tesla &apos;s boss El@@ on Mus@@ k , in addition to the announcement of recent quarterly balance , Tesla &apos;s CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the announcement of recent quarterly balance : the number of cancellations made in the new mass market @-@ model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k was often advert@@ ised with the more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery is just starting . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k dreamed : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn again . &quot;
critics have always noted that it is only a binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations can be ordered in any telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far around twelve percent of all orders may have to be a problem , however , Tesla &apos;s boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production page . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tesla delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year . &quot;
&quot; 2018 it is supposed to be all models - 500,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , more than 1800 reservations are currently available . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; at the earliest in the second half of 2018 with delivery - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never even in the practice tested production lines without bigger interru@@ ptions with maximum load capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but does it come to greater del@@ ays , then the inev@@ it@@ ability of the reservations could be used for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; then the company can &apos;t get un@@ satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of execution of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules on reducing emissions
&quot; a day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the environmental protection authority , to delay the implementation of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g causing air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his Agency proved to be the needs of government environmental authorities compared to previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mentioned the law@@ suit against his previous spot in a Federal Court of Appeal .
&quot; it &apos;s about a time limit , which ran on 1 October for states to hold the standards of 2015 for bott@@ om@@ o@@ zone o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he will carry out compliance with a year to study its authority over a year , to study the plan and to avoid the economic decisions in local decisions or economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time for reliable opponents , demanding environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block the regul@@ ators or to delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
sudden return from Wednesday is the most recent legal withdrawal for the P@@ ru@@ th@@ ening Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA contractor have exceeded his authority , as he tried to adopt the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitoring and reduction of methane le@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; in one of the Wednesday evening statement , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his revers@@ er at o@@ zone standard simply struck the read@@ iness of EPA to co @-@ operation with the states of the complex process of tim@@ ful@@ fill@@ ment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often has failed to carry out the dead@@ lines and then waiting for the execution of activists and other accused , and in an agreement to determine the date for execution , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation through trial procedures , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; however , the opinion of the EPA revealed that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; force to delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid politics and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ can Congress in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; a bill in the last month of approval , the implementation of the rules of 2015 should be delayed by at least eight years . &quot;
the intervention was not provided in the Senate .
&quot; the New York General At@@ tor@@ ney , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of the States , who had lam@@ ented the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - according to our pl@@ agues - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million Americans that are affected directly from the smo@@ g , who are located directly from Smo@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , on Sunday July 16 , at 16 : 30 at a ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether his idyl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors of the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z ser@@ en@@ ade can en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
the rescue and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the place have made friends and pat@@ rons of tum@@ ors to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique little i@@ od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle has been mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ ber@@ ian original customer book : Count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document according to the document , on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the beautiful parish church , a magnificent courtyard , belonged to the church or the patron saint , and not vice versa . &quot;
there were also people there .
&quot; as seen from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which today is still visible in the outskirts of Tum@@ ors , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the Royal Sett@@ lement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around 1600 sub@@ strate these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ aut was made out of the early medieval church law .
&quot; a master , who built a church built up and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also forgive this owner . &quot;
&quot; thus , the right to use a priest or bishop a new priest . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the size of the two zer@@ a at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell was then found in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window frames were inscri@@ bed and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
in 1796 French troops camp@@ ed in the vicinity of the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as a fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to overthrow 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead bodies . &quot;
18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demolished .
only the church storm left .
&quot; in the New Year of 1834 , a storm split the storm and half collapsed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent an evil , the tower was broken down . &quot;
only today &apos;s existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em takes care of the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen @-@ Rent@@ meister &quot; as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;

association wants to check permission from wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ aving itself , &quot; does not see legal requirements for the construction and therefore turned back to the rat . &quot;
&quot; the club &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim , &quot; has denied its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
they may be un@@ lawful .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , as at the time in Vier@@ sen merely there exists a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , the concentration zone also causes the wind power supply for the rest of the city area . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; savings of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; the town of Vier@@ sen had a few days earlier by a change in the area plan , a second wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but he didn &apos;t appro@@ ve the District Court of Düsseldorf , because of a form . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of planning legal requirements , the assumption was given a modest message after un@@ lawful and therefore again , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , president of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
current state of things : the city council again decided on the summer break in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; approval of the district government is still standing .
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; to this point , the issu@@ ance of approval for the construction of wind energy systems are excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the appropriate writing has been made since the last week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes it on the occasion to check the matter again .
&quot; however , it is expected to do that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the administrative court in the administrative court , the district court refused to express themselves content on Thursday with the argum@@ entation of the Society &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had been involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , at the age of 65 , with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy systems , the electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this corresponds to approximately one @-@ fifth of the power demand of all quad@@ sen@@ er households . &quot;
the NEW re will invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the past summer , four wind turbines were given green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor together : woman dies at terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident has happened at the Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between Nieder@@ gel@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two more persons were injured .
the state road remained blocked for hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the framework of the accompanying driver with their 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person to take the L 333 in direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers plan &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a@@ er and people from the region will discover the shops in the city centre in September .
the business association and the municipal authorities want to take advantage of the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants for the shopping spre@@ e into the city center .
&quot; as the chairman of the business one , Christian King , announced , the &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend will be sensitive to customers that offers its own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present their training places . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the shops of the city center will invite you to the &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night @-@ shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
there is not only one of the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , a internet video and printed bag that indicate the active weekend , Christian King . &quot;
municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the business association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; attraction centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and sold Sunday , talks with all commercial vehicles and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the zi@@ pper on parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ closed .
courses and tourists belong to this .
but many natives have lost the city centre in the shopping area .
&quot; at the end , all of them will contribute to anim@@ ate the city center - to rent the owners of the whole city and one . &quot;
&quot; it was given to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y with a network that made itself widespread , had said King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Stre@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Centers in Mühl@@ hausen , reported that five Thuring@@ ian cities were participating in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ ck@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Bl@@ eich@@ er@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should be stronger for the appreciation of local trade , and its meaning for the community of our cities are stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action under the spring management of the I@@ HK and with many partners are also clear that every citizen can affect its own direct environment .
two dead and several injured explosion at US @-@ Schule
&quot; while construction work , there came to a gas pipeline in the school building . &quot;

&quot; as Un@@ happy , the authorities suspected the authorities involved in a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; for the holiday period , only a few people held in the building of the Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump made after perme@@ ated tran@@ scription of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scription of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump challenged on a phone with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say openly that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President ruled him because he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall , and reported to him : &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t say the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware to pay Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first recru@@ itment with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ sion@@ ed exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. gy@@ bull said that a trade for the US refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; he would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p . &quot; after he had proposed a ban on refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call when he had said Mr. Gy@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury passed through a group of spectators at rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , the bridge was able to reach a group of white men with tissues in order to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle age in a needle @-@ suit - took a long train at his cig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
&quot; inside a row , the passengers in fear . &quot;
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; ro@@ oted the man .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; the silence , when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this aw@@ ful scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one neighbour . &quot;
&quot; but when a trap for the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience were very genuine si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Citi@@ zens came back to Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge to meet the night , in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one has been indicted for murder .
&quot; it is really un@@ question@@ able that in all those years , no one person was arrested , although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , who assi@@ sts in the organization . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt in a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; for him , the order is for action as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the Monroe community that an in@@ justice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want to pursue pro@@ secutions , we want healing , we want healing , but first we need to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a place of jurisdiction is a beg@@ ging of the dead one of the victims of the Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI files that were obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding fields were suspected of the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one has ever been indicted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions were always known throughout the city : Politics and Sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice gave the black citizens to Georgia in Georgia for the first time to vote their voice in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the choice st@@ ach according to the FBI of the FBI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett v@@ ester , during a struggle - supposedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said that rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby , which she bore , was not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when she went away from prison , the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b reached the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared the Mor@@ de and ordered , &quot; includes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution that was not only involved in the mor@@ den , the evidence and the identity of witnesses has failed . &quot;
Bro@@ oks form@@ ulates it even more likely .
&quot; it was a election law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed , to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual replica of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; her representation is illustr@@ ative , att@@ acking , and is justified in a kind of profound rac@@ ism that many believe he does not exist in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because we are confron@@ ted with its hem@@ or@@ ality in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production started in June , and on the first day , almost 30 actors , a dozen white and the rest of black - in a room and noisy , when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ contained overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here an old co @-@ director .
&quot; he played the role of the boss C@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story on life , because we don &apos;t want to return to those days . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room check the actors Dar@@ ri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nice H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the h@@ ester cri@@ es and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Oh , he w@@ asted away from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a re@@ jects the fire .
there is a break .
and then everybody breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the most loud .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; Ras@@ con@@ a asked . &quot;
he is al@@ ar@@ ming and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Gre@@ ene said , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; yet , &quot; funny one of the other black actors . &quot;
&quot; you have to make only the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and precisely , the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ er@@ hood replaces the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts even once .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , kis@@ ses and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , clothed with a funeral dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads cheap Holidays &quot; Strange Fru@@ it &quot; . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks out with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught silence and tears out of the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as corro@@ sive moisture when Bro@@ oks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tomb of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point the murders have stayed a an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels donated . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes sound out of the song , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and inspec@@ t the dead name . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cks on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after some minutes Gre@@ ene ow@@ es the amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ we@@ dge and wi@@ pe her tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ im@@ pover@@ t Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suit who played the C@@ lan@@ member . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ced two of his players and then breaks into their arms together with emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is okay , whis@@ pers one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up the actors together with the actors .
&quot; in a table , a white pair of Atlanta is excited about the order with a black pair , which they have just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski fought therefore to find words , which has left the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear this terrible words and deeds ... of people who look like you , and they do that , because they look like it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does that really do with me , let me believe that Lyn@@ chen still continues , &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today , it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks , located at his table , he eats and rec@@ alls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the order is inspiring in a certain way , because it describes the terror of what we bear , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s so , if we learn nothing , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t know his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ us@@ ement &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monum@@ ental work , Director Frank Cast@@ orf is reli@@ eved on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging of gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the rotation stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ out street corner with the wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car race , in which the Rhine @-@ bre@@ eder as a rock@@ ers , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; oil painting remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ leit@@ v - Money , power and gre@@ ed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ bre@@ eders - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner , as well as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she missed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood Man@@ ier a dead body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious fi@@ ese Hagen that surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal the scene when he proposes Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still needs to believe .
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who is modest and the hands to the Merkel @-@ cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
great appl@@ ause is available for the festival orchestra which shows the first time on stage - in view of the large heat again in le@@ ak leisure .
&quot; with tension , the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am was expected . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent pipe concert about himself in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; Ru@@ fe had under@@ gone . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ haus Katharina Wagner is likely to be happy about this .
&quot; it is noted that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in a certain way , she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with cast@@ orf , but it was also a understanding of its sight . &quot;
I draw a positive result .
Max amounts works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture shop , once in the week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked in the open whole day at school .
how are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have different people to do with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ term volunteer . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I made SL@@ C .
&quot; and then another study of construction , we have to say successfully . &quot;
&quot; I know for me , that it is a groove and I want to do something different to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is locally , in the burning point , perhaps , really . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I &apos;ve collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I &apos;m going to study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social worker and studying in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the volunteer service to have several different applications ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always comes on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from the age of home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also in the O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
it was exactly the right thing for me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
unlike the construction engineer ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it &apos;s not about to calculate stati@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; it always has other people in front of the head , each with a different story behind . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee , whether a youth who has been picked up out of the family - you must always go individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you don &apos;t have a touch @-@ care ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
it is a range that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but that &apos;s life . &quot;

&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul . &quot;
&quot; in an opinion of NATO , it was done to be the explosion on Thursday night , when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by one &quot; of people carried out impro@@ vised . &quot;
the statement says that all injured in a stable condition and in the US military hospital at the airport of Bag@@ ram will be treated .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing force of the Taliban and the group known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian victims in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kabul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country , since the US led troops led by power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence highlights the pre@@ dic@@ ular security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump de@@ ferred the number of U.S. troops to raise the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ raf Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule to Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay the Obama government &apos;s government regulation , according to which the states are obliged to em@@ ulate the Smo@@ g @-@ induced emissions . this was a day after 15 States accused the agency because of the step@@ ping def@@ endants . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said she &apos;ll show the commitment of the agency , working with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we react to our state partner , &quot; &quot; said EPA Chef Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in June , P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which a part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions should be determined to determine where deposits should be made in order to delay thin air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday , and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to rec@@ la@@ ve a wide range of environmental impacts , which is imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the set@@ back of the Democrats and nature groups that worry about the effects of larger emissions to public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that the in@@ hale of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; lung function and rein@@ force the respiratory symptoms &quot; as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants to be shared lounge
&quot; at the end the decision was clear : with two opponents , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ner decides the establishment of a common area in the future senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in front of the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing basic part was signed , Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until now , until so far the church community is owned in the community of ownership , but there is no planning stage for the project by a private investor &apos;s project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the church .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters of space available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the council is floating in front of such a common room not as a meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ oral righteous living , but openly in the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ cafe &quot; made the turn . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by provision of funds for the current budget in the previous autumn , was carried out by funding . &quot;
the building is located in the san@@ itation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision was given to sign@@ alize the investor that , in this regard , no dum@@ pl@@ ets want to throw between the legs , which is close to the ambient temperature , as well as the roof @-@ level - what the tr@@ ash height reduces and the construction of economic power - are possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried sole , is this addition . &quot;
if it helps : unanimously he happens the body .
it is not as easy as a common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many own buildings , with which one should not go right now , and now they rest in the common room from the window , says : &quot; I do hard to do with that . &quot; &quot;
Y@@ vonne Sta@@ iger speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
she sees behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y of oh@@ si@@ in assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not give a net , but get a real , in a branch @-@ in @-@ case , is the counter speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ ers petition , pursuant to the resolutions , finds three fears . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opponents in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller that summar@@ ises : &quot; if we set up the decision , we make a huge step away , a giant hole in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : Rad@@ ler is mounted on road
&quot; while crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was hit by a car and was severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police attacked , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was at 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bicycle on the bicycle route of the Black Sea road from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road@@ way at the height of the street at the Buch@@ hol@@ zer bush .
one in the same direction of the passenger car driver granted him pre@@ ten@@ tion .
&quot; as the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove on the road , however , he was obviously not proud of the counter@@ traffic . &quot;
he pushed together with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was enlighten@@ ed onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought with a hospital in a hospital .

&quot; for five defe@@ ats in the past six test , An@@ cel@@ otti made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is balance in the team . &quot;
the last was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great trust that my team shows this qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the Du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans in their B@@ ann .
&quot; the game is sold with 8@@ 1.@@ 360 spectators , the German soccer league ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the resin of star to Stern , hiking &quot;
&quot; in Har@@ z , the nationwide first &quot; star trail &quot; is to be created . &quot;
this is planning the club Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet away in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; Stern@@ en@@ pf@@ ad &quot; come to the information needs of many hard visits .
&quot; he connects nature , science , movement and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to exhibit along the planned route boards and inform about stars and stars .
&quot; in the first phase to 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; well @-@ able installations to five to six places &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; qu@@ en@@ qu@@ ire St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tables are to be added to the Internet .
therefore the site plays a good mobile network reception .
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
later the star trail was to be extended by train .
&quot; for example , the viewer experience plenty of knowledge worth knowing about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star was stronger than another , even though he was much further away . &quot;
&quot; may also be convey@@ ed , in which constellation can find a selected star and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , located at the highest located ob@@ servatory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of National Park , Har@@ z National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ me@@ da galaxy is clearly visible with the naked eye .
&quot; since 2003 , in the university town there has been something similar to the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , a somewhat similar to the planned ast@@ er@@ wer@@ - the planet . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , leads up to Hain@@ berg and to the ob@@ servatory - as well as a &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ emar@@ den ( Municip@@ ality track ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the sticks with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ plan@@ ed Plu@@ to at the end point - are exactly positioned in the distance and a scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun measures approximately 75 meters away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from Sun to Plu@@ to is about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour to the St@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the world .
the march to the next fixed stern but would last half a year .

Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia that should stand in a coll@@ ision course to capture the most exciting boxing struggle in the near future of 147 pounds for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ protected world Bo@@ xing Council light weight champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ fe@@ at Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through a stim@@ ulated decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , both fighters members of the top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;

&quot; I am a former spring weight , remin@@ ded Garcia . &quot;

four Publ@@ ishers to T@@ ire plat@@ ters
&quot; during an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16.@@ 30 a.m. shortly before the market place , probably after a ty@@ re @-@ plat@@ ter , the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger car dra@@ gged on the right into the vill@@ agers , where he over@@ threw himself and then lying on the roof of the grave . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the past by the ambul@@ ance service , A7 went towards the north for about one hour , then the traffic could be passed on the left side of the accident . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; rotating chain is better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann , after the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener in Braunschweig , hopes the optim@@ isation of def@@ enses in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first seasonal play , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , they would not have the two opponents during the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two areas too much , and we have to fit in Au@@ e even better , &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Erz@@ gebirge , the dirt chain should also be optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a free stum@@ bling block , the Fort@@ un@@ ae don &apos;t want to learn more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no longer represents Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew , even after the experiences in preparation with the rotating chain , is better than with the fourth chain . &quot;
&quot; not yet , I don &apos;t know how we can inter@@ act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ helm Fun@@ cle , but Hoffmann is safe to build on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up well . &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ize and we do not afford so many of the mistake . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ sive start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we can concentrate on Sunday with four points and on Sunday , we will certainly speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
he wanted to know his coach nothing .
&quot; the start in the season was only after six to eight game days , &quot; &quot; Fried@@ helm Fun@@ cle , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e , just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; now they can begin the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ cle and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might even be a bit of fresh , since they could not have a heavy and complete game such as Fort@@ una for a rise @-@ up fav@@ ors in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the in@@ def@@ ender of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; indeed , guests from the Rhineland go as a lightweight Favor@@ it on Sunday to the En@@ counter ( almost ) finished stadium from Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take away it , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ cle , whose balance is quite positive in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must propose from the mor@@ row , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Head coach . &quot;
&quot; such statement would be meet arro@@ gant and excessive . &quot;
and so Fun@@ kel will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which were subjected to a new method for medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( puzzle of puzzles ) has begun with the implementation of tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they are supposed to be more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration of mig@@ r@@ ations ) has been critic@@ ised because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , mig@@ r@@ ations has shipped 6,@@ 880 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older , while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency reported that the person was 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old .
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is asked .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constant during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases , in which the person was evaluated as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers has been lied about its age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that the &quot; propose that the person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet found out the results of the 5@@ 81 , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had spoken to the person that she will be 18 years old . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in the X @-@ ray recordings of knee @-@ teeth and MRI recordings are analyzed , which are then analyzed by dent@@ ist and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a sk@@ ep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work has to see the assessment of biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than usual through the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot;
&quot; to assess the biological age in this way , it is very un@@ reliable . &quot;
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to assess a child as an adult is in@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is in it , if the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven ton of heavy concrete was installed at the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , building manager at the Department of Transport and Transport at the Government of Government Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at all three sanitary needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and is safe to keep the tim@@ etable .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a arch bridge of concrete , which is dressed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , they have come into the years now . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and transport security , the three construction works will be thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges run over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built by red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach now has a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap on Wednesday morning .
&quot; this is an edge fixing , which is also used as a mode of operation . &quot;
&quot; at the southern part of the bridge , a 2,@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap should be used on Friday . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
&quot; the special thing is , it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
special finger@@ tips has the installation of pipes through the construction work in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass fibre cable , which many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; in advance , the residents were informed about the project through the project . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , fish and cru@@ st@@ ac@@ eans had to be drained . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building building and the collective direction towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of three fires , together with 700 000 euros . &quot;
it is funded by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest at German potato salad
&quot; it does not occur so often that parties must move on a strand , but if it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties of volcanic erup@@ tions ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell , according to the poster &quot; large election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who is together with Alexander Gau@@ land , the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are in front of the event before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ collectors , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city pic@@ nic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking place below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a bun@@ ch picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum One World and one of the relevant organis@@ ers , really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ ian potato salad which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problem , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police arrested many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic erup@@ tions reported that he wanted to make such an event and have received the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of which already built Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces . &quot;
&quot; so , the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot;
&quot; he says , &quot; &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock in the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ es@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , including the Rhineland @-@ pf@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall , about 200 listeners that are waiting for the top channel of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy head of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch will hold their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the police force remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than one hour , the Af@@ D event takes a longer breath , but also there is a longer breath there after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can turn off - no particular occurr@@ ence .
trombone hits trumpet
&quot; a re @-@ listen to Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ onist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , in the row of Has@@ l@@ acher monastery concerts , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ro@@ sla@@ v Pet@@ kov there is a concert among the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ fol@@ klore &quot; meets with roots in the brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winner and awar@@ dees of numerous international competitions and have held Sol@@ op@@ os@@ positions in European nick@@ name .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is a solo@@ ist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combines the lust , not just to exceed the limits on their instruments , but also to mer@@ ging the boundaries of different gen@@ res . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach introduces the two as in a new look , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music &quot; combines classical fol@@ klore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the Jazz@@ ech@@ op@@ rei@@ aster N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical music , jazz and the free games to a fascinating art works . &quot;
this core piece of the program was premiered in this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
&quot; the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ino has written it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church , with its particular acou@@ stics , is deliberately involved in the concert . &quot;
Kri@@ sten Stewart speaks about her bis@@ exual
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and will eat it until the end of her life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , so Kri@@ sten Stewart is openly about their bis@@ exual . &quot;
&quot; when I add into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what is next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood @-@ stars was that of their &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally went bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone , whom I &apos;ve got . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten had said that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived in du@@ alism and believed seriously . &quot;
so it has never confused or disabled .
&quot; I never liked it , not seriously . &quot;
&quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time they prefer like a book : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children , I would look like a b@@ b . &quot;
I felt really attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and remember me : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public they don &apos;t like to love her love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way , and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; maybe you may call me some more than und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify themselves before the whole public . &quot;
the Governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you with many prayers and much ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it is at the time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement before the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice won &apos;t be the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Forbes states that he possesses Kohl@@ em@@ ins in five states , and have inherited a carbon store from his father . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday night in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with just 15 Gou@@ vern@@ s and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , ongoing message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel said in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping scandal
&quot; the worldwide head of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday , which he described as an open exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping scandal , but he repeated it was not the moment to be taken into the country again . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics @-@ boss Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ ht@@ in said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics World Championships that it was correct to combat his country from the sport and that he decided to fight D@@ oping .
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those in competitions gold and silver medals were cut off . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the prohib@@ itions that was executed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found on state @-@ sponsored D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized themselves , that she has experienced some pretty hot times , and everything will be done to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; CO@@ E said , &quot; &quot; pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very con@@ structive day , and I think that progress has been achieved , but the Congress does not support the recommendations of the Task Force , that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we must do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle of principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the withered system , &quot; &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will start at the Athletics World Championships that will begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still in@@ adequate and forbidden trainer are still free , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral for Mali @-@ based soldiers
&quot; during a funeral service in the North @-@ edi@@ cal fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were shot at a helicopter type in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high safety measures .
the Secretary of Defense Secretary of Defense Ursula from the Le@@ yen ( CDU ) said nothing .
but they called the two pilots as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist . &quot;
&quot; we bow ahead of this highest sacrifice , which they had established in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old st@@ aff@@ er from Nord@@ h@@ essen had come to life on Wednesday before a week in West African Mali .
her s@@ är@@ ge was transferred to Germany and accompanied by a mur@@ derer from the German Armed Forces in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives took place in the Church . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral in the district of the family , eng@@ ster friends , from representatives of the federal government and politics . &quot;
&quot; among them , H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the general practition@@ er of the German Armed Forces Volker Wie@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ ds laid hands on ro@@ ses , the families were arm in arm in arms . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ ed and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
the Minister of Defence of Le@@ yen described the evacu@@ ated soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and crushed .
&quot; in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , the por@@ be@@ headed tiger was built in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regime which belong to the soldiers , stated : &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , there was no mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali was not a Minister of Le@@ yen : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high meaning &quot; for a country , from which we are separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the s@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are att@@ acking , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried in his wife next to his wife . &quot;
this divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard built a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen would agree with the decision of her husband &apos;s decision .
&quot; where Prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be un@@ clear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never done a H@@ eh@@ l of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ ott@@ le of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
in 2016 he retired as well as the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and the function he wanted to see himself against his wife , but not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the Head of the Danish King &apos;s house . &quot;
where the final resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be un@@ clear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; the native Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French Embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had always joined the Dan@@ ger in his almost 50 year old reg@@ att@@ itudes among the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik about the first years in Denmark : &quot; few months after my arrival , everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was pregnant , I prefer wine instead of beer , silk str@@ ing@@ les instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I would like to smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco , which I could have the call to be the brand of Social Intel@@ lec@@ tuals , I could not hope . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid new election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of red @-@ green government majority , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is rec@@ alled after the loss of red @-@ green government majority , but he doesn &apos;t want to re@@ sign up . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke to the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising student suffered from a green @-@ dep@@ uties in Lower Saxony &apos;s government in Lower Saxony &apos;s government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country code , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ed its step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in its election circuit in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hannover . &quot;
CDU Group President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend it to his group .
&quot; thus , CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the regional State Parliament , SPD and Gre@@ et 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was vice versa .
the new Land@@ tag will be voted on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ick@@ ler told the red @-@ green state government to decide whether they could continue in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Weil stops it , however , that the country day conclu@@ des quickly his self @-@ resolution solution . &quot;
the CDU faction will probably decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
the state version also sees the opportunity that the State of Ministers of the Prime Minister is advis@@ able and cho@@ oses a successor .
&quot; our constitution offers multiple options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally checked properly , &quot; said Th@@ ick@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally aud@@ ited . &quot;
Th@@ ick@@ ler called T@@ West &apos;s step &quot; but something cur@@ os . &quot;
the political scientist himself emphas@@ ized : &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very well . &quot;
they described themselves as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ ran@@ s@@ ary dep@@ uties for the return of their country day .
&quot; we are of course , of course , that she has received their country day that she has received over the green regional list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; the state @-@ President met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner shared with immediate effect . &quot;
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ als . &quot;
she deliberately decided to lead no pron@@ unci@@ ation in the faction .
&quot; even before the background that there was no in@@ corporate differences , we cannot re@@ prove this step . &quot;
&quot; member of the SPD law candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the down@@ fall of the Eastern Green Party of El@@ ke , on the CDU as betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of Red @-@ Green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the Social Democrats on Friday on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re@@ sign the country tag quickly .
the outlet T@@ west@@ ens is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in her injured E@@ it@@ el@@ iness and her personal interests in her fru@@ strations , the SPD Secretary @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus crit@@ ici@@ zed their personal interests . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ um game and tries to beat out of this political capital .
&quot; CDU of the CDU Group President Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ick@@ ler wants to recommend his dep@@ uties , El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to the CDU . &quot;
&quot; the Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets , with personal career thinking the result of the 2013 country @-@ election 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was at that time before the SPD &apos;s strongest force , SPD and Green had a hau@@ gh@@ ty majority of a voice . &quot;
&quot; agriculture minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from pois@@ oning , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over contam@@ inated eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
business Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves before pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumer and consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stress pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states representing the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even though , after all , we know what we currently know , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis action - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is not really perceived ? &quot;
the food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has stopped immediately and has since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s involvement in the close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available for consumers .
&quot; the trade , just like the manufacturer to worry , that the selling products are transport and health are un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if in case of eggs of the resi@@ du@@ es of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not able to transport . &quot;
&quot; un@@ loaded eggs , however , can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time we are not to blame for this time .
are manufacturing plants and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after running , the production plants meet no immediate guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they have to calculate the economic practices of services with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal intern@@ ships . &quot;
as always there is too little control .
is it only missing on the staff or also to the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls which have uncovered the process . &quot;
&quot; the truth also belongs to the truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be reduced to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ over to the State Bar in cases where crimes can be pre@@ valent , of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times already , that I expected to expect the responsible authorities by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to receive safe and traffic food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de in the food industry is used , consumer and consumers are right . &quot;
&quot; by the ge@@ aring means , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are present in a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ ft@@ il is not acceptable in the attitude of life @-@ medi@@ ary animals and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
it must be reli@@ ed consistently with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; I expect from all the relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is gro@@ c@@ ely and dissolved . &quot;
how the financial rules of football on Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to Paris to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aims to prevent un@@ interrupted issues of European football , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences are coming to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEFA , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to offer teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were called by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to point out some point , that the transfer of Ne@@ y@@ mar was financed without big losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ( 262 million $ ) to purchase the Brazi@@ lians from his contract , and Ne@@ y@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to more than ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money loose with safety , making Ne@@ y@@ mar , and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply much money for the acquisition of players much money , but must be able to control the Bre@@ ak @-@ even point in their jobs on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini to its election to the UEFA president in 2007 .
&quot; former French player believed that clubs , who had enormous debt in their stri@@ ving after success , had been effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and risk to ru@@ in@@ ct when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P abandoned its concentration to the liabilities of their losses on the supervision of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , Roman Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich was originally bought in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then strongly invested in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ old FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini dropped from the presidency in Un@@ g@@ nade , his UEFA @-@ successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be found out of excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; certainly is FF@@ P not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA Press in the last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ y@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ y@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the deposits will be issued for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was reduced from € 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members will take place for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; the UEFA is searching for clubs who could try to over@@ lay their financial views , associated with companies that are connected to the owners of a clubs . &quot;
&quot; while a cataly@@ tic company could spontaneous the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship should not exceed the standard market rates , the UEFA should not be considered legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
exactly that happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ship was blo@@ wn out of the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G Pay@@ ments in Ne@@ y@@ mar could come to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have fought that Ne@@ y@@ mar Championship Ambassador will be just to find out and a der@@ ar@@ able man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA regulatory authorities . &quot;
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA is still attentive to pay any attempt to avoid the rules .
&quot; the UEFA had no prepared conversations with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who tru@@ sts with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anony@@ m@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were unable to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of € 54@@ 2.4 million with a turnover of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars arrive a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
the association goes from that sales increase by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated , one of the best football player to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ m@@ ars way@@ way to prevent the PS@@ G viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financed D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding cat@@ ars the last owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e W@@ enger , whose association is owned by American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of the football in the last 15 years , &quot; said W@@ enger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial Fair@@ play , because you can see different ways or have different interests when a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants .
&quot; in recent years , Chocol@@ ates Fre@@ y on @-@ board chocolate made for the Swiss . &quot;
now the kis@@ ses collaboration stood before a possible end : the airline writes the order .
Swiss speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schwei@@ z &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to recent planning , Air@@ line will close a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked all two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
some 17 million small rot@@ ated plates of 14 grams are spread over the passengers per year before landing at passengers .
&quot; over the cost , Swiss doesn &apos;t want any information . &quot;
&quot; the order volume estimate the order volume according to &quot; North West Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 @-@ 2 million Swiss francs - a turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the promotional effect : for a ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants it is a prestigious mission .
&quot; like many applicants in the new call , Swiss will not betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot;
but in question only Swiss manufacturers are coming .
&quot; according to the newspaper article , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the treaty on spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate boards spread the Swiss since 2006 on board of their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was delivered in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , led Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long distance flights , customers of first class with treats from the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumps was spo@@ iled , in the business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on the short route , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi is distributed by Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y , both in Business and Economy Class . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repet@@ ition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ era ( when the pioneer David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ ste@@ er the Sk@@ etch @-@ Kom@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Ban@@ ks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural ar@@ act , it is equally a par@@ ody and a em@@ bo@@ diment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; however , as Franchise feels it , the time would be short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained a original story for a speaking tin of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the G@@ ags - actor mid @-@ age , children play children who will grow up - they are unable to win the im@@ possibility of winning the last part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who play adults now , is less emotional ro@@ oted and its par@@ ody is more after the fo@@ undry principle , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ year @-@ old like &quot; The Hand That the cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; a character by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line sk@@ ates and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ er ) , now Roman@@ aut@@ or , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ ility still .
&quot; and there is still another crazy @-@ mal@@ ign@@ ant plot , in which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ ste@@ wards ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses of the best part of Franchise fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the ever young Mr. Rud@@ d , the Matt D@@ avi@@ lions sub@@ li@@ pp@@ le of &quot; singles &quot; shows , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random mad@@ ness that could heat this fran@@ chise , like a sort of repet@@ itive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches what I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; &quot; will visit how to visit the movie &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : on the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; at the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onda &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ west ring campaign . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ edy TV series by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka is a director with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , ath@@ e@@ ism and the way of Marx@@ ism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard car@@ rot Gregor , and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i , whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tracks to see ( the police is making the time to view chess in television as Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous spokes@@ man - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - provides a decent game &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drummer - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask , is involved - it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes it is gone , and com@@ edy is not fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been viewed on a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could be better to deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re , since Gregory and I@@ os@@ ef always occupied the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who will devour a he@@ ap of ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything to food for a age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with her husband .
blow against Drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the Black Ba@@ ar Circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , were searched for numerous objects such as the public prosecutor Kon@@ stanz on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 patients aged 25 and 77 were arrested and issued arrest warran@@ ts against these arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials placed larger amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the same Raz@@ or in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
these two will probably be extra@@ d@@ ited to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 police officers were used . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia is accused of drug crimin@@ ality , severe violence , seeking murder and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s public prosecutor determined the prosecution against organised drug dealers in the southern German room . &quot;
&quot; between the State Bar in Constance and Palermo , a real exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil have almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the major deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Italian citizenship is involved with regard to Italian Mafia . &quot;
&quot; the case was also fired on May 27 in the hips , at which early in the morning several shots were fired in a restaurant , should go into account of the gang . &quot;
&quot; way , great g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner @-@ register lam@@ ents &quot;
&quot; according to data from citizens who should not emerge , &quot; according to a report the foreigners register in Germany has significant defects in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partly grave decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to media report by the Federal Government of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a media report according to a media report . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings at the registered data could result in asylum procedures and deportation . in an analysis , in an analysis , in an analysis , the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are ten million people with foreign nationality , including approximately 5.7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been maintained , the data quality in parts have not been well maintained . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; of people who have long been longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and are actually no longer immer@@ sed in the register . &quot;
&quot; in@@ correct data charges can considerably slow return processes , &quot; says the report on it . &quot;
&quot; in statistics on out @-@ out people , these EU citizens do not refer to the EU citizens . &quot;
&quot; such false assign@@ ments resulted in &quot; &quot; a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with &quot; &quot; means &quot; in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government apparently began to withdraw refugee families with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy if they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is , from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) , the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ran@@ er Zeitung &quot; reports . &quot;
&quot; in the paper , it is said that B@@ AM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1st June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , the newspaper under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Convention , the EU State is responsible for refugees to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; when a mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send him back into the travelers . &quot;
&quot; for the grounds , the Office now write : &quot; in the meantime , the admission capacity for families with under@@ age children has increased substantially in Italy . &quot;
Italy has submitted for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) keep this promise for sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees in the context of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Bundestag in the Bundestag , Ul@@ la Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened because of defects in the Italian asylum system . &quot;

the Bank of England is holding interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation have vacc@@ inated the spec@@ ulation about a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; contracts , &quot; when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a reinforced pressure . &quot;
&quot; the Bank &apos;s policy makers ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with this month fewer members have an increase in this month , as the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly annual report , the Bank reduced its growth progn@@ osis for 2017 at 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that pressure on the budget would continue to rise to almost 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but they realized that in the next years Zin@@ ser@@ ene threats would be necessary to cultiv@@ ate the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the lending cost would possibly be expected to climb to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also voted to withdraw a part of Mamm@@ ut economic stimul@@ us , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for financial plan , in order to provide budget for banks in order to provide more than 15 billion pounds more in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central progn@@ osis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , because the pressure on the real income of households continued to consumption . &quot;
&quot; for interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ lications of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent would be required as the markets expect . &quot;
markets projected the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; would be made . &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth rates for this and next year , 1.9 % and 1.7 % were predicted compared to the Bank &apos;s forecast . &quot;
it has retained its growth progn@@ osis to 1.8 % in 2018 .
&quot; the pound fell after these messages , opposite the dollar and the euro . &quot;
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appointing growth , increasing expectations have increased to a interest rate and increased GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is slightly re@@ covering after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the latest inflation report offered a little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ term sal@@ aries , as the contamination first is even worse before they will improve . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years could not prevent the income of income , &quot; but they added that wages for the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; can be recover . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ unds which is compens@@ ated for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes to a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the coup . &quot;
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years , until this will complete the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the end of the Bank to interest rates , the call was increased after a interest rate , since inflation increased pressure on harsh households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected to put on again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the surplus in relation to their goal of 2 % is to be &quot; completely &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ verd@@ ant , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ al &apos;s Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest back@@ drop of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market should again be more competitive , as the credit@@ or would like to end in positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks especially good for those who close the existing De@@ als and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) should rub controversial HIV drug 10.000 people
&quot; in September , after a battle against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS , patients will have access to a &quot; trans@@ forming &quot; HIV pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one before sexual intercourse recorded pre@@ ex@@ foli@@ ation @-@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can decrease the inf@@ ancy risk of high risk assessment by around 86 percent , now comes from health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he declared ready to finance the trial , after the Appeals Court confirmed the verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice in which the N@@ HS had to pay attention to the Pr@@ EP despite the asser@@ tion that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the announced chess train was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon Stev@@ ens , as an important new intervention , during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be one of the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ to@@ rop@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection .
Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of one person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for the treatment in question , gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified to agree with the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who controls a partner whose HIV status is not known by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people who live in England and registered at a domestic doctor may also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , which are collected in a large scale , and implemented in a large scale . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should add the extensive and increasingly successful effort to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of persist@@ ing progress in the forests of one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive of the NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted specifically to needy and endangered people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , which leads to improve many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Terror of Terror Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority has to be done quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was given , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Sha@@ dows @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ itated implementation by the government . &quot;
evidence shows how trans@@ forms this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the advantages of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the end of HIV in society a step closer &apos; . &quot;
life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , resi@@ zed in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne un@@ packed her bags and sold .
&quot; before , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I have loved it in love and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room estate with a scre@@ wed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; to this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi made from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge in it was to create a mezzanine which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the steel plant is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked on each other , without leaving us . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about to build a simple platform , but to put the steel so that he had the right height or below the right height . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan , place two rooms in full height , with a lot of additional drama . &quot;
for the mezzanine looks a classic copper light windows of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us via the gl@@ am@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lights set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work it longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the refle@@ ctor feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for all the corner and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; due to perception of a gl@@ am@@ orous noise , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
so special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the st@@ ahl@@ enh@@ ancing , fear@@ ful MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it &apos;s when you push the door on the door , very easily g@@ low . &quot;
&quot; thanks to cle@@ ver@@ able use of space and storage room , Jo@@ anne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or like your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary form , a real estate ma@@ sts will enter and perform calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they made it to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high @-@ quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional ties into a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment itself can transform itself through a good design and increased square @-@ number of something standard@@ ly into something incredible .
&quot; in fact , how Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers strug@@ gling for a $ 500 million real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family established the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation for one of the greatest real estate imperialist Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developers Colin De Lut@@ is lives in a Villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clari@@ fy how their property and its assets should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp con@@ frontation over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half billion dollars , since the family has purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood family since 1973 . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co je@@ ans family established there and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler and shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father , Colin is described as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lut@@ is family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a trial states that this means Colin is owned by the value of 316 million dollars and Paul in the value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a pro@@ w@@ emp@@ t point .
&quot; the story of Colin proposed is leaving him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first affair in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place last Friday . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now strug@@ gling for control over the existing business - what Colin , as Paul claims it is excluded . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but thro@@ ws Paul before , to manage some owners . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Colin , he says he will trust the battle . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , emails , and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and by both sides . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , operated in the late 1950 &apos;s and served a business in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the safety to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Colin opened the first je@@ ans of the family .
Colin says he began West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoping to pass their possession to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to land the Brotherhood before the court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lut@@ is Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark had been paid by the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin has kept himself very back even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire of the best friend of television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers contact .
&quot; only Colin answered by SMS to say &quot; I can really say much , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to complain of our family names by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would have not wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; Colin wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of new chief of Staff plans to limit the media Ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if yes , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the information flow on President Tr@@ ump , including reports of news media - in hope to keep the boss on an even greater course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , joined his first working day with leading employees , he introduced a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information that fall into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump , performing its media coverage . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship to television is enough for decades - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when Can@@ didate was off@@ ended due to an un@@ fair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that was to convince the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February , opposite the POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption has a ste@@ ady praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom ever &quot; was &quot; under control &quot; is ridicul@@ ous .
perhaps these combat agents don &apos;t know anything we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twe@@ ets have included even more ignition material without their interventions yet .
we will probably learn something about Twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump is not sent .
&quot; if his employees create it a few times , trouble of him , then their efforts have landed . &quot;
&quot; but no one has to prevent it consistently , that Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy is called . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem exists in that human beings are present in a white house , which will always try to present their own agenda by using tr@@ ump material that promotes its views from the world . &quot;
&quot; with this story , POL@@ IT@@ ICO has been dealing with this story - in May about the pre@@ ference of the adviser , the President of strategic reasons desper@@ ate information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , described by reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press coverage , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he would come out to find out where these origin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone accused a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of his le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;

Tr@@ ump read the article and began to ask people about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; in addition , Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage the paper kra@@ de and docum@@ enting the tr@@ ump . &quot;

&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still aiming to influence . &quot;

&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the people will pray and hop@@ ed . &quot;
the police in all Europe will be shipped in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous crimin@@ als on the escape .
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ de@@ crimin@@ als are not known , not@@ ices of the population is hop@@ ed and worship . &quot;

&quot; 36 of the online news could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them are due to release following the release on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers take action on a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; Million@@ aire Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est household owners of West Mid@@ lands are once again negotiated with some un@@ sealed travelers on the foot of war , which is one of the congregation of zo@@ omed gr@@ um@@ ina to rec@@ la@@ ve a field before their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ hull which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire series . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and a army of transportation , after being released only in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated dit@@ ch , to prevent their fail@@ ures . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ full group found a gap in the defense systems and pressed their vehicles by a section that remained un@@ ham@@ mer@@ ed to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , saying that it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are going on Monday night , after being sent out of Bentley Heath , where stones were thrown onto the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced into action in fact , as he was using the problem with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the traveler were there in May , were moved and are now back again . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to make it possible , in order to protect your parks in order to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to pay my municipal dest@@ iny if the Council can &apos;t stop it once .
&quot; a resident who would not be called , said : &quot; it is ridicul@@ ous , we just saw the last round of this traveler just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area .
&quot; the Council of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ fu@@ elled camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we seize the necessary legal steps so quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our exercise collection , it is very important that as many residents notify an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation , in which the judgment must check when we propose our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the then ambi@@ ance of the hotel mbH , on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights per year were lost and also revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , the hotel building , which was offered in the district , offered the hotel building to the Land@@ rat@@ co estate , which took place for controversial discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of an construction plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
&quot; but above all , Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts , Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and spoke at that time of serious interested people at the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ Hotels with Managing Director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ urg has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin , and wants to make it a house of three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
&quot; two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ians and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b . &quot;
&quot; Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at the entrance , and when you ride the house , it will be clear that extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; floors were torn out , ceilings to a part , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
&quot; until March , there is much to do . &quot;
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black style .
&quot; the rooms are fitted with large sha@@ dy showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , the new window will be installed . &quot;
everything should be later &quot; beautiful &quot; close &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; not to move at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already st@@ resses in a higher downtown level . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide . &quot;
&quot; both individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , he already led , so sciss@@ ors . &quot;
the performances of the city are covered with the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; almost under a million euro , it expects . &quot;
&quot; the outside facilities are also brought to front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; a large terrace , which is open to public in a courtyard , is open to public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Invest@@ ig@@ ler sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special Representative Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury in a report . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , the panel recorded work in the past few weeks , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under calling on the job . &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as signs that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigation and intensi@@ fied .
&quot; the CNN CNN reported , there is already the first pre@@ loading of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; U.S. secret services acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since long , targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 . &quot;
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were languages between tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago , that the special educ@@ ator Tr@@ ump personally got into the centre and find the accus@@ ation , whether the president may not hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
the main task of Grand Law@@ ys is to examine and decide the evidence in possible failure cases and to decide whether the prosecution is to be charged .
&quot; therefore , Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called &quot; Count &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; mostly , they are turned on if there are greater and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; moreover , the body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to the interro@@ gation of E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the station CNN , CNN were already issued in order to turn off the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting , were invited to a statement called it in the report . &quot;
they should provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultants and s@@ add@@ ings J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner , as well as his dam@@ er election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was talking with the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday night in the US television that the entry was showing that Mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary to act fast . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have to be called that the Grand Jury will be on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the objec@@ tion of the Gre@@ mi@@ um is the beginning of a new phase in investigations and a new reason to concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the president took place in West Virginia in order to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the theme of the Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about them . &quot;
&quot; his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he wi@@ se nothing of the establishment of a Grand jury . &quot;
&quot; however , this work is usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House for@@ giving any measures to accelerated the work of the special edition on &quot; f@@ aire &quot; way .
&quot; the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey said three times , that not to be determined against the President . &quot;
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something changed to it , called it in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; due to this R@@ aus@@ al &apos;s accus@@ ations , accus@@ ations made against dr@@ ump lou@@ dly , he would like to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him a setting of the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is due to investigation under large pressure .
&quot; according to representation of US media , the White House collected material against the special edition and its employees . &quot;
that dissolved spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent special edition of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later President Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller has fired a position in which he could be fired on the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the alleg@@ ations on Thursday , according to which the special edition could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ice@@ berg has been replaced by the scar@@ city of almost seven times . &quot;
the Se@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener @-@ Institute for Polar@@ - and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large colon@@ oss are now going to the north and will probably take two , three years until he melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the largest polar regions who have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
a danger for people don &apos;t go out of him .
&quot; in what extent of climate change , climate change has played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice , is un@@ clear according to research . &quot;
&quot; however , in total , there have been a series of unusual cl@@ ashes of ice sk@@ ill@@ ations in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) in a fact basis . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ oss was now a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ celebrated .
Sch@@ el@@ eb@@ s floating on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aciers .
it is growing steadily into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; north of this Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ at , the balance of wa@@ xing was distur@@ bed and break down some years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete scarf is falling there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn so far as far as at present . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ice plate can fall under tension and can be crushed if there is a piece of a piece . &quot;
&quot; melt from Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase the level , as they swim in water and ice so much water as it emerg@@ es after the melt . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of shame leads to the sea , that the gl@@ aciers can flow directly into the sea , and can flow faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level , but only in small dimensions , the British research project for the observation of the Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ n , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ celebrated is the fourth biggest ch@@ el@@ ight of Antar@@ c@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , along the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and no direct connection to climate change is conscious , the ice plate is now in a dangerous position , &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists should be controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ solem@@ s will go back again , and possibly coinci@@ dentally , his colleague Adrian Luck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this trend will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers have not run the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice@@ berg on climate change , so in recent decades a lot of ice@@ bergs are destroyed by the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula . &quot;
this long section of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the temperature increase has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have war@@ med around three degrees in the past 50 years , and t@@ ame them in the areas where the temperature is fastest sti@@ ff . &quot;
CDU wants to stay at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy freely @-@ quality jobs , the CDU , from the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the Kreis@@ administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have got their first day of work behind . &quot;
the doctr@@ ines in the circle are obviously very desired .
some 620 applications were to be recorded for this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is missing to be able to handle the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
currently there are M@@ ett@@ mann circle at the circle M@@ ett@@ mann after 50 not occupied places .
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers are searching for general administration . &quot;
the CDU wants to take place together with F@@ DP and the U@@ WG together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG .
&quot; according to the desire of the parties , &quot; a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development work . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not just short @-@ term constra@@ ints of skilled workers , but forward @-@ orient@@ ated the candidate of candidates . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should refer to inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personnel problems , they didn &apos;t recognize earlier . &quot;
other cities advert@@ ise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is entitled &quot; Contest of public employer . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ condition@@ ally comes from the service . &quot;
so the highest time to act so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ oples , Chief of the CDU , continues to deal with his party with his party . &quot;
&quot; he felt un@@ long already in the chal@@ k day for a fat surprise , when he publicly presented the personnel cost of public in question , and the other parties were blo@@ wn out . &quot;
people would like to be checked out that all possibilities will be checked to allow an exit from the municipal employer .
&quot; if we do not arrive at a satisfactory solution here , the county seat should be united with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - a pet rate . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CDU , employees and officials are trying to pay better than they actually see the public service for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money , if one changes in a higher level that is oriented to professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle are increasingly grown in the past years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms were designed to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute law law . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy har@@ dening the tone to NGO migrants rescue life
&quot; in Italy , NGOs working for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they cannot continue to continue their rules for operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have no new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
Min@@ n@@ itis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; youth R@@ ager &apos; because whose crew had worked together with human traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way they lighten@@ ed illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to express itself from the Italian government of Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in search and rescue zone , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion about social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only assess all charges , which are currently collected , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities have supervised the boat of &apos; youth R@@ ager &apos; , who supervised the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew of tu@@ g migrants will be supplied on board , which can be delivered directly by human hands , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can be used , so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meetings took place only 1,3 miles prior to Libyan coast , according to the government of State , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected to over@@ take care of the authority of the Italian coast , which over@@ sees lif@@ egu@@ ards in the zone of humanitarian reasons and not of any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of code , boats must have used boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a primarily an Italian police officers , who supervised their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs working on search and rescue par@@ agra@@ phs , have previously been prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday , that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily but acceptable , since they would not have any &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti said meanwhile , that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy , resulting in the past few weeks to strengthen the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast and the cooperation with the local farmers . &quot;
&quot; during the last days , we started to see light at the end of the tun@@ nels , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; in this month , he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizenship in this month and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
ascent and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ er@@ mer Bik@@ er , the &quot; Berliner out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North @-@ Palat@@ inate for four days , and enjoy the tourist attractions for four days . &quot;
three @-@ friendly guides were available for this .
the accommodation at Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
&quot; the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle , above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim . &quot;
&quot; it was followed points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest and the out@@ sour@@ ced planes . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were still longer inc@@ entive for the long Tri@@ als . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest . &quot;
&quot; again , look@@ out look@@ out look@@ out to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate approach . &quot;
&quot; in the last two days , many altitude meters were announced . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shops brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers re@@ located in the open @-@ air content of healing Sole . &quot;

&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had learned the Pf@@ äl@@ zer forest from his best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga lists for e @-@ sport
&quot; the Sport Stars are sitting in the future of computer consoles , rather than strug@@ gling with wind and weather over the stadium ras@@ ive ? &quot;
&quot; fact : E @-@ sport is long ago to a serious growing industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first Bundes@@ lig@@ aver@@ an , which increasingly engage in this field . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2015 , the V@@ f@@ L Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire completely new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on this train still rising some clubs .
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organis@@ es FIFA in London the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where the gam@@ ers compete in different clubs . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or PS@@ V will be qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es a agency for virtual football player .
&quot; the real football player must ins@@ man in particular with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to go into the stadium , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sport collectors under contract , you could present online much more often on these markets as only once in the year the federal government to Asia . &quot;
how is it exactly ?
&quot; during the e @-@ sport computer games like &quot; League of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or the football @-@ simulation FIFA on competitions . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sport , Li@@ es have already established , in which professionals will compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the 2022 World Cup , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it all around a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is uns@@ afe . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y has also been disp@@ at@@ ted with the question .
&quot; for the Professor at the German sports school in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because he is competent and many biological and physical reactions displaying you also in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress actions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also need cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and rapid response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only be at the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
f@@ rob@@ ous but also problems : &quot; D@@ oping will always be a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult through online games , and in the scene lacking the structures of classic sports . &quot;
the scientists emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are international on the way , that &apos;s like a great global family , there is no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
a study by corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( B@@ U ) tells the e @-@ sport a fast growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , Spon@@ sor@@ ing and large tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales of 130 million are expected . &quot;
&quot; against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already .
&quot; great markets , Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton K@@ ut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports race providers Uni@@ cr@@ n .
there is a lot in Europe too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a class@@ room , F@@ rob@@ ber@@ y says . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the soccer league clubs according to D@@ utt is now required to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany behind Germany &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B executive board of R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only in nostal@@ gia to fall , and the old times to clari@@ fy , is not enough anymore . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore going to store the tradition of the association , but the company also set up the company at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; since it cannot hold on it , that only at football , everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Carter was sentenced to his life in June for the hom@@ icide killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
Roy &apos;s father said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend .
Carter was allowed to appeal to the vocation .
&quot; she had been faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but their legal representatives argu@@ ed that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; in red tro@@ users and a creamy bl@@ use , Carter stood there with tears in the eyes , folded hands and down , when she was convicted . &quot;
&quot; their actions Conrad Roy killed , &quot; &quot; said the State of State . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ rier lawyer said , it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she regre@@ ts completely . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even their spirits have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that there is no day that I don &apos;t get the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I would like to be proud of me and how I am proud of all . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters there , is it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never be persecuted by the realization that she would never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding or a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this one person who had been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I am always kept for the rest of my life forever , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to set a true preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to commit suicide , committed suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mono@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case with@@ drew national attention , after Car@@ ry text releases that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanged yourself , spring from a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; everything you need to do is to turn off the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from any press by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was sentenced to murder in 2007 for murder , was sentenced to murder , before she was acquitted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter ear@@ ns compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
&quot; Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run as captain at the Audi Cup , no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern respon@@ ds to the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm .
&quot; anything else was in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made his bin@@ der to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not declare it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
good one could have better run than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but K@@ imm@@ ich was able to suggest the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight years older Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal was chosen out of youth toys , de@@ but@@ ants , and just out of the holiday we have chosen existing C @-@ El@@ f as a player guide . &quot;
&quot; sugar is distributed to those who want to give a lot of dar@@ nel , which you want to keep at La@@ une . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to join the Heritage of Lah@@ m , you can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ ich confirmed , &quot; This is what you want to do as a player : responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old is located as a mini @-@ lame on the field .
&quot; right behind , that &apos;s his position , the white Bin@@ d on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ ich worked in this start @-@ information such as the one who can take the rest in the hand too . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to turn the un@@ installed tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were busy with themselves . &quot;
&quot; V@@ idal thus to play his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , come out to the benefits of Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ ks only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not to fall in their first appearance in the Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ co@@ t . &quot;
this all was fol@@ dable .
&quot; beside K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y ran before the defense , both ag@@ ated sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the emin@@ ent occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ ver tried a few times a few times . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y announced that the result was &quot; not so , &quot; as we were hoping for us . &quot;
but he also showed an ordinary performance in the debut .
&quot; playing siege , speed change : &quot; for this style I was also brought forth . &quot;
&quot; as un@@ used this Bayern world still stands for new entran@@ ces , one saw the game in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Rud@@ y was not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs . &quot;
K@@ imm@@ ich passed after a few cr@@ un@@ ky testimony in the back of his new players .
&quot; and there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; what goes here , I &apos;ve already noticed . &quot;
&quot; with Bavaria , you have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he must not bring the new one more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhineland @-@ äl@@ z@@ ish ministers : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom temp@@ o
&quot; the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic Minister of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Not@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a shift in economic policy - and simultaneously the old minist@@ ries simultaneously .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has blocked all . &quot;
the biggest revers@@ er sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policies : the circuit of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the priority list of the country .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 should be the construction right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the west side of Trier , which is in the most urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ road map . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ speaking Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
Nat@@ us sees a sign to support regional but internationally competitive companies .
&quot; the Chamber of commerce and industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as of knowledge , is excited to boost sales in the Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to stop the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I have an open ear for people who want to establish their own company is the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; the crafts@@ manship of Trier looks in the new Master Bonus , an additional inc@@ entive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of € 1000 is provided for the ful@@ fill@@ ment of € 1000 for the Stand@@ ing masterpiece and 2,500 euros , when graduates within ten years after the master &apos;s education . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road construction work quickly to create facts , at the same time , in the country the necessary staff , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set knowledge during the state operation , have been occupied only 29 places so far . &quot;
the I@@ HK demands to forgive more orders to external offices .
&quot; the CDU @-@ Group vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to the calculations of the invoice , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of national roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to fix the lack of skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing may also be the old broadband construction in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the supply supply in an I@@ HK survey only with the score 3,4 . &quot;
they analyze mol@@ ding internet connections and abor@@ tions .
ex @-@ economic Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind turbine Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Party left Lem@@ ke for April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where it already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers can be faced with a counter@@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said , the company is the opinion that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich where BMW is based on diesel vehicles or to limit . &quot;
Daimler was announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the companies as a return .
European autom@@ akers have the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon emissions .
&quot; but nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ em@@ it diesel engines , are considered as a carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the costs for automotive manufacturers , installations for neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also take what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to ignore the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the use of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called way @-@ old devices to regulate the regulations if a car was tested , but with normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were indicted , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States before judgment . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations to Volkswagen after the authorities have installed the system to handle the emission regulations in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi in the test could use Volkswagen hard to load : the luxury car manufacturer contributes over proportional to profit from Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ ni@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ dil@@ lo was one of the most published carto@@ ons @-@ Dra@@ fts@@ man who are the rat@@ chet of his figures are trademarks .
&quot; with 85 , the Argentin@@ ean is still working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ dil@@ lo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he killed himself as a drawing for gambling cards by - which was fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ iest day in my professional life was the day when he lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the &apos; 60s of breakthrough : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match &quot; and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dil@@ lo found many fans .
the artists had always been inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dil@@ lo figures in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting on drawing up today at the drawing day , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endars , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ Shirts , pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks will continue to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ dil@@ lo . &quot;

&quot; this is why he rather reli@@ es on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , will be produced . &quot;
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lavender is decl@@ ining because of the conditions in drought conditions and because of the diseases transferred to insects , which are looking for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , large head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effective at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring , and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has imp@@ lications for the life of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ades , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil , not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of very long plant pipes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; solutions that are considered to be considered , include a better water distribution and slow@@ down of the ev@@ ap@@ oration of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the Weekly Ri@@ o@@ ce will usually meet Wed@@ nes@@ days to check their plans for reporting on the most recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ listening drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of her own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children with your office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; three words on a plaque at the front of the space is written : opponent , Neut@@ ral , allies . &quot;
&quot; you ask the reporter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and abdominal cav@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of crimin@@ als which make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there are no rest of violence , and throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are increasingly more journalists : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto took office in December 2012 , and now there were at least seven dead in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her in@@ spir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is received deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; T @-@ Shirts , who will show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian face . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporter discuss their shared topics that trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 , a special prosecutor &apos;s Office was built to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for Protection of journalists only led two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , who are connected every year with drug traff@@ icking and organic crimes , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are only rarely tried . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a while they are in@@ separ@@ able and although the terrain is still tra@@ itors . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know , we don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was forced out of two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; 12th river . &quot; &quot;
the cont@@ actor drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing about the topic of Val@@ dez .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrested the past year and delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since ri@@ val@@ ed fra@@ ctions fight here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot at the streets or that the cemetery is full of displaced , two @-@ story Maus@@ ol@@ een for drugs , who are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; remember a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only one Kart@@ ell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , with the blame that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understanding have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first in February , the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of a riv@@ alled cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may be off@@ ended with the sons , the gang@@ sters bought each copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to force Val@@ dez , after the capture of another newspaper , which had published the same story , left the country on its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues got that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 , he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este as he joined the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce together with five colleagues . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hes@@ itation , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper served a reputation for the cour@@ ageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took . &quot;
&quot; reporter loved it , hard to publish research without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication where they could read stories that no one can handle anything else . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Preis &quot; for its coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history , where ever she led them . &quot;
he gave voluntarily to that he had fear .
&quot; I want to continue to live , &quot; &quot; he said to the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trade in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in the past October . &quot;
you must adopt the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked , &quot; &quot; What did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce @-@ Team missed Val@@ dez , the Spa@@ ß@@ vo@@ gel , who was like a harbour worker , the friend who had gener@@ ously with hu@@ gs and counsel , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted on his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now she asks : was his love for routine to be routine ?
&quot; his death also forced her to ask her own instructions in question , how they can do their work at best and staying alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home start and landing ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ suffici@@ ency and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ in@@ ct .
&quot; if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing with Javier happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others say , in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - as not as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states , in which a toxic blend of lu@@ cr@@ ative mu@@ g@@ gel@@ rou@@ cks , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no cell phones allowed . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively on governments , used for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
two polic@@ emen sought refuge in front of the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a Vict@@ orian building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in a joke , some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who called the governor itself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug bound de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the output of this week , Ri@@ o@@ ce has put on three main layers . &quot;
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , focused on the hom@@ etown of the Governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about it , who was kidn@@ apped , or as it happened , so be careful to write , as it was time to write , what each in the town knows : that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traff@@ ick@@ ers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public recordings that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) that ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of being charged with corruption . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the reporter , about previous inci@@ dents in this local restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man was de@@ ferred to a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best inform@@ al source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its sl@@ ender body . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , who prot@@ ested against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something that they have never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
replica Mi@@ riam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor &apos;s office .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; throughout the country , journalists were stronger than they have written in organised protests &quot; SOS Press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to express journalists and let them kill them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is re@@ divided by the government , because she is concerned , her anger has injured their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico signed from organis@@ ational crimes , involved government officials and a par@@ valid society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die , because you would like to hold the mouth , &quot; &quot; R@@ ami@@ rez said . &quot;
obviously the mor@@ de have a terrible effect .
nobody passed the death of the blo@@ gger Mary Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .

&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ ud@@ ad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug events with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as it apparently revealed to the photographer Ruben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue to stay and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;

&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s . &quot;

the front page had to be changed on the next day .

&quot; how can you just think of it , &quot; &quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; if the same day , when Javier was murdered , the practition@@ er asked me about to send them on the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , even a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even realize that his fur@@ y skin of rub@@ ber@@ y was brown - and they said they would have had something from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the incub@@ ated din@@ osau@@ rs , who ever been found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs specimens in the world . &quot;
the F@@ ossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; the researchers invented it as a &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ge@@ pan@@ te plant species is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look more precisely . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ossil discovered by him , was sent into the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re only a little bit with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the principal author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
it is going to enter history as one of the most beautiful and best din@@ osau@@ rs copies - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r .
&quot; researchers found out that this plant leaves , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a convertible breast@@ plate , probably threatened by meat @-@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide themselves before pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a par@@ atro@@ ss which is used as counter@@ bur@@ ial , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies , experts , what indicates that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creation from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made headlines in May and is now on the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments over his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the const@@ ern@@ ing , a widespread defense method in the animal , meaning that the tip of the creature dar@@ ker was dark than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sha@@ dy is usual , the results are surprising as the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals alive today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by enough pressure through flesh @-@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution increased the wear of con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the cont@@ entions - think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras or Gür@@ tel@@ ev@@ eh - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than lo@@ ot , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behaviour on a massive , strong din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors have to have been to have been &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ rs w@@ rie was rot@@ ten .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life , including his controversial Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes , to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and was cast into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea floor . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta was so warm as South @-@ flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with con@@ serv@@ iced skin , but also in three dimensions remain and the original form of the Tier@@ es ret@@ ains &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the result is , that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early chal@@ k time . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t need much imagination to design it . if you only have a little bit with the eyes , you could believe that he is sleeping in sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when huge thermal periods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived million years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ge@@ aring din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his terrible ancestors . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta was sank after the death in the sea , and in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he was in the Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the preserved din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle until th@@ ig@@ h . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips made by his shoulders .
researchers believe that the ar@@ mo@@ red plant con@@ cre@@ ed through western Canada was flooded through the flooded river in the open sea until an over@@ flooded river .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ rs keep his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the dist@@ ressed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house are still hol@@ low mo@@ wing plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic is such a level of preser@@ ving so &apos; seldom like a win in l@@ otto .
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it will . &quot;
sul@@ ated remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot is on his side , his five fingers crossed up to the top . &quot;
I can count the scales on its sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday night on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous injured , kilomet@@ er@@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , on the late Thursday afternoon , there were about 20 people in the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first figures of the police were at 17.00 between the inter@@ connecting no@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm , nearly 30 vehicles , among them probably also lor@@ ries , in@@ hib@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; beyond the exact number of the injured persons , no data was introduced . &quot;
&quot; it was light to moderate to moderate injuries , a pol@@ ishing woman said . &quot;
a great charge of lif@@ es@@ aving motor vehicles was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed in Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres long back@@ rest was formed . &quot;
&quot; like a AZ reporter , it also occurred on the counter@@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade refers to the identification number of vehicle manufacturers that now have to calculate with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , then a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a coll@@ ision between a car transporter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : Group test@@ et &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ f .
the Schaff@@ ner comes up and w@@ akes up an uns@@ an@@ ft or breaks the passenger seat in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interru@@ ptions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the create ticket control .
&quot; by phone , you are simply confirmed by mobile phone that you can be taken up and evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it out . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of coming year on many more remote circuits in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in , &quot; calls the train ticket without a Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what most passengers do already have to do .
&quot; you have to have bought it over the app that bought DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works so : you asc@@ ends to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the test customers , a button on electronic de@@ valuation appears . &quot;
&quot; the train leaders get a message on their mobile devices , that Fahr@@ enheit X is located in the train and taken the booked seat . &quot;
&quot; comes the train conductor at the chassis control of Platz Y , he knows that there is a passenger seat with already ent@@ able online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the train - what again the passengers should use . &quot;
&quot; who would like to travel without ticket control by our train staff , check in DB navig@@ ator simply . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to design their travel time in the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing management of DB correspondence . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our employees have more time than today to go to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who go by train , knows that in addition to delay and pas@@ sports trains , the ticket checks are among the biggest sleeves . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers don &apos;t have all the documents you need for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or identity card or otherwise a document you need to refer .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train managers and driving , which leads to worse mood in the part or large space and del@@ ays during the control of your own tickets , and the Schaff@@ ner takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
&quot; and also , on the connection of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen . &quot;
further train numbers on the same distance are not un@@ locked .
how a activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on August 9 , 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to their core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ roll through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post of someone from the High School .
&quot; the police has just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and there is still on the road , it was there . &quot;
&quot; pu@@ zz@@ led , because no one had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was continually praying on her tim@@ eline .
&quot; the Rap@@ per from the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 year old , who was killed by a white polic@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ bl@@ os@@ em body that was stretched out on the street and there was four hours there .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was not new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone in order to return to Twe@@ ets on the Can@@ field Drive later on the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be his father &apos;s father , who brought a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebelli@@ ous dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , secured another polic@@ eman , and cried , &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is not common , &quot; Fer@@ rell remembered her statement . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder , which we have acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed to us and we can call it typically . &quot;
&quot; in that moment , I felt sho@@ ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and wept . &quot;
they booked a return trip and went home on the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 : 00 , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided to drive the two next morning to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and protest , the love and the losses , the strength and the resistance , which consists of the sight of people living in the community , and the streets filled to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell ran with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; above the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight , what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; she remembered that which she said . &quot;
&quot; we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy , and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not bring them away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
&quot; it has to know , and see it . &quot;
&quot; it must be well developed , not only acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced , it is not different than the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove you a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station which was waiting for a camp@@ ground , when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge officer of the Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business partners there , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped them on protest@@ ers .
slowly began a new type of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my acti@@ vism changed completely after the 9th of August , &quot; &quot; she said and not@@ ices that she was as a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student N@@ ur@@ ses Association , focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organizers .
it &apos;s all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met in an evening demonstration of Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar only wanted &quot; document &quot; what happened .
a question came Fer@@ rell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story which you can use ?
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism was nourished by countless cases of people , often from the White - in a community that benef@@ ited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we had heard that people who have been born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his acti@@ vism . &quot;
&quot; his commitment , Fer@@ rell brought the project closer together with six other loc@@ als , followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , as I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rel@@ ls &apos;s experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide , but for a community that come together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Fer@@ rel@@ le &apos;s life , as she loves himself and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain things in this work , and with the human protection of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rel@@ ls history is repe@@ ating the role of black tails women in the bro@@ ader Black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teenage camp Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify itself as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we fight at different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; the movement really is kept standing by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; by the Fer@@ rell chosen as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , even though it was at the front front , because with a life on these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can sense your energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; she describes the social atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she kl@@ ets herself on a song , and she feels committed to this memory , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on for three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; magn@@ itude &quot; : TV @-@ reader discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , even though it was not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone split up the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold leaves the subject hardly any .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; is discussed the subject .
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say : &quot; it would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; it would be really great &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , coming from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ aking ) or simply : &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates building on that a gallery will take more customers into the city , of which other businesses are benef@@ ited , the enemy fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition : the gallery is planned precisely on the property , where the farm market stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the start of the construction work , it will be conclusion . &quot;
the gallery @-@ M@@ acher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Bed@@ a square with a possibility to sitting outside .
&quot; Simone rooms : &quot; we &apos;ve been selling almost weekly in the peas@@ ant market for many years . &quot;
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of land women are very happy again . &quot;
we also have discovered the but@@ cher for us .
&quot; we would like to wish that , while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
&quot; above all , the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; the direct mark@@ er in a market hall in the gallery will come on the amount of rent .
but that should not be low in the new project .
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping spre@@ ader in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dro@@ pping - or supermarkets : I think it &apos;s superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you see how many shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but there is not even a regular weekly market here , it is the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains at least . &quot;
&quot; because after all , the product offered is fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer , and is purely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping center is rented only by larger companies , because the local r@@ ents are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; shame , special stores , is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably disappear again . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a Mark@@ thalle fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the peas@@ ant market during the construction time ?
the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even if the bit @-@ gallery is actually actually coming .
or does it already make the g@@ hosts bit Gallery before to drive all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not work .
&quot; and a shopping center that is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there is no place for a peas@@ ant rock music - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg has no place anymore .
&quot; when the farmers market is made , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a perfect simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown that hang almost infinite - which hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ es@@ ern and Haar@@ c@@ utt@@ ons made by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analysts had served a 35 @-@ year sentence , after she publicly made diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted to its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a Trans@@ ition and pioneering discretion , whose sentence was converted by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA produced by Mann@@ ing , and out of the 30 portraits , such as someone could not only look at the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ firm@@ ities Det@@ er@@ min@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , has already been convicted of the identification as a woman , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the sp@@ ying law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the prison , her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only a single photo - a grain , black @-@ white Sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is deliberately sitting on a driver seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde bar@@ gain - which was associated with them . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portraits of foreigners produced from for@@ en@@ ian arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ar @-@ um@@ mel and che@@ wing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people might look like . &quot;
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg stated at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were disp@@ leased several letters in the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o Illu@@ stri@@ ced Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ lied Images , &quot; which would fore@@ see a future in which the President Chel@@ i@@ od@@ our would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ers release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happ@@ ier meetings . &quot;
&quot; it is also available at the opening of the exhibition , some deep and star@@ kes , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camps and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid column which he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with their superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , which are based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , its mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hop@@ ed , showing the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific Lex@@ icon of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hope to take away is that our gen@@ ome don &apos;t care about , who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories also said . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in an own room , is one side from the above mentioned comic Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as they appears with a Freis@@ pre@@ cht@@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hand of the discipl@@ ines of the United States , such as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; if they ch@@ ill your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never do the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m still looking at all , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally , as it was supposed to be taken in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed into the center of space by their own gen@@ om@@ ic Sim@@ ul@@ ak@@ ras , who like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted as all in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , with which their genetic ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd &apos;s crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said by the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , as the movement , which was behind the liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is in progress for a professor at the North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which had been susp@@ ects as susp@@ ects , after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been caught with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , like the Ak@@ ten of the National Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bul@@ ls . &quot;
a general warning system stated by the Chicago Police Authority that the LEICA was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries in his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still explained on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ates the Sti@@ che as a murder , while the police is actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ es , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been excluded in ass@@ aul@@ ts and was excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operated on this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
a spokes@@ man of the University and the t@@ ville College was said in an e @-@ mail Declaration that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Great Britain and ready to help us to help US investig@@ ational authorities .
&quot; the statement added that War@@ riors colleagues are sho@@ cked , and want to be sho@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; chief Communications Officer of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ect to ask the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to locate them . &quot; &quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just got a mysterious tip that had just happened in the apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el@@ ly .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it was un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victims had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim , and resear@@ ches a variety of moti@@ ves , including a possible domestic stock . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA tim@@ etable in the near future &quot; - Russian Viz@@ ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a specific stage of fulfilling the criteria of the schedule , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA tim@@ etable was updated in this regard , &quot; Mut@@ ko explained on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re@@ generating R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything for the reason for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list criteria states that the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping authorities approved the reported results of the WA@@ DA permit by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to the alleged state @-@ sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has changed a bug . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit something that exists . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v issued problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report will be controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has added to accept this report , &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled in November 2015 as part of the D@@ oping Sk@@ and@@ als from WA@@ DA from performing D@@ oping control in Russia .
&quot; however , you have been permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved to the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your company , do not become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy is trying to measure your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful , or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised An@@ ony@@ m@@ ity , some workers do not mourn before the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was just never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said that the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed runs . &quot;
she has called people from the outside .
a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at the wa@@ xing to help businesses to find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licens@@ ing software that provide the specific purpose of the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to handle individuals and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ n allow to handle the C @-@ suite managers and turn right to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; to salvation , she said that they think a better insight into what your staff think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and p@@ olls of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that displays most complaints and which managers have low access results - so that you can drill bit , why . &quot;
&quot; in order to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to have been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which describes a former employee in Sk@@ and@@ ale since then a former employee has been published in sc@@ and@@ als , which in which those who have spoken is punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion worth , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and see , saw an increase in interest and activity at the beginning of this year , in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ mi@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ t Company can send a customized &quot; pulse &quot; p@@ olls , confi@@ dential answers in real time and watch the heat @-@ cards of your problem . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the chief executive guide is involved , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has recorded the shelves , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it may experience precious consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers of workers and complaints , &quot; said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations in order to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find an telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , a formal complaint and hope that he was seriously taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ convenience and un@@ comfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good possibility to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company Conver@@ cent insert , problems that were in offices in offices in cities or states that were hidden in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practition@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; I can be closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment dispute . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen broke out because of the Enron sc@@ ams , the Quin@@ lan said . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; prior to the use of technology for monitoring the ethics , people used hope than a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and the company loaded with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of venture capital investors who support both start @-@ ups .
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
Gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November from Bess@@ emer venture Partners and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment will hardly be surprising , given the net@@ worked nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex on research , showing that today &apos;s staff expect more than so far . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inser@@ ts . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be able to feel their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience near Link@@ ed@@ In which both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach R@@ end@@ ums when their portfolio companies are running well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; when the Analytics tools promise third parties , commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find assistance . &quot;
the data on employee &apos;s commitment according to experts from the workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are us@@ eless when the administrator of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees according to your feedback , it may have a anticip@@ ation that the change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments can motiv@@ ate and motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you &apos;ll have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen themselves on the collecting of data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the employees to follow , &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who is now through monthly employees in monthly , was able to introduce measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , to be saved . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to add several teams within the company &apos;s decision @-@ making and to add several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company receives new insights about the staff , and it hopes for a long run of view , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; Vit@@ rano said . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you will lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
&quot; it starts at 23 o &apos;clock , as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp .
a lunch break for a good part of the team .
players who are inscri@@ bed to the summer courses are returning after the three hour exercise before they return at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ arius Football Center in the next morning .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real T@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ CL@@ A should begin at 19 : 15 , in order to meet the full @-@ packed sched@@ ules of the player . &quot;
&quot; the compromise from the two days is more than one day , at which Bru@@ ins started the start of the camps almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as , during the first time during Mor@@ as , during the summer school during the summer school . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start with Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; MOR@@ A said that he supports the change of N@@ CAA support , even if they add a further point routes to the player . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous burden three or four days on them , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just p@@ onder@@ ed it , they plac@@ ements themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will finish their practices , as soon as the camp has ended , which has been terminated in view of clear Si@@ des of its fields from a adjacent park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of elevated class that has already been drawn up with foot@@ balls , which will be no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ in players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a has a problem that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far brought to think that people rent a room there and then adjust the exercise there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video of a practice , it is a rather good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry about this too big .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in the fight against fake messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterfeit detection of third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible counterfeit messages , and show them to the fac@@ simile test of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News , many believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; the problem also has become a major political theme in Europe , where the French elec@@ tors were flooded with false stories in May with false stories , and Germany will support a plan according to the social media networks , and Germany will not succeed , h@@ ass@@ filled posters such as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement on German , that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories of fac@@ simile checked third parties will want to meet more context in order to meet and share what they read and share , &quot; &quot; said Sara Su , Product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature &quot; &quot; in relation to the article &quot; &quot; and to other changes to his news feed to decrease false messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a Castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a sque@@ eze music video and was a si@@ di@@ hole for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history of its cozy seat in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent , and now is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so beautiful to look on the hand@@ writing of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ h@@ one . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; en@@ cir@@ cled the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac hand@@ ie@@ wicz , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on one archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that was un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I only re@@ acted on the side of a letter to the page of a letter that was written by a double room in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is its own print !
&quot; and letters always smell as smoke , because it was kind@@ led a fire because of light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would be even there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who struck so with old Pap@@ ers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; I have to be a little over@@ rated &quot; ) that everything seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and the many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ished hy@@ per heads on the walls and the bottles of the centuries . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with coun@@ ties , gar@@ dener , and sometimes with the artists that worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
then he drank &quot; Whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust was only awarded the full access in 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rates said , &quot; &quot; Oh , it described it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps that represent what had possessed : &quot; you could mean that land tiles would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des ,
&quot; guys , let all the aisle go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter a wider base in the English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which leaves the newly built castle to join the farmer &apos;s farmer from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an u@@ pro@@ ar which occurred 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant arose in this field and I thought , a revol@@ t is a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly ro@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who tells the story of the Jesu@@ it music for seven years during the English re@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers of Arthur Dar@@ rell presented his own funeral , filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his Sar@@ g was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rel@@ ls are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen seemed to be quite a good mood , getting more debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell @-@ men extingu@@ ishes their school thinking , helping them married old women - I imagine a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advert@@ ise hei@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his revenue in the castle , Rho@@ des in search of other unique scre@@ am experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ äm@@ än@@ mä@@ ki behind him , the terrain of a san@@ atorium in the early 20th century , which has since been required by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Ah , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign to launch a new roof brand in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf on Friday of the 301 years old Mary Hon@@ ne@@ f at the launch of a new roof brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) .
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team around Nelson Art@@ z will hold the logo and the slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , a celebration of the campaign will give a celebration on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; the makers ask the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on her yesterday un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to win your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as a private honey@@ comb citizen around the beauty and attra@@ cti@@ veness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in the action , it is going to go more than &quot; only &quot; a logo and a slogan , it &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise to form@@ ulate , one that gives the city a distinctive distinctive feature . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; in the middle five @-@ digit amount , the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f can cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign . &quot;
military forms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year in the beginning of August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es on retirement and impair@@ ments in the op@@ iz@@ ier@@ sk@@ or@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
&quot; but nothing is routine in the Turkish forces , one year after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was not held in the building of General Staff , as previously , but in the minister of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Vice @-@ President and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
so they were civilians in the Y@@ as in the transition .
the government pul@@ ls the bre@@ eder in the military .
&quot; Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar stays in office , but the commander of the army and the Navy have been removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of 326 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the Erdo@@ gan is a wire @-@ pin of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , which have been directly involved in the coup attempt , has been involved in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; since he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan is really in handle ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ cover in the Military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general Staff there , Bes@@ org@@ he wrote because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , among others , in the lifting of the head@@ board for solo@@ ists , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the Grand cle@@ aring at the army and the security forces still continues .
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was fired by decree further 73@@ 95 state operators , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it seemed , when Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military . &quot;
the gener@@ als are formerly known as the real masters of the country .
three times p@@ utsch@@ ed them under calling on their role as watch@@ men of the world leaders .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least under calling on the reform of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erdo@@ gan is managing targeted one Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a well @-@ called officer who searched for the coup attempt from fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ o@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this could not be cold in Nato , so that NATO could not let it cold . &quot;
&quot; in the alliance , there is doubt in the alliance to the pf@@ ul@@ ness of the Turkish army . &quot;
the leadership structures and operational skills are &quot; weak@@ ened &quot; to say Nato diplom@@ ats .
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted from the media . &quot;
&quot; he looks forward to lower the legal immigrants to lower 50,000 per year , stri@@ cter rules for the planning of visa for a temporary working permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and billion dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way by the United States , such as citizens from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to help themselves and knowledge that our economy are good , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ itation for race @-@ cycle shuttle
&quot; again in the past few months , over the future of the racing transportation lines have been fought - now it &apos;s going to go fast . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , at the end of the year , the tourist area is to be built . &quot;
&quot; to secure the future of the racing transportation in the long @-@ term , according to data from the Ministry of Defense , this year is to start working on the route . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ race platform , the country knows especially for the tourism important link , &quot; &quot; declared Transport Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the cost of the distance of the distance he raised to about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future of the country , will be defin@@ iti@@ vely matched , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry and the South Sudan , as a operator , are already covered by the technical details . &quot;
&quot; this is the tim@@ etable that negotiated the vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race track should be ordered regular at the end of December 2017 .
the Race Shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and racing platform .
&quot; in the past few months , it was tested as part of a pilot operation whether the distance of sufficient many people will be used to order them again in the future . &quot;
the route is also strong in parts .
the Rise of Sex @-@ Robot is real and we should worry about
&quot; just as you thought that there can &apos;t be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about the technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robot are currently a great thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , emer@@ itus professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take their rise seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; people make it funny , but the company deliver every quantity of it , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the publication of his new report . &quot;
&quot; modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed themselves from their infl@@ atable partners to robots using a silicone skin , which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that will be achieved by artificial intelligence . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust his robot accordingly to its belie@@ fs &quot; &quot; and to all choose from the eye @-@ color of the robot over the form of breast war@@ ts up to type or colour of its finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there will still be dis@@ rup@@ tive , because many robots would have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would look progressive to the step@@ ford @-@ woman . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appe@@ aling , such as in@@ tox@@ icity . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s still those of True Compan@@ ion developed Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed figures such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which convey@@ s the impression of rel@@ ent@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; during the day , she also has its m@@ oods - quite like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many be@@ ating aspects of this rise of sex robot - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ju@@ ly female features , the announ@@ cements on rape , if you go on a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah , in@@ tran@@ qui@@ l one most . &quot;
&quot; on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men do not have Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; its emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement point to something dark and deep in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal basis of gender equality to a wish for sex with lower than optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men are of course no sex robot , and while the FR@@ R notice their rising popularity , they still remain in the edge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what was le@@ ak@@ age out of the Rand@@ om zones , in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very educational . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until they are the free market for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ cutting that these highly developed sex robots are immer@@ sed in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in which the White House has a president to have attacked women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the terrible aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic pictures , the swallowed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision seems . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it doesn &apos;t feel like a big jump . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots exists , there is a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star proportions ) . &quot;
&quot; their inheritance would like to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but when it comes to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
you cannot separate from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they do not have a placement or background history , nothing that could inter@@ fere with independence or anything , which could inter@@ fere with the imagination . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney for the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human beings
&quot; it is become a Bin@@ sen@@ w@@ ish@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political column , which have split the U.S. voters , have also divided families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ est ank@@ fest there was in the US newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ taking relatives .
we are all supposed to take care of our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cousin , a left @-@ left poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she remin@@ ded me that the unit can have a mighty action against a common enemy .
&quot; with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows whom it knows , including the Republi@@ can relationship , with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and very strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; for the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in another context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by tr@@ ump , but the ent@@ our@@ ing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; if we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ um@@ ing possibility that we will not depart from one day a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a fri@@ ght@@ ful long time scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as the ep@@ it@@ ome of failure . &quot;
&quot; I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s funny version of the tra@@ ce@@ de - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax expl@@ aining ) - both occur in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crimes . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be spiritu@@ ally healthy , to qualify as an im@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin in the city was , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sel in Central Park , the biggest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of the New York Park@@ section , and the best three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ ur@@ ry and the animals rotate to watch full of fear of their own shoulders , extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music medi@@ ates this on strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not righteous . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not over the day , when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the themes @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old and all have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I had to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but luck@@ ily no one has asked afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; at coffee from the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to cut off with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also practic@@ ed pressure on the server to bring personality in a situation in which no required is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store stood exc@@ ru@@ ined , while I made tired of the experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved with chest pain from prison in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital for the second time .
&quot; last year , he was brought to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to the hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to murder after an appeal against the first death of murder .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s early morning , by taking them several times by a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claims that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ ally int@@ ru@@ der who was hidden in the cabin .
&quot; the state attor@@ neys announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they may be too bad . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Tribunal said that they will rise in the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the verdict could be heard in this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us is running danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years , when the state attor@@ neys are successful . &quot;
there are no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four quad@@ ru@@ pe@@ ers from feeding and ho@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dismissed in the holiday and the leading schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to Gymnasium , four at the school . &quot;
President Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Mayor of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
&quot; as a symbol for school students , the 29 pupils from Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des chose a young eag@@ les that grows in the chicken court , but then released in freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and made it brü@@ ten out of his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken came out a small eagle .
&quot; but the hope to make him a chicken , spread out the eag@@ les spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ vonne Frank . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinder wore , around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for integration , said school teacher Angel@@ ika S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different to the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belong to this . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its determination is to be free .
&quot; they wish everyone four , that he feels already accepted in his new school . &quot;
&quot; it followed Dan@@ kes@@ word to the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Mu@@ eller , who always jumps on Ped@@ agog@@ ue , and the parent &apos;s parents . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen is now past , the class@@ room Sophia Schumacher stated . &quot;
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of lessons , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the vier@@ lander . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday periods . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
the new school year already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested by illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians detained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , in Si@@ th@@ onia , the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while at present an investigation is running . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were released later .
&quot; the Greek authorities have lost control over the free camp@@ es and place each one who is found to remain in a place , which is not intended for this purpose , not for this purpose . &quot;
controls are continued during the entire season .
&quot; the Ministry said , that the court may be hanging out a fine . &quot;
software update for diesel vehicles : what you need to know ?
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in action ?
the most important questions and answers in a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group software updates offered for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission standards of emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 dies@@ els or worse are excluded .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE car Club Europe gives ass@@ ess@@ ments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the recorded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates will only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann &apos;s software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the upgrade of the Federal Office ( KBA ) has ordered their re@@ armament .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a new implementation in the next months , but not called any exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communic@@ ated to write any of those affected .
&quot; if we are due to a inspection , it will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long will the revers@@ ing move up in total ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the hang@@ ings of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , volunte@@ ered to act the deal@@ er@@ ers on the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the conversion itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group ? &quot;
the ACE should wait for .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is now a massive price case of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears that .
&quot; however , in the regions where driving forces are dro@@ pping . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there has no impair@@ ments for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE goes to wait with a sale yet .

the Le@@ ar progressive TV series announced with progressive TV series . this is why you already announced to do the participation in the Gala .
&quot; the New York Times , &quot; he said : &quot; this presidency has decided to negle@@ ct the arts and human rights - even the means to draw - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphas@@ ized she will use the conversation with tr@@ ump , to make their view clear@@ er . &quot;

we do the city leb@@ ars
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes to R@@ ente in the next year . &quot;
the job is already written - suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ meister for 31 years .
and the work still makes great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it ad@@ mi@@ red him that so far , no application has to fulfil the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is searching for a architects or building engineer .
so - under cont@@ emp@@ t the regular termination date - even enough time for a revision .
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance authority , the applicants must as@@ sign appropriate shut@@ ters . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city definitely .
&quot; would it not be able to fill this anymore , the citizens would have to take the advice until Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but civil war is the city and it is important to him , says W@@ acker who reported from a good operating climate , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the wreck of pride . &quot;
&quot; we are making the city to be experienced , &quot; he is safe about the building and its staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Lower park area .
&quot; the cinema bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stage production is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone is going to get around 1.5 million euros alone , &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker also estimates . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my followers . &quot;
work here is fun . &quot;
an age @-@ age was present for a city car@@ et@@ aker .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own building yard and gar@@ t@@ ner@@ ei can be strongly re@@ acted to multiple .
&quot; you can move a lot , so W@@ acker , and the design of the green belt become often comm@@ end by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to have an eye to have what it fits , &quot; if new@@ buildings are appro@@ ves , the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ at@@ meister . &quot;
the Stadt@@ bau@@ d carries high responsibility .
&quot; he is builder , &quot; at the end everything runs on my table . &quot;
&quot; for years of care and coordination , he can count on long@@ standing employees : Markus Neum@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) has been for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor stays long , W@@ acker is looking for : &quot; we are looking for someone who really has been identified with the place and want to stay . &quot;
&quot; because continu@@ ity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the other design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you like Roland W@@ acker who want to be buried , according to the town of Has@@ lach , it should have studies as a di@@ pl@@ under@@ graduate engineer or bach@@ elor with professional knowledge of architecture and building planning law . &quot;
&quot; construction and civil engineering , construction planning , Gr@@ under@@ wer@@ b@@ san@@ itation , administration of urban properties , municipal farm with building yard and city hus@@ band@@ men as well as sub@@ ordin@@ ance administration , including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle on lines thrown : closed in the south route
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpet@@ rators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway line in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ent freight train had to be stopped .
investig@@ ators go out of two male parts and search for the night hours after them .
&quot; close to the crime scene , a ro@@ sar@@ oter roller and a bike driver has been observed . &quot;
&quot; that goes far beyond a website of Laus@@ anno@@ y , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators , or the perpet@@ rators had brought itself in great risk , and also risk @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok , the plant and the late @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail traffic could also come to the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; overall , of a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed again on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south route could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just ten persons were fallen from Friday morning , two of which looked at the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; freight trains fell not from , however , they had delay . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged for about 200 meters . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to relie@@ ve IB@@ D ( inflammation ) &quot;
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet which is rich in flesh @-@ based proteins and dairy products , the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases could lin@@ eup . &quot;
&quot; the inev@@ itable condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000 , causes stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody accidents , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; during those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers found that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han found out that the essential amino acid Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were able to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol stated that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide themselves in the food , do not enter into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells , who are able to destroy inflammation , are balanced out of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body , without sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when equi@@ li@@ bri@@ um is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , a kind of tolerance enh@@ ancing immun@@ o@@ deficiency occurs in mice that carry out a particular bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ate . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had their immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet toler@@ ate , less infl@@ amed intestinal mi@@ lie@@ us , when the same system also work with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral prizes in Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan controlled a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study powers had such cells , but another group of the same stem but had not been accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; you suspected that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ oms of mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ us , who normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice were created DNA sequ@@ ential and there were six bacter@@ ium species found in mice with the immune cells , but without they were missing in mice . &quot;
mice were tu@@ cked up in a ster@@ il@@ en environment so that they were missing an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
&quot; to understand how the bacteria improved to the immune system , the researchers added L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then brought small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on an un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells were developed to toler@@ ate cells .
&quot; when the active component of the liquid was cleansed , it proved to be known as an anne@@ x product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han Met@@ abol@@ ism , which is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ dicapped were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same toler@@ ating cells like mice , and that most of us have L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ side products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found cells in people such as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the Dar@@ ms . &quot;
potential can lead high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ us in presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to an extension of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed &quot; gen@@ ius &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United had signed a &quot; gen@@ ius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea &apos;s 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEFA Cup against Real Madrid in the H@@ age role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was exp@@ elled from the Prepar@@ ation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and had only 45 minutes to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho only 45 minutes before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u also started its start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho could still wish three further improvements , but he insi@@ sted that the club already had a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to fulfil three of his four pre@@ paid re@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; three of four , thank you for the club , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in the US state of Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the United States , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
&quot; on the radar shiel@@ ds , the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be . &quot;
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind revol@@ ves around : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still in the SPD chief , S &amp; D Prime Minister must always be held with a certain concern for Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ ks from the party headquarters , merely no counter@@ wind from the covenant - thus the most important desire of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
Martin Schulz has changed the party since Martin Schulz .
&quot; since then , employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus observe the events in the SPD @-@ reg@@ ated state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , it would not be described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were deep views .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a generic signal against Ko@@ al@@ itions of SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CDU Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ eli@@ mit of a Gre@@ ens @-@ M@@ EPs took the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the country &apos;s election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CDU and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; Michael wa@@ iter , the Green Party leader Michael wa@@ iter , asked the left @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party MP El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate . &quot;
the transition to CDU means a clear dis@@ appointment of voters will will@@ ingly .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return their mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal President and election campaign of the Green Party Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , however , the SPD election fighters , as the Friday morning , the new Hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bidden City reached the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green M@@ ouse El@@ ke &apos;s green M@@ ets to CDU without their own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations .
and nobody knows what next comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , calm the comra@@ des of stone . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was then , too - and it was clearly worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the dive , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite shut down the party again . &quot;
&quot; so , comra@@ de came back then again in the weeks later . &quot;
&quot; then , when she had trained new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him the next deep falls .
&quot; Mayor O@@ laf Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD landing , lost his Nim@@ bus because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
and because he then did something wrong in crisis communication so pretty everything you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Weil .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ gas emissions and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister had already been in criticism for the country &apos;s criticism . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ els were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe that , because in the past few weeks , Weil tried to put them stronger in the Federation . &quot;
&quot; the purch@@ aser of the former Citi@@ zen of Hanover , who will build his power in Berlin , was not hidden in the context of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
&quot; they left him , because they spoke because of a stabil@@ isation of the party . &quot;
the exact opposite could enter .
&quot; because there is no guilt in the party , because there is no guilt in the party . &quot;
and Schulz certainly not .
&quot; at times , comra@@ des therefore stri@@ ve to keep his own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is up to the green , and especially on the sliding par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ine par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and more rati@@ vely , such as Ms. T@@ life@@ jack@@ ets the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , chief of the part@@ ing in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets has not been chosen because of its person as a direct can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , but on the national list of the Dutch Green Party , the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on member states . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns to their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters out of four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the regional SPD as the leader in the federal election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career thinking of a future CDU MPs think the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said . &quot;
he called to clari@@ fy the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there has been more or continued on the CDU Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ sk@@ iers III
&quot; who would like to be renovated in the years , can receive assistance from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative ste@@ g city development on Wednesday in Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler got a look at the past .
&quot; since 1991 , it has been present in Emp@@ fingen San@@ itary areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the San@@ itary region I from 1991 to 2004 , the land Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016 , the supplement was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to promote the internal development , and not just build new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , we received the Information received by the Federal Government of Karlsruhe , that there will be a san@@ itation zone III . &quot;
&quot; the amount paid 8@@ 33 333 Euro , of which are 500 000 euros from the land , the rest of the church of Emp@@ fingen . &quot;
how do you create a san@@ itation area ?
&quot; you will continue to investigate so sh@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it plays a role , whether in the planned field at all interest , to san@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the territory may also change again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ am occurred on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal states &quot; Social City , &quot; which would then be carried out in the framework of the sanctions . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the Rev@@ it@@ alization of Inn@@ u@@ ities , improving the residential and working conditions and preser@@ vation of the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; measures would be objects , which means per property . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would eventually be established as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the approval period for the funding is running since January 1 , 2017 , until 30 April 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; even until September this year , however , the inventory intake would only be carried out once again , within the scope of those involved in the San@@ itary region involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as possible , the pro@@ positi@@ onal sign will be made , that the next year with the San@@ ations can be started . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that every Commun@@ e had to perform their own pre @-@ investigations .
&quot; it is the reason to evaluate the urban@@ istic mis@@ eries , and to decide when gentle , and in which extent . &quot;
&quot; it will then be registered for the respective property , then a san@@ itation was entered in the basic book . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after Emp@@ fingen and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel emphas@@ ized , an essential success factor for the project is the participation of those involved . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires which may be sent to citizens over the coming weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and base ar@@ c &quot; , &quot; which is among other things to build the construction condition and the restoration of restoration . &quot;
&quot; in grey questionnaire , the &quot; House@@ hold and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made up to size , distribution and residents of a housing . &quot;
the blue &quot; business arch &quot; is only to fill if in the building business premises are operated .
&quot; however , I notice that Got@@ zel pointed out that a filling questionnaire not at the same time is an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are non @-@ capable . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ized that the distribution of funding after the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; functional - who comes first comes ma@@ xing first .
no funding could reserve for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make a refurb@@ ishment &quot; pal@@ atable . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his office and can even start with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and poin@@ ter and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the im@@ plant procedure is performed according to medical standard . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pay@@ ers .
&quot; the decision of the White House , an Marine helicopter to fly to the South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production in the last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers to the United States , which had left the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour through products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was issued in Connecticut , beside a yacht out of Maine , a fire@@ fighter from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware , because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of the H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to its superior , the Deputy Commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17th at 7 : 00 in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 , and so long remained until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would need for the return flight . &quot;
&quot; during the event at the helicopter , the original plane was at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained during the plane during the time . &quot;
&quot; out of the TIM@@ E , recordings were not clear whether the second flight account was necessary . &quot;
&quot; at the Hatch Act , Federal Government provides state ownership of political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; one question that we presented was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are shut up , &quot; said the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; on the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of health reform , which was in the Senate , and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to restri@@ ct government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the trip .
but their use only demand for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation into an investigation as the presidential aircraft from the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , Ta@@ xi@@ services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced by American workers , &quot; said the deputy head of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 @-@ Occup@@ ations often lead training flights in the area around Washington and the South La@@ wn to continue the U.S. President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters .
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 led 58 exercise courses in the White House 58 . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; Made in America &quot; event counted at the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the load for any of the other pro@@ ps , presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said that the company had not been involved , to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
H@@ M@@ x @-@ 1 does not have bud@@ get@@ ed drawings for presidential flights and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
&quot; according to the US Defence Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the Do@@ D replacement for the V@@ H @-@ 3D , however , is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
records of the unit list the flight time of the plane than 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter type is far below that rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers is based on the basis of valu@@ ations , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the maintenance costs for Do@@ D do not cost the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time he defended the former press pre@@ cher of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have rel@@ ent@@ less .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to raise . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and inspired media about its own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tri@@ cky task

the TC @-@ White Ne@@ uss starts tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel in the table third Su@@ ff@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games , mak@@ eup balance sheet has become the top re@@ iter of the Second Tennis Bundesliga for reality . &quot;
team leader Mari@@ us Z@@ ay certainly has respect for opponents in any case .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
just at the rear positions I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the S@@ V S@@ V , mainly imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can also refer to the Davis Cup in the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strong in double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view of Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andre G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ reading , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ ar@@ h@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; this will always be difficult for us .
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ uss@@ er team for the trip to the high north is practically .
his debut for Blue @-@ White could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; it currently manages the Ch@@ allen@@ ger tournament in the Italian bi@@ ella active French@@ man in the Italian bi@@ ella active French@@ man , coming to the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec Col@@ our@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) for its first use in this season . &quot;

&quot; he was in Kiel , but also his like Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ school , Niel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories last Sunday against the club on the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could back again into the team . &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel his signature on Wednesday evening under the Act of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his case , the Congress en@@ acted a few &quot; constitutional instructions &quot; in his case , the Congress was packed into a few &quot; constitutional regulations . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels am ashamed of the U.S. pre @-@ war . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design sees to pun@@ ish European companies that help Russians , gas pi@@ pel@@ ines to build in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the native O@@ MV , which co @-@ financed jointly with other European companies , co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 . &quot;
the dr@@ one is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press , &quot; &quot; has been viewed , who could defend the group and could really hurt him . &quot;

roll down : the city presents 46 kitchen hel@@ pers .
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch again .
with fixed response partners for children and a assignment to the team .
the clock will be turned back in the urban children &apos;s day@@ care venues .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the urban care facilities in urban nursery facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is a good news : &quot; we all have very pleased . &quot;
cooked continues except house : a Cater@@ pillar takes over this task and provides fresh cooked cooled .
&quot; the city runs in the area of 46 children &apos;s day trips , in 44 the children are receiving a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; last Kit@@ a@@ year , 2,@@ 800 children were sitting at the tables , and the need grows steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are cared for 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita to noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also available in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children remain until 14 : 00 . &quot;
&quot; 46 students from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the fishing food , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two @-@ group @-@ groups as well as seventh tro@@ op facilities - decides about the hour@@ ly rate .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firm to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement the Kit@@ al@@ eit@@ is easier , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy food and cooking classes .
children should help to prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a familiar force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar with them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
these continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen tra@@ itors - so far is done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm , which they have exhibited in the cost between the property of property and foreign exchange , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ group@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the gu@@ ardian area not so strongly in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;

&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be a representative and cre@@ dible if women are unable to participate in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on April 5th .
&quot; the Taliban issued threats against a election process , which coinci@@ des with the transition from international host@@ ilities to an advisory role . &quot;

G@@ MB concerns about investments in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union with managers from the Bis@@ ku@@ it manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ie wants to facilitate long @-@ term commitment to the Glasgow plant in Glasgow .
&quot; G@@ MB Scotland said , the company continued over the future of investment at the Toll@@ cross location . &quot;
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , next to other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits . &quot;
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced , &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the organisation of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ie &apos;s on , &quot; concerns to express , the financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be driven . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior Organ@@ ator Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can no clarity over the business needs and investment plans for the future of Toll@@ cross , affects our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have been working here and the workers are focused heavily on the local community and the large Glasgow , an important pillar for decent jobs in an area with high unemployment and social powers . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of employment , wage and prosperity , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the rising life costs and the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow was urg@@ ently needed a floral production site at Mc@@ Vit@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al Leader at Toll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to the company &apos;s ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at Toll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate like all the companies that are working in an extremely competitive and un@@ safe economic climate , to check out our business , and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our Toll@@ cross location , in particular in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the legacy of Toll@@ cross as a manufacturing facility , and all of them should change our operations at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona been warned three years ago in front of Ne@@ y@@ mar ?
the site of La League will be interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain didn &apos;t leave Paris in her persecution by Ne@@ y@@ mar after spending an offer of £ 189 million , but have warned about three years ago in front of the world record release ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United last season . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ y@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional athletes of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious over the way , as Ne@@ y@@ mar has forced his way to outside , although a source in the vicinity of Catal@@ ans @-@ Board insi@@ sted that the club always has given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G pre@@ sidents before this view ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club to sign one of the best player from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they don &apos;t touch one of our players , then we will contact opposition to them , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , then this consequences will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G did not make sure that they would not allow it to go to the International from Italy , in any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by having lost their price for Ne@@ y@@ mar . &quot;

&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 year old was coming from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ en@@ atzen report cont@@ ex@@ ed Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen report on the abuse of abuse is Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report to the Miss@@ ing scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows continues to be held for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ators , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German Press Agency , he predicted by the former director Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the emer@@ ald Benedi@@ ct XVI , an exc@@ use . &quot;
&quot; it would be very close to the Catholic Church &apos;s reputation , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their profound printing on their own under@@ age or their wrong assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand crit@@ ici@@ zed that the reporting on violence at the Dom@@ spar@@ rows will be measured with &quot; two different measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in regard to the gri@@ ps in Regensburg , no one knows that it would be punished , but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al mani@@ pulation , &quot; as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es the public opinion to keep it normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk , &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church , and this is a few fres@@ co@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in their youth &quot; sl@@ ings have been a normal educational means &quot; to be with free children , as I was one to get ready to get ready . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ fair to turn today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; totally in@@ justice , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who translated with R@@ atz@@ inger the memory band &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to accept Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment attorney Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ vity &quot; victims of over@@ print , 67 Dom@@ en@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg , Germany : &quot; summar@@ ize can therefore hold that by Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence . &quot;
&quot; at high E@@ mot@@ ion@@ ality , the punishment for the pupils could also fall off . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many others , in contrast to many others , many victims inv@@ oked the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann declared why the final report to the mis@@ bre@@ eder scandal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was dischar@@ ged in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ in Exerc@@ ise at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen &quot; &quot; there is a contra@@ dict@@ ory image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for a lift , many students lift up his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ect@@ ist who became the ö@@ f@@ teren , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has no top performance . &quot;
how do you analyze this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask themselves , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
&quot; to him , eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of Mitt@@ al or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the non@@ violence at the school event occurred outside of its effectiveness .
&quot; it is possible to dis@@ card it , too late , or did not take advantage of it seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , which he worked , was experienced by practically all respondents than - literally - &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his student Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also describes a very excellent witness , &quot; &quot; popular &quot; , &quot; excellent , &quot; &quot; competent , and &quot; understand@@ able teacher , who served the guys regularly with cakes , cookies and bon@@ b@@ ons and were always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority is worth its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high E@@ moti@@ fs , which led even to was@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cast them with chairs and threw the key federation on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ phe@@ w and very fre@@ ak guys , he has already regre@@ t@@ ted , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and exc@@ use them . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said to his honorary rescue that such educational methods were in the fra@@ ction@@ less time , the 1960s and 1970s , widespread in parents as with teachers . &quot;
do you still know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also have experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually in this report , namely , the def@@ ending sexual abuse and the violence at the pre@@ school , are the liber@@ ally excav@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; you wonder whether it is not rather to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness , and his role as a brother of Benedikt XV@@ I. , that many media had just moved on him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him , still eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
but the truth is : Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s report in every way !
&quot; in the media , the report was reported very much about the issue of abuse with the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also include any acquisition or co @-@ knowledge in terms of sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said an aff@@ ect@@ ant representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in the En@@ lighten@@ ment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent .
&quot; if they weren &apos;t even parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ spar@@ rows pupils rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student is form@@ ulated this way : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had a right @-@ term findings and would have been able to stop the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd , accept that , in fact , imp@@ uted him ... Bu@@ ben in urgent or clear@@ er or rather opened , than compared to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s@@ conduc@@ tors , confidenti@@ ality etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; in advance , affected students and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; so , regarding sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is concerned about any participation . &quot;
&quot; thus , it cannot be accused of having taken him , or to have brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; Viol@@ ec@@ z@@ essen &quot; was to read at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was accused of having said in the &quot; &quot; way@@ mark &quot; &quot; report . &quot;
does he have to live with this alleg@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem , that in the reporting everything was missing and ver@@ ted to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is just a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is clean separately : between the pre@@ school and the school of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence , we say once , other pre@@ dicts . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report inci@@ dents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades ago , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not a choir director of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where the boys of seasonal teachers were correct and mal@@ ign@@ ited , all of them have occurred on the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sk@@ andal@@ ous states have to have been observed . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium . &quot;
&quot; that was , like most witnesses , the theme of &quot; pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was no discipline there , but no sa@@ dist@@ al violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims inv@@ alu@@ able the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even have positive memory with him . &quot;
&quot; at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have taken away . &quot;
&quot; despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( as the witness ) would hear nothing , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
Georg R@@ atz@@ inger closed his ears in front of the conditions ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ y@@ mn@@ asium , which the report even re@@ produced . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he indicates that in the secondary school , he continued to pract@@ ise the test penalty . &quot;
&quot; in view of the risk of negative press public , he is urgent . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time , as a legal clarity , was also forbidden in Bavaria in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; before that occurred , they occurred in a legal gray zone , as everyone knows us well . &quot;
&quot; there was also hard to estimate that those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramatic , where the permissible limit has been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he would have gone away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , yes , it was un@@ fair to apply the educational standards for the time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann , we are talking about the &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so is the danger to evaluate past three moral dimensional units . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has already right .
&quot; however , of course , it does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ orted to all times , and not for what was broken in the pre@@ school of resistance and violence against innocent children &apos;s work , that goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally abandoned .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its means for discipl@@ ines and punishment , so ear@@ ns and ears to draw and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , it was then forbidden , he also kept silence on it . &quot;
&quot; what is the picture of his rainy days , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger has given me again in the talks with you for the book &quot; My Brother of the Pope ? &quot; &quot;
was the subject of testing also on the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told his perspective , there were only one side role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t worry , that he led a str@@ ingent regim@@ ent there . &quot;
&quot; but even this has to be said : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the un@@ demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of World Ran@@ kings , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one makes no big singer and there is no big singer and before any success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ crossing . &quot;
&quot; what kind of people , do you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in talks about their book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I experienced George R@@ atz@@ inger really well met and again experienced a wonderful , hum@@ orous , very deep belie@@ ver and heart@@ y people who could not imagine that he could only do a fly somewhat more . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still working today , 23 years after his retirement , regularly contact him , to visit him - he is almost blind - and how a member of her family treat . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t forgive him today , that he once was strictly confi@@ ded to them , so clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ en@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , v@@ amp@@ ant teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly it may be - but also a lov@@ able respect to him , to whom they still look up and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that one acc@@ uses to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad that we have already overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , only because he is promin@@ ently and has a prominent brother to make media sinners . &quot;
&quot; the evil int@@ ent that stands behind it is , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; because the report , which was just released , is un@@ loaded . &quot;
&quot; now there would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who would know great mer@@ its , and perhaps even in Germany no one would know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot;
