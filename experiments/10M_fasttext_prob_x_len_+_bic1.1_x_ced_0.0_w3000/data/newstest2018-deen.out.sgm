<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a FlickenteppI recognises as such as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the great transition card, towns and municipalities were registered for more detailed maps, so-called jungle leaves."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these originated according to the Bavarian surveying management between 1810 and 1864, and the first surveying of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the spring of 1800, the French armies occupied Bavaria since the Second Koalitioner War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bavaria in order - of course, for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops invaded the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: it was the present neighbours that created the idea of a covering Bavaria card.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV Joseph drove the project further, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische surveying management."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the Urinist sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856, and is like all the others on the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the comparison of the country / today, the regional capital is the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the city has grown up in all directions, and has grown together."</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is submerged, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the creation of the map, in 1877, as a Munich district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Subscriling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses were located around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the Bavarian farmers in Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the West Park is, you can see nothing but fields - at the first glance: when in the zooming, a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten pieces from the so-called" original photo "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots there are no farmers working there today, but small husbandmen of the plant in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Lower sendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 scene of the Oktoberfest, was actually a meadow and no concrete desert in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the Urinist dial reads in the field of today's Au-Haidhausen district, not only the street names" at Gasteig "or from the Anhöhe" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfield road, there was once people locked with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there was 1858 / 59, the Munich district of Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüders". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment of the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought to King Louis's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>

<seg id="37">"for 280 patients had been first place, later on 500 places it was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"sometime, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>

<seg id="50">Citizen legal Group published travelwarnings for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for promoting Farming has issued a warning for coloured people, who are travelling due to the discriminating politics and the racist attacks of the State after Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Committee for the State of Missouri, which is to enter into force until August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourianer, because a number of unquestionable, racial-based incident occurred throughout the state and can be noted here," says the group's opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently detective law of Missouri which makes it harder to capture Discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state who aim to release the tracefully on minorities, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, the people pass."</seg>
<seg id="55">"the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star said they will be put together because of their skin colour."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency which we haven't heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under unquestionable circumstances early in the beginning of the year, after completing the state no petrol had taken more and taken by the police of Missouri in custody, without being accused of crimes."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also refers to a recently published report of the office of the State Prosecution, which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and staff informed about what happened in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring it to the opportunity, or the relatives have to know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri recorded 100 supporters in the year 2015, according to the latest figures from the Hasselt-report program of the FBI, which occurred the state in terms of such injuries to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to complain about a company due to residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued a travel budgetes for Texas and Arizona after the states of immigration authorities committed to unite people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to the ACLU's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent times, stakeholders have used the measure as reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric gate project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher-fence-project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Group Peter White and Kordula Kovac have a picture in front of the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Schwendemann family members met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into its operation, which he has 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"Schwarzwaldmilk" is an alternative solution for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the cottages only comes regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since it is also BLHV-Chairman of Fisherbach, he called the" elemental project "as" elemental project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not profit on such a steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"green landmarks for a lot of work, much must be processed with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with topography," Schwendemann emphasised. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the elteral operation and approved this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it does not perform bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune has known the importance of the deception project, and is glad about the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope so that the view of the areas could still be gone out for a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and thoughts about how they bring forth their operation," the mayor stressed. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often standing in the critique</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open surface area amounts to 40 hectares, which will not be forwarded to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were promoted, a quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmer continued to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of the fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann declared. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" you do not make a really good job, without farmers and agriculture. "</seg>
<seg id="90">"for Peter White, too:" best foods are produced. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-farming (lpr) Baden-Württemberg enables state support of wheat fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr recorded conveyor belt.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the injected area should not be able to be disable (Hanging over 35 percent) and must be threatened by hanging."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing billing project 2018, the application of eight participants are running 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the open area is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is now taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime change is, when they begin to attack statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's place on the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-regime, certainly knew what he did when he did a symbolic axe in a heat dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals to the drastic restriction of the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller does not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boilers and Liberty-Imitators would have landed him if it had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta labeled:" I don't want to go on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which enlightened the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was later added and not part of the original statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but how it formulated it, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary response to the inflamed words of Lazarus, the only one, in which a state not only invites any ancient immigrants, but the trouble of the poor:" "your garbage, your poor, and your arms, which are looking for, to breathe freely, / the ending waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elty waste" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he did not make sure that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural meditation: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who wanted to place their words after her death on the base - knew very good that it has been a high-political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicism, in which they presented the female embodiment of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And there is a very different name: mother of the exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The association's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change that long before the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big Schreier than Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty should invite you to bring the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty is moving forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not lighten the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Pretty unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and a question of standing perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great phantasial effect of Lazarus was in it to see them as they had seen from the exhausting, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, the world is to see the world from perspective of people who seek refuge and improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue says to them the words of hope, and of the will they hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not give the way to shine, but the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when just two sots of the UK belonged to the UK.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance of athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world champion is a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue until we'll find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Buttes - who was elected to Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m circuit, while Eiliie Doyle was chosen from the team to the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captive speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish, or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"passion and the genuine feeling, the Eiliie of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdle, says that it is" unbelievable "is that 16 chots are in the British crew."</seg>
<seg id="145">"the best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distances Muir performs on this path and has placed five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m rounds."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m running, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary games, should observe."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first World Championships as the only other Schotte team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team capitalists says that they are" enormously proud "to the fact that many of their countrymen do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also at the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"that is so special about the team of team to be in it, that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that my team-mates voted for me and chosen me, making it something very special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I'm very proud of all the jackets that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to Podes."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech concerns about capitalist?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"therefore, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from that we are again in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out and compete there, and it's just a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking Critics via Facebook: do not work for a public office when you do not wear it from voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of its policy up to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he slipped in criticism, safe."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of freedom can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we become like sheep for battles. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland Larry Hogan, who must work on it to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked contributions from at least 450 people and have deleted their opinion on its official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties accused him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as a frivol, and the online commentary was full of a counterreaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second-second approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a fixed hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the block of persons who come on the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially called and of employees working with public tax-dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokesperson Amelia Chasse argued the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or chambers, or hasshoped people that swing online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no scroll."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not benefited."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarani from Bowie, Md., was not hassorted, but she asked to hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current messages," she wrote in the commentary area of the message "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if there is a number of people on the same subject, then they will be used by some more than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the governor as" concentrated spam attack "would call others most likely" intercere. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, when one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical heads and to burn, or to put protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But exactly that happens now digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise that he has criticised Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County, the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they had a voters out of their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter pens hit his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous Troll.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius, "and" Portius, "wrote all letters to newspapers, Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the contract of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, according to the historical documents that were collected by the online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put them silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of freedom, opinion, and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept this.</seg>

<seg id="1320">"before, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>

<seg id="1323">I have loved it in love and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room estate with a screwed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the spacious ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, much light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"to this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi made from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge in it was to create a mezzanine which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel plant is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arranged that they were stacked on each other, without leaving us."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height or below the right height."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement enabled Erfan, place two rooms in full height, with a lot of additional drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic copper light windows of Retrouvius via the glamorous living area.</seg>

<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to work it longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the reflector feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units for all the corner and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to perception of a glamorous noise, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">So special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went in," explains Erfan from the stahlenhancing, fearful MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so it's when you push the door on the door, very easily glow."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to cleverable use of space and storage room, Joanne could win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or like your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate masts will enter and perform calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they made it to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high-quality materials that make room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and therefore helping to create an emotional ties into a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love yourself in the electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if yes, he will be the first."</seg>

<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, joined his first working day with leading employees, he introduced a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information that fall into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others tried to tame Trump, performing its media coverage."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television is enough for decades - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when Candidate was offended due to an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that was to convince the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February, opposite the POLITICO."</seg>

<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever "was" under control "is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these combat agents don't know anything we do not know - that Trumps Tweets have included even more ignition material without their interventions yet.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably learn something about Tweets that Trump is not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees create it a few times, trouble of him, then their efforts have landed."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has to prevent it consistently, that Trump controversy is called."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem exists in that human beings are present in a white house, which will always try to present their own agenda by using trump material that promotes its views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"with this story, POLITICO has been dealing with this story - in May about the preference of the adviser, the President of strategic reasons desperate information."</seg>

<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press coverage, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he would come out to find out where these originates."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly that happened at the end of February, when someone accused a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh," the source behind a heap of his leaks "at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banned from Twitter permanently from Twitter, or that he has not sold any concrete evidence, or that he has sold false allegations in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh.</seg>

<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>

<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still aiming to influence."</seg>

<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago, that the special educator Trump personally got into the centre and find the accusation, whether the president may not hinder the judiciary."</seg>

<seg id="1816">"there are drugs mugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals which make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there are no rest of violence, and throughout the country the corpses are increasingly more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, and now there were at least seven dead in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her inspirator of Rioce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest error is to live in Mexico and journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is received deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice "," T-Shirts, who will show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian face. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and the reporter discuss their shared topics that trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010, a special prosecutor's Office was built to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for Protection of journalists only led two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, who are connected every year with drug trafficking and organic crimes, the murderers of journalists are only rarely tried."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rioce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa while they are inseparable and although the terrain is still traitors."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know, we don't know."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was forced out of two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot up for 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" 12th river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The contactor drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing about the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrested the past year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rivaled fractions fight here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot at the streets or that the cemetery is full of displaced, two-story Mausoleen for drugs, who are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only one Kartell has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, with the blame that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstanding have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first in February, the publication of a interviews with Damasco Lopez, a leader of a rivalled cartel fractions in the war with Guzmans's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may be offended with the sons, the gangsters bought each copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to force Valdez, after the capture of another newspaper, which had published the same story, left the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues got that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste as he joined the founding of Rioce together with five colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without hesitation, "" Bojorquez said. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper served a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it, hard to publish research without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that no one can handle anything else."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Rioce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis "for its coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage at the persecution of the Mexican drug history, where ever she led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave voluntarily to that he had fear.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue to live," "he said to the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trade in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in the past October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must adopt the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked," "What did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce-Team missed Valdez, the Spaßvogel, who was like a harbour worker, the friend who had generously with hugs and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted on his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now she asks: was his love for routine to be routine?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to ask her own instructions in question, how they can do their work at best and staying alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their home start and landing ways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-sufficiency and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, such as he and others say, in Sinaloa no more - as not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, in which a toxic blend of lucrative muggelroucks, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Rioce met for security training, suddenly there were no cell phones allowed. days earlier, Spyware that is sold exclusively on governments, used for monitoring of journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Two policemen sought refuge in front of the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a Victorian building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in a joke, some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen who called the governor itself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporter have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug bound de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the output of this week, Rioce has put on three main layers."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the government spending, focused on the hometown of the Governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that led in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about it, who was kidnapped, or as it happened, so be careful to write, as it was time to write, what each in the town knows: that the restaurant is a favourite locally of drug traffickers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public recordings that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of being charged with corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter, about previous incidents in this local restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman was deferred to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers had seen the column of Valdez as the best informal source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we knew what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El FLACO "because of its slender body."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, who protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something that they have never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Replica Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the Office of the Prosecutor's office.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists were stronger than they have written in organised protests" SOS Press. ""</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to express journalists and let them kill them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is redivided by the government, because she is concerned, her anger has injured their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico signed from organisational crimes, involved government officials and a parvalid society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug abuse, but also on the command of politicians and security forces who were with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>

<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug events with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home country or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as it apparently revealed to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, even a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers found that the first findings of the incredible rhinocorns of a Canadian miners were so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even realize that his fury skin of rubbery was brown - and they said they would have had something from a" unquiet past. ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described him as" the incubated dinosaurs, who ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"the researchers invented it as a" really remarkable ","</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the gepante plant species is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock on the Platze, and decided to look more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"the Fossil discovered by him, was sent into the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology."</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only a little bit with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the principal author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It is going to enter history as one of the most beautiful and best dinosaurs copies - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found out that this plant leaves, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a convertible breastplate, probably threatened by meat-nivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves before predators, and used a paratross which is used as counterburial, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have been allowed to blend better in its surroundings and to avoid his enemies, experts, what indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creation from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now on the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now have studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing conservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of sheds and armaments over his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the consterning, a widespread defense method in the animal, meaning that the tip of the creature darker was dark than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shady is usual, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals alive today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by enough pressure through flesh-vorous dinosaurs, that evolution increased the wear of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the contentions - think of Rehe, Zebras or Gürteleveh - are much smaller and injurious than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behaviour on a massive, strong dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have to have been to have been" said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs wrie was rotten.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on his life, including his controversial Darminhaltes, to figure out what it was eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and was cast into the sea, where he fell on the back to the sea floor."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was so warm as South-fluorida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much more inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is fully covered with conserviced skin, but also in three dimensions remain and the original form of the Tieres retains", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"the result is, that the animal looks almost exactly as in the early chalk time."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need much imagination to design it. if you only have a little bit with the eyes, you could believe that he is sleeping in sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when huge thermal periods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived million years after Borealopelta, the gearing dinosaurs was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"it belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was sank after the death in the sea, and in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the preserved dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle until thigh."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips made by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">Researchers believe that the armored plant concreed through western Canada was flooded through the flooded river in the open sea until an overflooded river.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs keep his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The distressed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house are still hollow mowing plates along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic is such a level of preserving so 'seldom like a win in lotto.</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it will."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Sulated remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot is on his side, his five fingers crossed up to the top."</seg>

<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder, which we have accustomed to us and we can call it typically."</seg>
<seg id="2036">"in that moment, I felt shochills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>

<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23: 00, she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided to drive the two next morning to Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "" "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and protest, the love and the losses, the strength and the resistance, which consists of the sight of people living in the community, and the streets filled to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell ran with her daughter who carried a flower dress and a suitable crown to Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" above the black experience and the black condition. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I have taught you when black people have to fight, what they believe in?" "she remembered that which she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we go to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy, and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not bring them away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"it has to know, and see it."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the lucky enough to give her an experience in which she is personally experienced, it is not different than the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove you a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station which was waiting for a campground, when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge officer of the Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business partners there, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after the 9th of August," "she said and notices that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It's all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met in an evening demonstration of Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came Ferrell in the sense: "do you want to document or try to find a story which you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often from the White - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" we had heard that people who have been born in Ferguson and raised up their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment, Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other locals, followed the team of" Whose Streets? ""</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, as I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells's experience - to show that it is not a Messiah guide, but for a community that come together," "said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelle's life, as she loves himself and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain things in this work, and with the human protection of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history is repeating the role of black tails women in the broader Black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenage camp Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify itself as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," said Ferrell, "and therefore we fight at different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" the movement really is kept standing by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "by the Ferrell chosen as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, even though it was at the front front, because with a life on these cruises than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can sense your energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the racial connections between the congregation and the police continue."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on the currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"she describes the social atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she klets herself on a song, and she feels committed to this memory, since she went into Ferguson for three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "magnitude": TV-reader discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, even though it was not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the South of the pedestrian zone split up the population in advocates and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" is discussed the subject.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say:" it would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "it would be really great" "(Nicole Schausten), coming from the other side:" don't need a man "" (Siggi Baking) or simply: "size wahn!" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates building on that a gallery will take more customers into the city, of which other businesses are benefited, the enemy fear that the pedestrian zone is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition: the gallery is planned precisely on the property, where the farm market stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the start of the construction work, it will be conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-Macher want to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to the Beda square with a possibility to sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"Simone rooms:" we've been selling almost weekly in the peasant market for many years. "</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cake of land women are very happy again."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also have discovered the butcher for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to wish that, while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "the direct marker in a market hall in the gallery will come on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">But that should not be low in the new project.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping spreader in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, dropping - or supermarkets: I think it's superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You see how many shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is the more important that at least the Markthalle remains at least."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"because after all, the product offered is fresh, mostly offered directly from the producer, and is purely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping center is rented only by larger companies, because the local rents are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"shame, special stores, is almost no more and that which is still left, will probably disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a Markthalle fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the peasant market during the construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old EDEKA would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery is actually actually coming.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already make the ghosts bit Gallery before to drive all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center that is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no place for a peasant rock music - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg has no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market is made, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A perfect similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown that hang almost infinite - which hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuesern and Haarcuttons made by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analysts had served a 35-year sentence, after she publicly made diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance (An appropriate similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted to its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a Transition and pioneering discretion, whose sentence was converted by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg created by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA produced by Manning, and out of the 30 portraits, such as someone could not only look at the formability of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the infirmities Determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"in 2013, Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, has already been convicted of the identification as a woman, was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the spying law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only a single photo - a grain, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is deliberately sitting on a driver seat and a platinblonde bargain - which was associated with them."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portraits of foreigners produced from forenian artifacts such as cigar-ummel and chewing gum by extract the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of which people might look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "Dewey-Hagborg stated at a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her incarcerated muse were displeased several letters in the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo Illustriced Comic" Supplied Images, "which would foresee a future in which the President Cheliodour would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manners release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happier meetings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"it is also available at the opening of the exhibition, some deep and starkes, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camps and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid column which he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the weird timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for Manning with their superior signature (the" i "in her family name is an end of the" automatic fragmentation, which are based on gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousands of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, showing the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific Lexicon of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hope to take away is that our genome don't care about, who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," "Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories also said."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in an own room, is one side from the above mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as they appears with a Freisprechtelefon in the hand of the disciplines of the United States, such as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they chill your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never do the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist who greets from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I'm still looking at all, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally, as it was supposed to be taken in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed into the center of space by their own genomic Simulakras, who like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted as all in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), with which their genetic aploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd's crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said by the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, as the movement, which was behind the liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robot are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take their rise seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make it funny, but the company deliver every quantity of it, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey at the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">"modern Sexpuppen have developed themselves from their inflatable partners to robots using a silicone skin, which feels warm - with conscious human reactions that will be achieved by artificial intelligence."</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can adjust his robot accordingly to its beliefs" "and to all choose from the eye-color of the robot over the form of breast warts up to type or colour of its fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there will still be disruptive, because many robots would have the" personalities "that would look progressive to the stepford-woman."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed to robots using a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot makes it possible for example to adapt its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as intoxicity."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"its emergence and its increasing refinement point to something dark and deep in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal basis of gender equality to a wish for sex with lower than optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men are of course no sex robot, and while the FRR notice their rising popularity, they still remain in the edge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what was leakage out of the Random zones, in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very educational."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until they are the free market for this purpose."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overcutting that these highly developed sex robots are immersed in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in which the White House has a president to have attacked women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the terrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic pictures, the swallowed body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision seems."</seg>

<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robots exists, there is a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their inheritance would like to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammation)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet which is rich in flesh-based proteins and dairy products, the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases could lineup."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the inevitable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected are usually come to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan found out that the essential amino acid Tryptophan were able to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut patrol stated that harmful microbes, which hide themselves in the food, do not enter into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells, who are able to destroy inflammation, are balanced out of cells that protect the tolerance and protect the body, without sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when equilibrium is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, a kind of tolerance enhancing immunodeficiency occurs in mice that carry out a particular bacterium in its initiate."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more Tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had their immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan rich diet tolerate, less inflamed intestinal milieus, when the same system also work with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral prizes in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan controlled a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study powers had such cells, but another group of the same stem but had not been accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"you suspected that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbioms of mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungus, who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice were created DNA sequential and there were six bacterium species found in mice with the immune cells, but without they were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were tucked up in a sterilen environment so that they were missing an intestinal microbiom and they did not developed this type of immune cells and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria improved to the immune system, the researchers added L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then brought small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on an unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells were developed to tolerate cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be known as an annex product of tryptophan Metabolism, which is known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when the tryptophandicapped were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerating cells like mice, and that most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract. "</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-side products from L. reuteri found cells in people such as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" the development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote, since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the Darms. "</seg>

<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was described by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>

<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domenatzen were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausivity" victims of overprint, 67 Domenatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, Germany:" summarize can therefore hold that by Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"at high Emotionality, the punishment for the pupils could also fall off."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to many others, in contrast to many others, many victims invoked the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked to him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann declared why the final report to the misbreeder scandal at the Regensburger Domenatzen Georg Ratzinger was discharged in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" Incidents of Violin Exercise at the Regensburger Domenatzen "" there is a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for a lift, many students lift up his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"as a result, he also appears as a choleriker and Perfectist who became the öfteren, when a Domspatz has no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you read the effort and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask themselves, why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"to him, eight pages are dedicated and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of Mittal or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The nonviolence at the school event occurred outside of its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to discard it, too late, or did not take advantage of it seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzymnasium, which he worked, was experienced by practically all respondents than - literally -" salvation, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his student Georg Ratzinger also describes a very excellent witness," "popular", "excellent," "competent, and" understandable teacher, who served the guys regularly with cakes, cookies and bonbons and were always surrounded by grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is worth its perfectionism and its high Emotifs, which led even to wasps."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only cast them with chairs and threw the key federation on the floor, but also earnephew and very freak guys, he has already regretted, deeply regretted and excuse them."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said to his honorary rescue that such educational methods were in the fractionless time, the 1960s and 1970s, widespread in parents as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also have experienced this in a worldly school, a state school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually in this report, namely, the defending sexual abuse and the violence at the preschool, are the liberally excavators."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"you wonder whether it is not rather to do with his acquaintness, and his role as a brother of Benedikt XVI., that many media had just moved on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who never understood him, still eagerly awaited."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: Georg Ratzinger's report in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, the report was reported very much about the issue of abuse with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also include any acquisition or co-knowledge in terms of sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have entrusted to the Domenellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or my mother," "said an affectant representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the Enlightenment of sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they weren't even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domsparrows pupils rate Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student is formulated this way: "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had a right-term findings and would have been able to stop the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd, accept that, in fact, imputed him... Buben in urgent or clearer or rather opened, than compared to their parents, internatsconductors, confidentiality etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report comes to the very clear result:" "in advance, affected students and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"so, regarding sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is concerned about any participation."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it cannot be accused of having taken him, or to have brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to bring his good name to these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" Violeczessen "was to read at the Regensburger Domenatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger was accused of having said in the" "waymark" "report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this allegation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem, that in the reporting everything was missing and verted to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is just a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is clean separately: between the preschool and the school of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence, we say once, other predicts."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades ago, in which Georg Ratzinger was not a choir director of the Domsparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful test pedagogy, the cases where the boys of seasonal teachers were correct and malignited, all of them have occurred on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really skandalous states have to have been observed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspatzymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"that was, like most witnesses, the theme of" preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was just happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzymnasium school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was no discipline there, but no sadistal violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims invaluable the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even have positive memory with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at most, the accusation remains to have taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and from the predecessors at a school where he did not work and was responsible (as the witness) would hear nothing, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Georg Ratzinger closed his ears in front of the conditions?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of Domspatzymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this way, he indicates that in the secondary school, he continued to practise the test penalty."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the risk of negative press public, he is urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time, as a legal clarity, was also forbidden in Bavaria in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that occurred, they occurred in a legal gray zone, as everyone knows us well."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also hard to estimate that those affected might be exaggerated or dramatic, where the permissible limit has been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he would have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test penalty was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, yes, it was unfair to apply the educational standards for the time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann, we are talking about the" Fallstrick of Anachronism, "so is the danger to evaluate past three moral dimensional units."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"however, of course, it does not apply to sexual abuse that was aborted to all times, and not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence against innocent children's work, that goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I'm glad that it is finally abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its means for disciplines and punishment, so earns and ears to draw and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, it was then forbidden, he also kept silence on it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what is the picture of his rainy days, Georg Ratzinger has given me again in the talks with you for the book" My Brother of the Pope? ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject of testing also on the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, told his perspective, there were only one side role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't worry, that he led a stringent regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this has to be said: without these perfectionism, without the undemanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of World Rankings, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition that went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and Bonbons alone, one makes no big singer and there is no big singer and before any success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-crossing."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of people, do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in talks about their book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I experienced George Ratzinger really well met and again experienced a wonderful, humorous, very deep believer and hearty people who could not imagine that he could only do a fly somewhat more."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former Domsparrows are still working today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly contact him, to visit him - he is almost blind - and how a member of her family treat."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who don't forgive him today, that he once was strictly confided to them, so clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domenatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, vampant teacher - a stringent father, certainly it may be - but also a lovable respect to him, to whom they still look up and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that one accuses to him are educational methods that were at the time of the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have already overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, only because he is prominently and has a prominent brother to make media sinners."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intent that stands behind it is, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"because the report, which was just released, is unloaded."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now there would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired a 93-year-old man who would know great merits, and perhaps even in Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace."</seg>
