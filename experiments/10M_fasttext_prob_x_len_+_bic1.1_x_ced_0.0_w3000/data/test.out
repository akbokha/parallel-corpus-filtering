&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , divided the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco with that Frank who had worked as a chef in Boston in front of six months ago as chef at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that she sho@@ cked , sho@@ cked and destroyed over his death . &quot;

Jennifer Ani@@ ston : I will always put in drawers .
Jennifer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star in an interview right now .
&quot; I will always put on drawers in drawers , or be glu@@ ed from the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t have the wish , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather car@@ c@@ ous . &quot;
Jennifer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan . &quot;
&quot; most of the actress spend their time at home , the TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , is called it in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white gl@@ ut , they bring the question after the children &apos;s request : &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child game &quot; is Ani@@ ston as a sole mother of two sons .
the film runs on the 25th of August .
Gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger moved with some colleagues a little variety with a ride on the beach . &quot;
&quot; for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere . &quot;
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after some minutes , the horses remembered her holiday evening , they hunt home in fast g@@ opp home to the feed . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and thus the riding career ended , then again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany was the best gold of all times - 101 tournament victories - again close to horses . &quot;
&quot; he left his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t s@@ nap up for a photo . &quot;
for a long time the first time in Aachen and this was also the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports relief measures the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small Gala of Golden Sport pyramid .
&quot; at awards , it s@@ ails the sympath@@ etic sport@@ s@@ men . &quot;
&quot; federal service , silver , bay leaf , Champions @-@ tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has kissed him .
the 18th pri@@ ze@@ winners of the Sports pyramid is a long time .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means me much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger promotes the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so , he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sport@@ s@@ men , the two @-@ fold US mast winner was awarded the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ ls and Harald Schmit@@ t , the F@@ real Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ gh@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ ek@@ e , the J@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ um of the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard admir@@ ably . &quot;
many of these sporting events were come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ate society moved into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept the distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ ique and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - that &apos;s both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosoph@@ ical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small , and warns that the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; Clinton would climb the economy to death and regulate to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; however , he himself would be different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return Reg@@ ulations , and he stands for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to meet , he has trained ben@@ evol@@ ving opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in which must be inv@@ ests , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost the same . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ ber@@ in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are denied by the state @-@ critical te@@ ac@@ y wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
so on Tr@@ ump could thus come to party discussions .
clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal plants and re@@ bo@@ ating coal transport in the USA .
&quot; in so far protected areas , oil promotion should also be possible to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement . &quot;
Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program explicitly and calls : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be China , Germany or America - I want to be there . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , which come to travel @-@ fish trade agreements , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the USA would not want to is@@ olate from international trade , but simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , for instance , for instance . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7,@@ 25 US dollars is a hungry . &quot;
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump in this question is to do is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be r@@ assed , then he says he would not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to de@@ vote the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him , so the budget deficit would only be larger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich man wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every fle@@ dged woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; if they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ matic . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
&quot; in a large kitchen , four women are sitting . &quot;
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in the arm .
he looks curious with big eyes in the room .
his mother star@@ ved on the table plate .
until they notice that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kissed the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the executive director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social aux@@ iliary agencies in Bavaria , and among other things are women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are fle@@ dged .
&quot; they live in the Munich North , one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Guide . &quot;
she was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who comes here , has made his escape experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted , because they are torture or death , or because their families were sending them as hopes to Europe , &quot; she tells her . &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many steal away secretly because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experience with sexual violence , forced , honorary moral , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
on the run goes on .
&quot; for example , the tu@@ g demands a bottle of water for a bottle of water is no rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; whoever believes that the end , as soon as they come in Germany , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , all women in refugee camps would often be regarded as a min@@ der@@ ous and worst in case . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich north , is trau@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women were so great that they say nothing .
&quot; or they do not trust , openly about the living , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; often they are often unable to help , there are more accommodations only for them , calls B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question , whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , answer some with No . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz region and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are not something in accommodations for governments . &quot;
&quot; in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press @-@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Sub@@ - and Middle fran@@ ken , there are some shared floors or houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated separately . &quot;
&quot; if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there may be too - ongoing - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; especially the shower room should be separated , and for women easily accessible , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much women feel this protective needs , you can read the And@@ rang &apos;s House in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have spoken around , we have a long queu@@ e , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could make a second house easily .
assist@@ ants st@@ resses : recei@@ v@@ ables for new working measures
&quot; members of the assist@@ ants have called their union to discuss new labour measures in their disp@@ utes regarding a new contract . &quot;
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has demanded its entire Council starting from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that it was a minister to leave on the wor@@ ries of the contract .
&quot; in July , assist@@ ants and medical students have agreed on the ref@@ us@@ al of a contract signed by the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who have voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the President of J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said that the government had remained quiet &quot; to problems that the contract was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; In view of the J@@ DC Executive Board , the proposed new contract has agreed to reject and official new negotiations to all E@@ uren concerns . &quot;
&quot; as a response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board has put a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council for a running program of escal@@ ating work , which begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the disp@@ utes led to the fact that assist@@ ants achieved six times , the first total fail@@ ures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , came to the re@@ jection of the agreed contract conditions that were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jeremy Hunt , said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors were forced to be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Relations &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of eight months , to pro@@ claim the words of the words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counter@@ actor in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Pal@@ ast@@ es in reception , I cannot defend myself this prop@@ iti@@ ation in most . &quot;
&quot; it gave the hand , yes . &quot;
but Putin &apos;s smile worked nar@@ ro@@ li@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated heat for its rest@@ rained conditions .
&quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper , that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved this way , would never happen to happen . &quot;
&quot; in me , his enthusiasm appeared to indicate the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cows showed that the Russian President of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his project words : the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ishing .
Putin sent out and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back .
&quot; the going was even bigger , as it was committed by a missed friend . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ etr@@ able building , it becomes difficult , if not even impossible . &quot;
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the nation@@ ally controlled media led a strong , unlimited attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once again , the Turks would bear to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ations of leading officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family have benef@@ ited from illegal oil trading in the provinces of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a ce@@ ase@@ fire is clear on the hand . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan takes place in the first line of all friends , which he can get after the last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost his sentence . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economical moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel organizers and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights are resumed . &quot;
they are counting on a late seasonal accumulation of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the State television broad@@ casts fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated it as follows : &quot; tourists there for long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it considers the reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the persistent Gro@@ ll on the snow @-@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke is to move from cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security that he asked for a coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the chosen state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is true for Moscow , a self @-@ understand@@ able , which even change a deep fear of regime . &quot;
&quot; the summit meeting this glorious palace in this glorious palace in the ocean allowed Russia and Turkey , as it was a analysts at the &quot; Alliance of Foreign side &quot; : two countries that put away from the West and will feel bad . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still large differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support mutual sites . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of first talks on the press conference , both President told them that they had not even stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey missed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
&quot; there is no clear con@@ sensus above , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found to Syria . &quot;
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , NATO member of Turkey dis@@ car@@ ded the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland are no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a backup role according to the Bank of Staff .
the Royal Bank of Scotland is not available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan divided the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand had been connected to the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
&quot; the Bank has since dist@@ anced since then , when they had almost collapsed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other final consumer brands . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of Po@@ unds to Spon@@ sor@@ ing from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands in the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland is only available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the Bör@@ s@@ enn@@ ot@@ ation to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; at BBC Scotland , he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will be busy as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we are now more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global targets , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these stamps will be completely different in their own communities for something completely different , and our staff will work among these brands with customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer run its Six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his sport Spon@@ sor@@ ing .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop the brand of brands , as how do we focus on inside ( we asked ) to do this to a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the board of Staff . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical three years ago when we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can again launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market growth . &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spray champagne after a double by New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in the flat .
&quot; Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son follows . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I am landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; there is no big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ quet Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the Ju@@ bel when he re@@ covering the victory of Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ ey@@ s reached the milestone in the obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ ol@@ es@@ ie@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the Modern and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone just a few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ le@@ ct that distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm for enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been thr@@ illed for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already brought 6,000 gains if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey would be ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has won nearly 30 years winner in UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of British fla@@ x since two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole number of big tur@@ ni@@ ers win , including his famous &quot; glorious seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ad@@ diction . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he returned to difficulties when he returned from his six months to Sper@@ re , but he showed an impressive strength to resist its branches and to return to his best . &quot;
and he is still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to keep up at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fired power of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
the Russian President Vladimir Putin is un@@ expect@@ edly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a lot of years of close confidence in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed for the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without indication of reasons &quot; the dis@@ miss@@ al Ivan@@ ov@@ s ordered by its duties as Chairman of the Russian presidential management . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been the deputy since 2012 Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy was appointed to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital , Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was later director and the head of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state , and controls to the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday with that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V therefore asked that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V therefore asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time of the most eng@@ aging trusted Vladimir Putin and works as he was working for the Soviet secret service of the K@@ GB .
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of the smile for the cameras , there are only few of them - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so is the result of a kind of power fighting ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that one man , who was once promised as potential president , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - thrust towards large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , cited on the website of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said it is true that I was asked to talk about this very complicated item in early 2012 - you could almost say - to trust for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V increased the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin is former member of State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onal Service ( FS@@ B ) , who set the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , to whom he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once again , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was adopted after Putin &apos;s second term President of Russia , as a third term of putting Putin to the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin was Prime Minister before he became President three and a half years later .
Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gibson was fired after completing producers

myst@@ eries to fish that landed in the gardens in Ban@@ ff
a inhabitants of Ban@@ ff demanded the identification of the fish help in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could be in the 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were spread out of a fountain of fountain .

Queens@@ en Crossing : bridge is now connected to Fi@@ bers
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Queens@@ en Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is connected to fi@@ fe now .
&quot; it is the first of four se@@ ams of the &quot; covers , &quot; the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge of fi@@ ves is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 metric tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 shr@@ ubs . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Keith Brown was a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to come from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment at the construction of Queens@@ en Cros@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineering art from a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the hose between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the pass . &quot;
&quot; a total of almost 79 % of the total bridge on their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks get a concrete bed for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted to his place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ stru@@ ctors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in each bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project represents the cl@@ asp forward @-@ looking high@@ - and civil engineering .
&quot; after the installation of the last street cover and its connection with the expansion of the Northern tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern hemisphere at 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; solid , since the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs approx . 6,000 tons and had to be drawn up at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , because the toler@@ ances in which the team works , tiny - on each side , they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
luck@@ ily everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; lucky to be alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown by her fishing boat before Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI life@@ jacket took place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulty in safety , while their boat moved from their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and set us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds ble@@ ach the boat out of their range until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted from 60 and on a boat was found without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the coastal area and were brought back to rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water were lucky , and to be alive and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat motor had a stop@@ over , however , this disin@@ teg@@ rated at the boiler of the Bo@@ ots by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has grown today about these men today .
heavy hurt - husband sp@@ ill on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police attacked yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the keys to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he came twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in the hand and hurt the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; while the 50 year old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ friend , he called his mother . &quot;
this al@@ ar@@ ming then asked her sister .
&quot; together with her life , the 45 year old wanted to calm their brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
&quot; therefore , she went out of the house with her life . &quot;
&quot; on the road , they met the ex @-@ CV of the man . &quot;
&quot; as the two women again entered the apartment , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old has his sister to the side and his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green : investors shall be much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Bruns@@ wick will lose almost 1,300 homes in the next few years ?
the SPD strikes for the next rating of a &quot; action concept . &quot;
but contro@@ versy is programmed .
first line is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing .
&quot; Christoph Brat@@ mann stated : &quot; we are living with the Gre@@ ens : &quot; &quot; who wants to build us with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build in urban areas , 20 percent of all flats have to be held as social housing . &quot;
&quot; the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the great dispute in the town hall is , however , Fr@@ mann : &quot; how are you going to build with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to build investors on such land at least 10 percent , but as possible 20 per cent of dwellings are building as a social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing programme that will cost millions costs and will be paid yet to inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; the problem , so Fr@@ mann : &quot; there are currently no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU wants to make investors as a few regulations as possible .
the left will still be tough@@ ness for investors .
&quot; regardless of him , so Brat@@ mann , the cream has a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; when implemented , the concept concept is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
yet the program does not yet stand fully : for the approx . 12@@ 60 new apartments that should be ready to be built .
&quot; but how do you compare the loss of more about 1,300 inexpensive apartments , whose funding will run out in the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the planned speaking spokesperson Nicole Palm , should now be purchased from the city now . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get back into the prices again . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
to have a blow to solve the problem .
&quot; because in the West town , the end of the end of Fri@@ es are running . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , you could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : those want the owners who are residential companies not .
&quot; since then , the number of social flats in the western city is dra@@ stically increased , is removed from the target of the so @-@ called flow . &quot;
a concentration of social weak in just a few city parts will not give it anymore .
&quot; thus , the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in discussion . &quot;
&quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; for a broad majority , the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for single family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that te@@ ens and child are no longer going to go outside , but rather rather prefer@@ able to spend their free time to spend on screens , was compl@@ ained in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; with Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about to get people from the sofa and get more active . &quot;
&quot; at first time the screen was on the TV , then on video games and recently limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and activities do not exclu@@ de each other . &quot;
&quot; I am looking forward to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , a app that is based on the characters that initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later formed out of it a cartoon animation , playing cards and other Sp@@ in @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop@@ culture sank the interest before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand , which over@@ loaded the server . &quot;
&quot; within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone outside and looking for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons who have been tra@@ ced with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screenshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the quest of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that return the &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , the 35.000 users divided , the Washington Post announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of people pursued by 45 per cent to 53 per cent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for the performance .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to come &quot; &quot; to be active from the sofa &quot; and &quot; every day actively to be bo@@ red , because many public messages come to health , and they come from people who look like . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly casts sport , reduces his chances to prevent cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps with weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of advantages that is too long to perform them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine and fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friends .
&quot; as always , there are m@@ ür@@ rical games corrupt , which must always complain about anything . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smart apps could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
the New will lose his appeal and use the use with the time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active world in the real world and so many people will help the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es manages gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .

Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .

effort@@ lessly on the beams .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now also Olympic champion .
&quot; the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ om@@ m on Thursday , for multi @-@ campaign events and enlarged the gap between itself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spot@@ light of the Olympic Games . &quot;
the overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 198 was clearly evident in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ a Ra@@ is@@ man and Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es takes place on the Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ es during the individual campaign of women in the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins with a multi @-@ fight player and a total of fifth , while they fixed their reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when their final result was shown and their long journey was at the end . &quot;
&quot; this success makes them in the same League as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , which have brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es dominated the last three years of their sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing exercises that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she has ever seen &quot; the best gy@@ mn@@ ast which I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expecting a final inspection in Brazil , a competition that went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace her , after they have won gold and silver in the individual campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first coin on Tuesday , while on the farewell ceremony of his retirement in retirement , Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as an ex@@ clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted on the top of their long way@@ mark on the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ ble Pass - is based on Latin American music that would fit home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , which was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip into the gy@@ mn@@ asium , in the Bo@@ or@@ man trained . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has no more multi @-@ winning competition , a winning series , which is as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two fil@@ ings , the image moved . &quot;
Schwe@@ be@@ bal@@ ks and Bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which bil@@ es will hold the world championship title .
&quot; again , she returned with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig &apos;s back and sat down with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her as she expected her final - a pure form@@ ality - and tears went on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that they once described in their colle@@ c@@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when it fought for the third place , but the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ aille was in a low @-@ angle of Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams , who is called O@@ ma , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after their ground exercise , it threw the audience to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes doub@@ tful . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , twe@@ et twe@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old from the beginning of this week has a very new meaning : &quot;
police : 3 victims in series production at the music was shot in the car
&quot; according to police report , which were released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series of production of Phoenix , while they stopped by car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was par@@ ked in a drive , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the do@@ er fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ man , while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police divided that the triple murder seems not to be the result of a pre@@ dat@@ or , because the att@@ ack@@ ers did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officers of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ators , led to the investig@@ ator , whether it is associated with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in h@@ isp@@ anic areas in nine attacks seven people and two injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to open the evidence that they were linked to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , died due to their injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died still on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a certain car and listen to music . &quot;
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting in which an empty pic@@ up truck went out half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the plant &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen and secured a ball from the seat as well as glob@@ es from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with Micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his aging , Edmund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , knew nothing about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought , I create that . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I did not leave me .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her has been told that Edmund can never recognize them under the circumstances and that he might not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they struck him to institutional .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help to help .
Edmund could not sit up to his third year neither sitting nor cro@@ oked and he cannot speak yet .
but he makes a slow progress .
he can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Edmund opted for &quot; Please sing me something &quot; before . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but there is no typical character language -- it says . Edmund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ y has a multitude of causes : genetic , as well as infections with viruses , such as meas@@ les or Z@@ ic@@ avirus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and forec@@ asting may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say as it will influence life with the Z@@ ic@@ avirus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked what happened to happen ?
what will happen ?
and they don &apos;t really know .
&quot; I have been asked for a long time since a long time , because I did not expect that someone really can say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth damage caused by Z@@ ik@@ avirus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Louisiana , are reaching a record level after the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could overcome many houses in the subur@@ ban on Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a current floods in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish is a danger , since these rivers are slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;

&quot; he said that another step@@ son , who dwell@@ s in near , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we went up and guarded the water and fed in , &quot; &quot; Hans@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , in which she lived there , never had seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck , and they had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated to Friday . &quot;

&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; cut by balls &quot; , survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police divi@@ des that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week is already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grand@@ parents gave that Brown suffered several Sch@@ uss@@ ab@@ uses , including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and belly , but that he was at the hospital for consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has made much more , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; divided his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ende@@ z . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boys was classified in a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared with the broad@@ caster that it is expected to come again .
he would have to begin the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is critical condition ; the other two victims , according to C@@ BS Philadelphia , is in stable condition . &quot;
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found himself in a critical condition , reports the broad@@ caster . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were just determined whether there could be under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators distributed C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it apparently came to a cruise between several archers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ cked to different assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ threw the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it clearly acted by a constant struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the walking distance , they were ro@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have been given several armed fighters here , which were very active , &quot; divided police jun@@ c@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were taken in the area .
&quot; there came to no fort@@ resses and the police currently checks reports , according to the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross ra@@ cket in the arm when she played before her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I am under the women &apos;s Olympic champion in the gy@@ mna@@ stics and this is more than a reason .
&quot; first , I have been doing so dominant since 1984 at every summer Olympics and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three Tur@@ ner@@ ves , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this crew , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Madison Ko@@ cian , who is Kath@@ o@@ lic@@ in , round off , makes every proud . &quot;
this crew finally reflects the US .
it has the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence on the top of this sport art .
&quot; over the last four years , the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ ves an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American woman . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were available .
this shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising view of the Olympics and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as it was unexpected , yet master@@ ful gy@@ ma@@ stic rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won the Gold Award for Women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we don &apos;t see gy@@ mna@@ stic classes throughout the country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison one to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team is only four Tur@@ ner@@ ves in the team . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ns will unite more expensive sport and Turner in the first line in private gy@@ mna@@ stics , which will be maintained by parents , for the training , integration , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these gy@@ ms are in wealthy suburbs that support the business .
&quot; in these verses , Turner receives its entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes , since they started with the gy@@ mna@@ stics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the communities of Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a powerful and light accessible gym . &quot;
I have founded my gy@@ mn@@ asium of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gy@@ mna@@ stics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trains national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September , we are expanding to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth of high quality gy@@ mna@@ stics that earn the opportunity to learn from this great olymp@@ ic sport art . &quot;
&quot; Tur@@ ns develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body and hard work , discipline and destination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and training success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the tur@@ tle and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is an so exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic Team gol@@ ds and thanks , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different background to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assist@@ ants would like to organize further strikes after she refused Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes caused by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who viol@@ ate it in the election . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt found plans to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS , in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , &quot; and every further delay for employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assist@@ ants will receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend work to improve the care of ung@@ od@@ ly times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Commission for assist@@ ants shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assist@@ ants agreed to the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it will be able to treat the current population crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks , who still stay , until the first group of doctors have to fall under the new contract , must be made progress and running time . &quot;

&quot; this was done by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only the last month , that his door would always be obvious . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must act now , lift up the vibration and concerns the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; he should not do this , so the assist@@ ants made it clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a breakdown of nearly 13,000 rout@@ in@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 dates , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included to grant doctors on the string post@@ ulate cover . &quot;
the ministers had hop@@ ed to end the dispute over the changes caused by an assumption of re@@ formed contract with the function@@ ary of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants to be a better week@@ day for the 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants that are subject to the contract .
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of N@@ HS , urged the assist@@ ants to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working action do not reach a little , but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only wor@@ ries , emergency and interru@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the comm@@ it@@ ee of the assist@@ ants , and with the Ministry of Health and other minist@@ ries positively to the concerns about the pre@@ m@@ und@@ ship and the w@@ hist@@ leb@@ low@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; the employers were hoping that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as disp@@ atch , flexibility in training , training courses and gender equality in medicine - such as serious concerns , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

the regulatory Authority N@@ ICE for N@@ HS has been recommended for a four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; about 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of which suffer a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stro@@ kes are caused by collecting fet@@ ched material in the arsen@@ al walls that form the pads .
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag breaks , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through blood flow and blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;

culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on leaving a government report for corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has led to the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim congregations will be ignored as a devastating government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es banned the police , election ob@@ servers and Rath@@ geber to have ignored the evidence of electoral abuse on eth@@ nic@@ ities regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister for integration and local government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption scandal that would be so bad that the police should be allowed to establish military bases outside of elec@@ trol@@ ley to protect the elec@@ trol@@ ess voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead an identification with their identity in order to prove their identity .
&quot; at present , a voters must only call his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , do not remove the ink on the fingers of a person if they leave their electoral agree to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official comm@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this does not only serve as voting rights , but should also protect the municipal government in front of the bro@@ ader corruption and financial backing culture that protect it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be applied to corrupt and illegal intern@@ ships of his am@@ tes . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; based on cy@@ n@@ ical manner and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bi@@ en@@ accus@@ ations .
&quot; Rah@@ man should have directed his campaign on the basis , that it would be the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose it . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either doub@@ tful or the consequence of a im@@ itation , at which one person cho@@ oses another . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud in the whole country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming about frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ election - when the older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose one candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pictured , made several recommendations to su@@ stain the electoral system , including the desire to prove to identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof , pressure on protection require some ethnic minorities was exercised , in particular women and young people to choose in accordance with the will@@ ingness of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese or ban@@ ez background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions have such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; belie@@ vable in terms of eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 Recomm@@ ended supply to clean the system , including the ban that political activists form letters to stop &quot; voting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is drawn from Ther@@ esa May into consideration , also requires harder registration testing to prevent the electoral directory on immigration and social @-@ bet@@ ting purposes . &quot;
&quot; to consider options , elec@@ torate in front of the choice after your ID . &quot;
&quot; not to use the ink on the finger of a person , as soon as she has delivered her voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews on the nationality of a person perform to ensure they are in@@ eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on mot@@ ions on an automatic mail code .
&quot; prohibition , that political activists process full letter and envel@@ opes . &quot;
the police force the constra@@ ints to set off election stations .
&quot; a law change , which facil@@ it@@ ates an indictment due to en@@ forcement of the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Pop@@ ular Law in 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer for@@ b@@ ade in election stations .
requirements that only English can be used in voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensive training of training in order to ensure that the employees will rule the rule alone in the voting cabin .
Sir Eric falls about the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; in addition , the court ruled Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy to corrupt and illegal intern@@ ships as un@@ distur@@ bing . &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty of evidence - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ controls &quot; of the Rath@@ houses of the Rath@@ houses .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heir , but the wor@@ r@@ ying and conce@@ aled spread of electoral fraud and leuk@@ emia of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;

buyers in Pri@@ marks on woman who tried in the middle of business in@@ am@@ eless under@@ wear
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should go , when a woman drew her clothing in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she whis@@ pered , as she looked at it , she moved back and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .

&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; people could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , it took a pair of sau@@ cep@@ tive from the position , moved their own streets and tro@@ users , and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she tried not even to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - it was simply there , fre@@ ch like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she went out the sau@@ cep@@ tive , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , because they put them back to the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ stitution , before they finally decided that you did nothing right to come back and went out . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that someone observed - or think about the person who would buy the underground , which she tried . &quot;

the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; as I have received , the staff tried to draw the clothes from the sale after she went - what is the same thing . &quot;

how to protects against Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before ce@@ ase@@ fire
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him something safer . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to reach armed rob@@ bers on the distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of it , whether you are approaching from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ bers about the sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; when you push back from behind , then you should turn your att@@ ack@@ ers so that you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go out of the sh@@ out line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you beat him with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him then with the knee in the body and turn off , while the att@@ ack@@ ers met before pain , the weapon from his hands . beat him with the run and move backward , while they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; near Ang@@ rei@@ ther , approaching the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the sh@@ out line , take the weapon and rotate it , so that the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , lay the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon from his handle before moving backward and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it &apos;s Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that there is a prey in the saf@@ est thing to submit your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the dirty locations of Europe
a British travel under@@ gone his immune system and worms of a serious examination by taking some of the most poll@@ uted and ec@@ ar@@ rests places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ out his course on a euro notes , a ban@@ ister on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing machine at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a washing machine on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before the clo@@ cks of any object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show itself and show us what he will inter@@ fere . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ ming under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; some surprising results brought to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ing head of a pulling toilet , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely sho@@ cking , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sp@@ ula more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; luck@@ ily , nothing left what he ab@@ le@@ aked , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known for this to test the resistance of his actors by the world , as well as wonderful as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public rail@@ ways to train stations up to the r@@ ots of toilets , the task posed his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the movie he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ worried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and s@@ lu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was just righteous in his call . &quot;
the only one he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ pon@@ y showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , L@@ umin@@ ometric number is freshly washed hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse , after their L@@ umin@@ ometric number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 &quot;
Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This comes the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !
I &apos;ll do nothing here because it is inside .
&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company hosted Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explains the advantages of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that we ended that we said &quot; Let us call us Ian . &quot;
you claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and as it is associated with the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we managed to provide more information on an interesting way .
I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film of the film , added : &quot; let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he had tasted some of the things I need to do , as the ec@@ static Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there was things in which it was easier to bring Ian to put them and others , where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film .
&quot; in one of Vali@@ o survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents , lac@@ tic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said that they are at least occasionally products containing the concerned lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ative Social @-@ apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ ozi@@ al family left her social apartment after a delay of £ 50,000 because she had terrorist their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ bil@@ cock have been thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; once they were for@@ cible from their estate , sho@@ cked employees of the housing estate the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls are cl@@ oned holes , wood floors were excited , rub@@ b@@ ish was lubri@@ cated on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family have been moved and it is assumed that she now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared not to repair the apartment anymore . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot;
there are many things to consider because this estate is probably considered as a beautiful part Corn@@ walls .
the family is not@@ orious and her reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which had meanwhile lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , in@@ timi@@ date of residents , drug abuse , drug traff@@ icking , drug traff@@ icking , drugs , and flu@@ kes included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease contract , received an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under the circumstances , old gar@@ bage was found &quot;
&quot; in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden di@@ ets were excited &quot;
&quot; neighbours said that they were fighting on the road , and regularly had to be called the police . &quot;
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ etes her and her partner these week non@@ violent from the estate after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to draw up voluntarily .
the Del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ated by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that their lives was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They looked at no man . &quot;
we lived 20 years in addition to them and it was bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not stayed here !
&quot; now , where it &apos;s finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the covered side of the municipal house , rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that it was the ten@@ ant to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and their family , as a dol@@ phin is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; that was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their deeds had to be aw@@ ful for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I guess all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have been cour@@ ageous for us and have made us the information provided . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will don@@ ate a few neighbors , and the message is convey@@ ed that ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour is not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that let down in one of the bedroom of the house after the del@@ ights on the ground .
workers of the house management now will have a waste disposal that is surrounded by the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as guards , par@@ ap@@ her@@ es and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine fine after being found guilty of a threat of class B in the trade agreement .
&quot; she claimed that the money was a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came in 2013 with a car accident . &quot;
&quot; once they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner will now live in a private accommodation at Plymouth . &quot;
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that she is ten@@ ant to keep r@@ enters , which will not hold on the house order &quot;
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w , by the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , announced that the Del@@ og@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants that do not comply with the assignment . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can help themselves without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as to those who were damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
the Devon and Corn@@ wall police will never toler@@ ate crimin@@ ality and ant@@ iso@@ es behavi@@ ors who continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
&quot; tourists turns into panic in Portugal , after a ti@@ p@@ tured military jet flies &quot;
&quot; Sonnen@@ an@@ bet@@ s in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life &quot;
a port@@ ug@@ isi@@ esch@@ es P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the aviation forces put an incredible crash flight
&quot; the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but waited for a security risk . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment , in the anxi@@ ous tourists begin to get into panic after a ti@@ mid@@ able jet lag over a full beach . &quot;
&quot; dramatic video recordings showed , such as the military aircraft flew almost in close proximity across the sun@@ beds on the beach stage in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers arise when they were understand@@ ably , wor@@ ries about the noise of the shock @-@ driven works , without first to see what caused by the clouds to them . &quot;
the incident occurred in the afternoon of Costa Nova in the afternoon near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ an@@ des , one of the many holi@@ day@@ makers that posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall . &quot;
N@@ un@@ o arro@@ gan@@ ja added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like that the plane would fall down to me .
&quot; tourists arrived at the beach of Av@@ eiro in panic , when the plane came out of the darkness and flew unbelie@@ v@@ ably deep . &quot;
&quot; today , the Portuguese Air Force showed that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast and so deep , that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the Jet due to the bad visibility conditions were somewhat lower than usual , however , the Air Force showed that safety at any time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed these summer pieces of the Portuguese mainland , where four people came to death on the island of Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today gave us that the pilot had to fly due to the conditions - strong fog and bran@@ ce - so deep , what its visibility were rep@@ ain@@ ted . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight at which the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of exercise
Super@@ cup : bar@@ ca with worry about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
&quot; in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , Catal@@ ans will compete against FC Sev@@ ille , taking three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
the Dou@@ ble@@ winner needs to do with the sub@@ du@@ ed Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reg@@ ained Europe league champion among others on Ne@@ y@@ mar who won the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andre is also missing .
&quot; the Germans suffered a shift in training in training , where@@ with the ser@@ en@@ quiries at Bar@@ ca at least in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen w@@ ett@@ lement in Barcelona has been around the status as number one for two years .
&quot; on this reason , Coach Luis En@@ rique ren@@ ounced a clear decision on a clear decision and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er Ste@@ am in most of the remaining applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness state of the team , which was hum@@ ili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ pri@@ al@@ opp against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co . are not really to convince .
&quot; Sev@@ ille again has the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , making the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is winning the record winner in this application . &quot;
Ma Long in a league for table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympics .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro in a one @-@ page final finals and &quot; title Defense &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.@@ 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the World Ran@@ kings first won the &quot; Golden Grand Slam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier , and Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Jun Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese have done it as expected in the end game and made the title one another .
so it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese to get the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympia @-@ Tre@@ pp@@ chen was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left to the plate alone , between the sets and with time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;
they were withdrawn on the tri@@ bun@@ ny and left their cont@@ actors in the fair competition alone .
&quot; I have played the Mat@@ ches until now , I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , Z@@ hang was fol@@ ly told . &quot;
&quot; based on the game , gold and silver medal winner with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ expect@@ edly .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent just in the first sentence .
afterwards he made the temp@@ o at the plate and left Z@@ hang down there only a total of 13 points .
&quot; due to the su@@ peri@@ ority of Ma , not the expected ri@@ pping match was developed . &quot;
but they were enough to see the stunning ball@@ point of ball@@ ads .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ se was dra@@ gged a ri@@ ffs , after that , &quot; ultimately , &quot; ultimately had to lie with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and J@@ ör@@ gen Per@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) had become a similar table @-@ old Olympia @-@ V@@ ed . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed - massive problems in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Republi@@ can have been pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , also in traditional conservative states their majority . &quot;
&quot; presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump gave now weak@@ nesses of his electoral campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ proof M@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire reported something like concerns about how correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 rival to the race from the race , the doubts grow to his success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he took again his conf@@ essed media . &quot;
Republi@@ can High @-@ bur@@ gers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by the United States of June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes will see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that are common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia apply . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he had to stop at Clin@@ ique : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if hin@@ d : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he does not make anything else to tell us as &quot; the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it was not rich in order for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , that was fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Party of Tr@@ ump should be threatened to submit funds to the support of his electoral campaign , he should not present any better conversion . &quot;
&quot; instead , instead of what would the candidates of Rep@@ ublic@@ ans take stronger than the arms . &quot;
Olympia : tri@@ ster sc@@ am on d@@ oping test
the IOC wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission to the case .
Ken@@ yan athletes are threatened after the second D@@ oping affair in Rio de Janeiro in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after an attempt at a D@@ oping control in the Olympic Village , Kenya sent a coach to home in Kenya . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee took place in order to establish a discipl@@ in@@ arian commission , in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told that the former Sprinter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village an Ur@@ in @-@ Trial under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this is the team leader Ken@@ ias have been reported by D@@ oping controls .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has accepted the IOC for information about the event to commit their own investigations , a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IOC , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was written in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping Control station and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the rehear@@ sal and signed , &quot; stated Ken@@ ias Chef de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athletes who stood on the list for training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in 2015 in Beijing world championship @-@ fourth more than 800 meters .
four days earlier the Ken@@ yan Athletics Women &apos;s Leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
it should be informed against cash payments of his country on the standing d@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has already been under special observation at the IOC in the IOC for a long period of time .
&quot; in the announcement of the IOC &apos;s announcement , more than 2000 d@@ oping target controls in front of the Rio games was noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia will be taken into the visa . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had a lot of pressure on African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ D@@ oping law and a working control system .
the law has been adopted a few weeks before the Olympia @-@ beginning .
&quot; in the episode , the WA@@ DA Kenya took part in the list of countries whose d@@ oping combat is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV report , the ARD will always be raised again , that in Kenya D@@ oping funds will be easily accessible and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; IOC member Richard Po@@ und demanded a similar study in Kenya , as he had asked them in Russian Athletics . &quot;
&quot; in this context , it could be proven that in this sport type of surface and systematic stop . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer .
Salz@@ burger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical in the temple of classical music , filled with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted under the direction of Venezuel@@ an conduc@@ tors Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot; &quot;
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
&quot; in this st@@ aging , Bart@@ oli plays a older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she reminds himself with gro@@ m@@ wood , and her lovers with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
first because they are exceptional !
and then it would be Mari@@ as personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I &quot; Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so , it is wise , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , whom I have as Roman , laugh@@ ing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise for the Opera House : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is so honour for us to work with her .
she is an enormous man .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , that &apos;s very important anyway ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; highly currently : &quot; in this piece it is about pre@@ judi@@ ce and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we have gone the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ zia went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; these are the same subjects , and they are just as strong as it is . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; in London , the IS joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was thought that they were killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ ary of the group in the country , told I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old and died after her family , shortly after she had prepared the country to leave the war and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; you can only hope that the only good thing is in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated to go in a war zone - people who ever stop this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , s@@ ult@@ ana and two other training courses from the east London grew up in a plane direction Turkey and subsequently entered into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
s@@ ult@@ anas family has been informed that she had married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and has been a widow within a few months .
&quot; Rei@@ d says , Clinton will remain in case of a election winner at Gar@@ land as a candidate for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate , Hillary Clinton will nomin@@ ate the judge Mer@@ rick Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; since its nomin@@ ation by Barack Obama , the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been blocked since its nomin@@ ation by Barack Obama in March . &quot;
the majority leader in the Senate Mitch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell is the opinion that the next President will be the successor of the dead judge by the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference , Clinton expected Gar@@ land to select &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot;
&quot; later , a speaker of Rei@@ d said later that he was not talking with Clinton if she would nomin@@ ate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; he praised Gar@@ land , and said , Clinton team would not care for rest@@ less@@ ness with a new candidate . &quot;
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the United States District Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Rep@@ ublic@@ ans block the Gar@@ lands nomin@@ ation , are Lak@@ ai@@ en and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the Presidential Office . &quot;
Tre@@ ats wants N@@ ack@@ t@@ Calendar for &quot; Women and Men
&quot; the Tre@@ ats magazine works with photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere , to recover a 1970s Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot;
but instead of famous naked people they want to find the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
&quot; the editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Shaw told us at the beginning of this year that his N@@ eck magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes , as &quot; Play@@ boy for men be . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that the calendar does also do .
&quot; we must return to the representation of tim@@ eless and classic ni@@ ack@@ ness , where both women and men feel comfortable and feeling themselves from these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; said Shaw in a press release on the publication of the Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women will participate in this project because it is a wonderful artwork .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open Cast@@ ing Call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish church anticip@@ ates mass cur@@ sor
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kurdish Church Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seek@@ ers from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it may even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard procedure of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass cur@@ s@@ ist to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of protection from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime continued the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already crossed the Kurdish High @-@ bur@@ gen in the months ago , 500,000 Kurds are over to escape in Turkey . &quot;
after the missed p@@ utsch still so@@ ils and op@@ aus@@ al ethnic Turks .
many will begin to restart in Europe when they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can &apos;t be that a state who takes refugees to refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; President of Staff compl@@ ained the targeted attraction of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Algeri@@ an towns . &quot;
&quot; thus , Erdo@@ gan will raise the out Kurds on the remaining Kurds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out in the past hundred years , said Top@@ ra@@ k , who also said CDU member . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government demanded that the federal government has positioned themselves as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan , and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there is a &quot; wit@@ ch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
I feel no longer in Germany in recent months for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; for asylum in Germany , more Turks are seeking asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire mark@@ edly destroyed the professional existence as a Gü@@ len tra@@ ilers and other acade@@ m@@ ics .
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the K@@ em@@ alists and se@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un said , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports under calling on numbers of the Federal Ministry of Defence , the Turks had already approved the largest group of asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all had been entitled to be entitled &quot; ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , you cannot find the war against war , poverty or gu@@ e@@ pl@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers are political , i.e. politically , by state of state . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; going to go where it we@@ h@@ eth
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als get nothing from the summer campaign with - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia must not choose the country tag .
they understood them in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern .
&quot; in 2021 , the daily election will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
because so far it does not exist : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ sw@@ inging air combat - that is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als , which are to be convinced of the electoral powers , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the rest that are in the country , on Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not loc@@ als , so do not choose the country tag . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , spread the posters , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , and on the end of the votes cast out , only tired . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must still leave the campaign about the people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , when one can say that , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 is the strongest party , is now clear in the p@@ olls . &quot;
&quot; exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing A@@ D cuts and what is left at the end of Ko@@ al@@ ition@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaign , one sees from his grand@@ parents . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the land , spread ro@@ ses and pl@@ au@@ ts a little with the people , as it was already his legendary , Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise past@@ ing has cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel bl@@ aming the bl@@ oss@@ oms of the Af@@ D .
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We create &quot; &quot; the A@@ scen@@ sion of Rec@@ ei@@ sts , &quot; &quot; which is probably going to cost the beautiful office now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its peak candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if you make a wrong time on the right place election campaign . &quot;
she was invited twice a German Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel German Bundestag is in the Nor@@ theast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad no eman@@ cip@@ her from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CDU does not drop to the usual electoral states on market places and shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and air balloon . &quot;
&quot; this , so Kok@@ ert , plays only one &quot; lower part . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the union also noted that you have to cut off the base the base that she needs to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the times of the country hardly exist . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU @-@ election Kok@@ ert to his fellow @-@ stre@@ ak is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you need to go where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot on the game is , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group included 22 percent behind partners CDU ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election of 2011 , the SPD was still clear with 3@@ 5.6 percent before the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , Small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , will make the leap into the country . &quot;
they make a modern Tu@@ cep@@ an for a modern Tu@@ cep@@ an and put their electoral campaign to the internet .
&quot; online campaign &quot; , &quot; it is called Claudia Mu@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green electoral fighters go to domestic stim@@ ulation according to local stimul@@ ates among the holiday . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ di@@ dat@@ in , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ duc@@ al lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : guest houses suffer from blocking
&quot; in the speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for the persons responsible for the work of construction , starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and at about 20 o &apos;clock , there are all@@ enth@@ al@@ ben praise . &quot;
&quot; these have made everything quite dark , &quot; El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff , from the jet gas station . &quot;
that is a super@@ team .
there is no hiding place .
&quot; at the end of October , the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south , until the end of October is supposed to be completed . &quot;
&quot; be praised , too , will also be responsible for the work of work , for instance , when it comes to the establishment of heating cru@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was emigrated to the south and also the lock of Asp@@ erg@@ strasse was lifted up in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been relaxed . &quot;
citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again on both sides .
the export traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some significant complaints , &quot; says the Head of Economic management of the rehabilitation manager Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bashar al road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schl@@ eich@@ ways were seeking and rather confi@@ ded to their Nav@@ i . &quot;
what led to that man@@ cher truck in residential areas can be fran@@ chise .
&quot; since the speed limits , the church requested the measurement vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were significant adv@@ ances , &quot; says King , who made himself a position about the situation itself . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute lit@@ ters .
the fastest lap was on the speed of 77 hours in the Tempo 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been moved , but it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for the business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small comfort that customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open to the road again . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business@@ men don &apos;t like to look . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 re@@ acts with them has led to sales in sales , everyone who asks you to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; final customers &quot; less to do , so for other companies , the refurb@@ ishment has hardly consequences . &quot;
&quot; in Mai@@ er &apos;s deal@@ ership from Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decline , &quot; but also a fact that of course &quot; the balance is missing . &quot;
&quot; the most poll@@ uted , the local along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil have failed . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro .
the increase in sales fell to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot;
the street lubri@@ cation took his operation &quot; to return two years . &quot;
he had to put away half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees , and half had been dismissed , the policy would have been re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt respon@@ ds to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation otherwise to the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also have the dis@@ advantages to bear in the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other land orbit , where such a little more generous . &quot;
&quot; with all sounds , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; that other regular guests can now look less frequently because of the complicated traffic control , it can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you do not drive , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises of BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on his client for the biggest crisis which has experienced his restaurant in its long history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , that is already brutal . &quot;
constantly in the name of the terror control of laws .
&quot; according to recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a thick security package . &quot;
but what has an Dul@@ ce status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner says to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconciliation .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for his new security . &quot;
they call for anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also involved myself .
&quot; the Minister of Interior , however , was situated on results and on a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , a little time spent a little time before he presented his conclusions to security in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; now , however , the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; some is known already , announced , announced that a new security authority should take care of the rat@@ ory communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; in fact , not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU regulations on flight data and ce@@ ase@@ fire . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities are also not surprising .
&quot; for part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second stop for proposals to date with the SPD : he wants to push sympath@@ y for terrorist groups and dou@@ bling jihadists with double citizenship to the German pass . &quot;
&quot; that will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man in front of the CDU . &quot;
&quot; however , he will hold this anyway for reasonable and demanding nothing , which had no chances in the coalition partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; they are partly in itself : he plans fast procedure for deportation and more possibilities for detention of deportation . &quot;
refugees to be brought to the country in order to check out their smartphones and check social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; at Dul@@ ce for expired asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to put some worse than so far - about such people who commit crimes or their papers to relie@@ ve their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legal .
some even seem un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
and in some points - at the ine@@ quality of Ged@@ ul@@ as for example - the question arises : what does that mean to do with safety and terror ?
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère says it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it is not possible to address that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were killed .
&quot; in addition , many people in view of the high refugee numbers were concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things , who were deeply involved in the people , are unable to equi@@ li@@ fy themselves in election times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the un@@ locking is great .
&quot; and yes , there are voting rights . &quot;
Union and SPD bring itself increasingly in position on internal security .
&quot; in the past few days , between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ ris@@ ky contro@@ versy over the facilities of the Federal Police , then on a security ideas collection of some Unions interior minister in which the Ress@@ ort@@ ch@@ efs also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a down@@ turn of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère moves here to reconc@@ ile sounds too .
&quot; from a turn , he stop nothing . &quot;
we were able to satisfy the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to make new , be not sensible . &quot;
and at a Bur@@ ka prohibition he denied constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ ent on all corners , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; is intended for the co@@ als partner . &quot;
there is a lot inside what might cause dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ filing the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Part@@ en@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only once a lot of conversation and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security , to increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the payout numbers will rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets there is round .
&quot; in the feedback , there is a term for a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s largest highway can continue in spite of the diesel aff@@ aires thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ened primarily in Western Europe and thus loaded the sale of sales , such as the D@@ ax @-@ listed company . &quot;
&quot; the VW brand sold the VW in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales of 14 per cent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , the deliveries decreased by almost one sixth . &quot;
brand leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July above all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , we have given a business situation in some core markets . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote was bur@@ dened by the EU , explained an spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhaust gas is first escal@@ ated , it is also further a min@@ us to Bu@@ che . &quot;
great support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the affected house brand of the Lower Saxony is still ongoing due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a supplier of up from 0,9 percent is to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group CEO Fred Kap@@ pler could continue to refer to an additional sales outlets from January to July . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this time , worldwide 5,@@ 904 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust tests .
&quot; alone in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million cars to conversion into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW confirmed that the reconstruction of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the highway place the customer after re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate &quot; certificate , but talk not of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was called on Friday in the company &apos;s headquarters . &quot;
reason are legal gu@@ ide@@ als .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now to guarantee a guarantee of diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed on Monday VW @-@ representatives in the Federal Ministry of Health .
the Ministry of State was confirmed that there were this meeting .
VW has to satisfy the editions of my investigation commission and KBA .
&quot; devi@@ ations of these are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the Ministry of Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the upgrade no deteri@@ or@@ ations take place and all of the approved relevant vehicles will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in corporate circuits . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; , &quot; Volkswagen will see the opportunity for example half a year after re@@ armament approximately with a engine damage in a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the harm has nothing to do . &quot;
&quot; even in the customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damages caused by any other damages caused by any obligation to safegu@@ arding any warranty conditions as it was called . &quot;
therefore the VW is not using the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund on the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demand inci@@ dents - as a second Institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is only about 139 customers that par@@ don@@ ate 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the Federal Association of German banks speaks of a single incident and sees no signal : normal austerity would not be afraid to pay for their savings penalty .
store money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) you must pay 0.4 per cent criminal prosecution .
&quot; this fee demands Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank G@@ mund , from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100,000 euros on g@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost € 400 in the year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
he has been h@@ itting 40 million euros for a day that could be lifted up by one day and could not be saved .
&quot; those lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank leader . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lie for every million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
he now give the costs after the urs@@ urs@@ or principle .
&quot; the cash simply in the stress of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four convic@@ tions , I don &apos;t want to have the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers have understanding and changes in other investment forms .
only few mig@@ rant to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association Bayern stated : &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme policy course of the ECB causes significant costs . &quot;
&quot; you alone , be &quot; &quot; operational permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ bank Al@@ ten@@ burg land had made headlines in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , the chief leader of the banking sector , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay private customers to be paid for deposits , the competition in Germany is under banks and savings banks much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , &quot; &quot; T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; there is a cliff which is a bit sum@@ p@@ tuous from the property . &quot;
&quot; this can become a small bank for a small bank , &quot; if it &apos;s free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , founded in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ le @-@ E@@ ves , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , founded in 1911 . &quot;
&quot; actors live in the region , actors and entrepren@@ eur . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the cooperative association Bayern , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s Association and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ en@@ Ban@@ ks ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared : &quot; the threshold , into the negative to go towards the private customers , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition was hard , and it dro@@ ves the emig@@ ration of investors to the competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not be fallen in the width .
Dest@@ ination plates : who buys sound plates actually ?
lon@@ ely men who love medium ages .
&quot; before you tell us about the comm@@ ent@@ eil , to over@@ se@@ w him under the p@@ seudonym of non @-@ aging co@@ her@@ es@@ men , this statement runs from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the complex of records of sound plates do not want to welcome a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which is due to be welcomed by the physical objects , but due to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
&quot; those who have bought a record recently , are all predi@@ ction after the age between 45 and 54 . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely K@@ äu@@ fer@@ ous group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables keep their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report in television , I would follow the camera , while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a modest grey suit , before I stand , keep my hands and say something like : &quot; so let us take a look at the sight . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ h@@ os is slowly entering its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices are now fill the buildings where once independent sales are based - there is a hand@@ ful fantastic record specialist . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores , and try to estimate their age and mind . &quot;
&quot; Stuart Ray , 55 , whom I follow by Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men &apos;s middle age , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I &apos;m not followed him home ) , clothed the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : it is now able to buy disks , which he had not been able to buy them , when he had been published , when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late 1960s , early &apos; 70s , which appeared , when I was 11 or 12 . things , with whom I was probably too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it is true that those who want to buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my le@@ aster .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , believes that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about com@@ eback and let themselves go to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have disp@@ osed of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers that once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to a particular age of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phon@@ ica to realize that record shops offers a calm community of equality .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took a violation of the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med from the digital world , and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted sound platforms , from objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
that is with me as collector so I think it is so many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal with .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; fl@@ atter@@ ed a staff of a platform . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record have bought a record , they haven &apos;t heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey was also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record , have no turn@@ tables . &quot;
at that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ acks a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova Com@@ pil@@ ations .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; trop@@ hy &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone was recently released here and said , &quot; I have no turn@@ table , but I would like to buy a radio record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
we have people who say : &quot; I have no turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; these are younger men , not older , who only come to clean . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor , has a b@@ low@@ able audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists , the pictures make , te@@ ens and women aged middle ages . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned stores - Wild Be@@ aches of the latest syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ be@@ pack@@ ers pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ills from the speakers - is it good to see such di@@ vers@@ ities in the customer .
&quot; none of them looks strange indeed , but brand psych@@ otic trau@@ mas are difficult to determine if one stands for about 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variation of the records for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a man@@ ne@@ phe@@ w as a large store .
&quot; they do not deserve much , therefore collecting records no real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to hear music from one computer , or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives with a ver@@ aging sigh@@ s . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers is inspired by : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the certificate that Je@@ ans , I observe a group of young girls who group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras , before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cro@@ sley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classi@@ cs , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above , that it is impossible to summar@@ ize them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for this objects mean more money for the industry , and some customers could give to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most of luxury objects such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research practices revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they do , at least in turn@@ tables in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and record @-@ lovers , which exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ for@@ en exist . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with safety , not with the bo@@ oth@@ s by record shops of the Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through plates , while the rigid view of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old @-@ old present@@ er , who rises nothing about the shoulders of the middle age . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live in the jungle . &quot;
&quot; in case of a trial hearing these week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argu@@ ed that the State should be merged to sell 72 pro@@ vis@@ or@@ ical stores , in which persons sold within the camp goods , from cigarettes to Energ@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser services can sell or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be torn down because they would be paid a parallel economy to be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and the fire and san@@ itation risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups distributed to the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany R@@ aser must be adjusted to the next generation speed sensor : in different states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash units have been tested , the tem@@ pos@@ er of especially effective . &quot;
&quot; the fut@@ ur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement trailer of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance on the accident , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to san@@ itation bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure there with a stationary bl@@ itter for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
&quot; a permanent mobile building , however , can be too dangerous or elabor@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is aut@@ ark : its battery lasts five days , the case data will be encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be carried out simultaneously on several tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits , and access to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor itself . &quot;
&quot; in extremely comfortable condition , one can move the trailer with any car with a trailer cl@@ utch . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easy to cl@@ asp , it is lowered in the measuring operation , so the wheels in the mo@@ wer and by the way also disappear in the safe outer skin cover . &quot;
a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itter in front of V@@ and@@ alism .
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in different states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also bl@@ amed with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain re@@ covering silver in 7 @-@ way ru@@ g@@ by after the Master@@ class gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain during the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening on Thursday night , when they were defeated at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ odoro Stadium . &quot;
&quot; recorded a master class in the handling , side step@@ ping , back , liner run and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic wa@@ ist every colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of silver medal - Great Britain on this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they struck New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ w , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of it , Fiji had a 15 @-@ man team in order to be defeated in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be for GB to be an comfort - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will hang up a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ryan , the former head for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind .
eight years ago she lost her game with Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this sl@@ ack is we@@ aving , but the progress is astonishing . &quot;
&quot; Fiji began to be wonderful , and the attacks were GB@@ S out of fun . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , when one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au moved in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely had the ball .
&quot; a hot T@@ ackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa , a third gate to achieve , but it has only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a found a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the revival and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u preached by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , when Fiji was born to play the 7 , while the UK still had da@@ zzle . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to half time through and ended the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova was going through a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ orton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was already long in favour of the South se@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang and d@@ anced on the tri@@ bun@@ ny . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ rows with another attempt in the last seconds .
the fi@@ ff sm@@ itten that Fi@@ j@@ is re@@ im@@ pover@@ ished and the GB k@@ ic@@ t sm@@ itten in the lawn .
&quot; earlier in the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 defe@@ ats and the Great Britain pressed South Africa in a cris@@ p half @-@ fin@@ s from the race - British conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ w in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ orton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the position in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant delay from Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thereby the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through the fight with the cancer victory
there will be no more effective gold than those games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first ru@@ dder to the last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it were only the children sitting at the Ru@@ ins , there were three voices in the boat . the ech@@ o of the train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ present as she became the second Olympi@@ ad in the branch without tax woman in a row , the first women in the history of the British Sports that laid out such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least her 3@@ 9.@@ ter is un@@ used , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athl@@ ete , which reflects on the surface with the elegance of vibrations , which does not reflect the type of tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the Ruhr , a Bat@@ a@@ illon is to help those who make the difference and it was no more helpful than the trainer that would not survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky what ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had brass cancer , the oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could be at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin the interru@@ ption of a minimum , in case that under such circumstances there is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , therefore it had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing on itself is a challenge , but that makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ firm@@ ity of the victory , their first thoughts on Williams , who had a annoying morning spent some more than anything else and trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning who was a captain at the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wreck . this is perhaps something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much me this means , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I would have had no better person for train@@ ers or better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponent couldn &apos;t help . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not to make something great .
&quot; today we wanted no fireworks today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding in their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now it just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have been too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exempl@@ ary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bavarian widely exempl@@ ary . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water association as an example for the large water producers .
so it was named after some time in the origin@@ alt@@ on in a post of the Bavarian Radio .
a little later the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken gave the two purposes .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group sailed &quot; Bavaria &quot; as exempl@@ ary .
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , which was 31 years in the two @-@ year @-@ association staff , of which 28 years as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with seat in K@@ ott@@ endorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 locations and W@@ eiler with about 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the communities of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brun@@ n , lou@@ der , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of B@@ aun@@ ah . &quot;
there are water supply agreements for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ n &apos;s Mayor of Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was stopped in 1985 as a water level and was appointed Managing Director of the Pur@@ pose Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and varied from the water management and maintenance activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency par@@ agra@@ phs on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an exceptional events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) and compensation of the farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer control ( 1999 ) and the re@@ formation of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the re@@ formation of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; I have not given any lac@@ tation and I have always recorded improvements , because water lives and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her foli@@ age , she praised G@@ öl@@ dler &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used a lot of heart blood for its water @-@ purpose , and he has been living in the water @-@ purpose association , as it would be its own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was present as a real practition@@ er for the success of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group to the nit@@ rate of the District of Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; for this , he has received much recognition and praise . &quot;
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller &apos;s part praised the Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him 28 years with him .
he is the best water level and he was a faithful kn@@ ack .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from its perspective , he called the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the re@@ structure of the Pur@@ pose Association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult use , however , the pipe @-@ break at Kirch@@ lou@@ der was on a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees the whole night , so the villages with water could be supplied . &quot;
&quot; even the supply of Neu@@ brun@@ n , one can only keep up only , because you filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with sl@@ oth@@ s . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose association was taken from a loud voice to Daniel Stür@@ mer who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you have to have courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; the medicine made significant progress , &quot; said the 44 year old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease was detected by her son , they believed they had to die . &quot;
&quot; now the eigh@@ ty @-@ year old Ti@@ ago was a well @-@ going and learn privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man held on Friday at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and they were fatal .
&quot; the man called himself in us and indicated that his life is shot dead , &quot; said a police officer . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators may be on the escape , after him I will be publicly . &quot;
&quot; nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , and has a glass . &quot;
meanwhile the police published a photograph of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a glass .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with themselves , so the police . &quot;
&quot; if Sven S. sees , the 110 is supposed to call . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lübeck wanted to do no information about the T@@ ather@@ gang , or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but confirmed that a person has been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a T@@ öt@@ t@@ deli@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more , &quot; &quot; said the police station in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to the eye , a special purpose unit ( SEK ) was at the site of Tat@@ a . &quot;
steel - lighting for German steel industry
the cra@@ wling and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared by additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which are threatened by the industry , are threatened by the table . &quot;
&quot; the Liberation Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West German general newspaper &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) said in the liberation of renewable energy production in the German steel industry &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we finally reached after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to use the steel manufacturer , which are used gases from the high oven for electricity generation , to the checkout . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry associations , the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ , there is now a basic certificate with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only if the generators be replaced in the steel plants , an EEG re@@ location of 20 percent may be replaced . &quot;
but this also won &apos;t be collected in the steel industry .
IG Metall sal@@ utes the agreement of Germany with the EU Commission to qualify for its own energy production .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful spin of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel , the future &apos; is the first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; also , IG Metall @-@ boss Jörg Hofmann stated in Frankfurt with the reform of the emissions rights . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering under over@@ capacity and a considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation continues to intensi@@ fied as the world &apos;s largest global supplier of China in view of the weaker domestic demand of mass@@ aging steel to the global market . &quot;
European manufacturer t@@ oss Chinese steel corporations price d@@ umping .
&quot; over the spring of this spring , the situation has something relaxed . &quot;
&quot; for example , import tari@@ ffs on imp@@ orter effect , to others have the economic outlook in China . &quot;
it is un@@ clear how sustain@@ ably the price h@@ aul is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
recently the prices have been stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp wanted not to exclu@@ de the works of individual works as well .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel manufacturer remain c@@ auti@@ ous and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , it produced a good six percent lower than in the previous year &apos;s steel , as the economic association was closed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a brief increase in May , the amount returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association anticip@@ ates an increasing order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : sing the Seniors &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the teaching study , she finished the subject of music , and today he sings the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a seniors choir . &quot;
&quot; sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , she does something good in her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is equal to several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most elderly people sing in the choir and share the joy of music , describing H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular interaction , pension@@ ers can connect social contacts and maintain . &quot;
&quot; for often , social and family structures in the age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to learn to others , to learn to others - a choir is a very special form of compositions . &quot;
&quot; in the positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler believes . &quot;
&quot; for they exercise a deep , controlled breathing . &quot;
who regularly calls his lungs are also not so fast in everyday life as fast as the pu@@ rest .
&quot; even if it comes to get the sound of voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Employment Association of the Seniors @-@ organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , explains them . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is often observed that singing or listening of songs in elderly people often w@@ akes up many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te and particularly melo@@ dies , humans themselves de@@ pressed people at a long time . &quot;
&quot; in case of singing , it also demands special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , to focus on their own voice and on a pre@@ defined rhythm - this is a major cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people living alone , do not just pract@@ ise themselves on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , who lear@@ ns through the singing in the choir , writes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ este@@ em is growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I &apos;m long for something , I &apos;ll get better and alert about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks they have little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ning people , who hears a sound like a sound ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors are different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; somebody from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a veter@@ an ench@@ y@@ or , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
&quot; who would like to sing in a church choir , can turn right to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior li@@ que@@ urs can be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you have no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can request help at the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who lust has to sing , should be connected to a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul well and has something good - this applies to every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely than a cr@@ ater on scre@@ ams of the young
bi@@ ologists studied in Hanover where the effect of cat bab@@ ys on adult animals have grown @-@ up animals .
&quot; in their surprise , the male also had no cold - however , they stopped in the difference to the female always . &quot;
female cats may recognize the path@@ ogen of cat &apos;s bab@@ ys on the mi@@ str@@ ust of little ones .
&quot; they react ten per cent faster on foli@@ age of K@@ itt@@ ens who have found themselves in great need , as scientists from the Animal College and Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; however , cr@@ ater react to the rest of K@@ itt@@ ens - but always equal . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ xes of less and strongly er@@ ra@@ ged young for the males either non @-@ perc@@ ep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said Biolog@@ o Wie@@ b@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ed with the pressures of their aid needs . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult cat and eight we@@ eds were observed from the animal keeping of MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; they were played for a rowing of little ones , taken up for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;

the Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
Turkey has been issued an arrest warrant against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football match takes place once again in Turkey . &quot;
prior to the Du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ al between Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
&quot; already in July , the government &apos;s resignation after the resignation attempt in July bet@@ eu@@ ed the government , the everyday life of norm@@ ality should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected to do the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
this is not just done before the football .
the Pro@@ secution filed an arrest warrant against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ cht@@ r .
&quot; in the meantime , he is accused of being accused of being a member of a terrorist group in America . &quot;
&quot; the Sü@@ cht@@ r is supposed to be the followers of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the initial status applies to 90 days of exceptional circumstances until October , in fact , that in fact , the lives of most Turks had as good as no effects . &quot;
the no@@ c@@ tur@@ nal &quot; democracy guards &quot; on public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as are traditionally not among the friends of the President . &quot;
&quot; but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks , but with the dramatic experience in history , is the strict de@@ jection of military slides . &quot;
there &apos;s even the fans even - no matter whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as .
at Pok@@ al@@ winning &quot; Gala &quot; it will come back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski again .
&quot; his sporty value , the Kölner in the past season , presented with 17 gates , and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first play as Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
&quot; in the final game against Fen@@ her@@ ah@@ ce , he achieved the 1 : 0 victory . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; fan@@ atics &quot; celebrated it : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appointing season for the record master was a promising completion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ off @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; was made up early in the Europe League . &quot;
&quot; in the South of Li@@ g , it lasted only six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who set the base for the 14th title in 26 season , thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , which was the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; at the AC of Florence , the AC Florence under the Treaty and Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as announced only to return to Bes@@ ik@@ t@@ as , because of the political situation in the country after his European holidays . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; K@@ icker &quot; club chief F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storms would have to be ready to aband@@ on around a third of its € 7.5 million estimated annual financial year , it is clear : &quot; his salary in Florence can &apos;t pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in the Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin had been closed twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others over@@ led Athletics sinners can only laugh at about - they fight in Rio around medals .
the topic D@@ oping is intended for the headlines around the Rio Olympics in Rio .
&quot; the rus@@ sian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had their starting law shortly before the games , was blo@@ wn out with her start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
&quot; there was a quir@@ ky scene : with a set smile , she was still proud in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; as fixed , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a j@@ ub@@ el@@ tower . &quot;
but there are many more sport@@ s@@ men who continue to start at the start of the Rio Olympics in Rio .
here is a glance :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed for two times for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its foundation in 2004 , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ champion even runs faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the biggest ch@@ allen@@ ger of Us@@ ers Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 m @-@ Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the taking of pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery , she had a strong tooth pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended himself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship was tested positive for the forbidden stim@@ ulation agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin . &quot;
Per@@ kovic fought in@@ comprehen@@ sible intake and was locked six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters in this year go to the account of the great gold fav@@ ours .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two times champion over 400 m , was tested positive and 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
a means to increase penis enlargement was responsible .
this year the 30 year old has over 200 and 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : hardly any athl@@ ete was recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with him testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ D@@ op@@ ings in 2004 because of ster@@ oid D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the 2008 Olympic Games recognized him back due to a judgement of the International Sports Court of Justice CA@@ S . &quot;
with 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he is ranked two of the World Ran@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world records and gold fav@@ ored was only positive in May , but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , critics have found evidence on taking a forbidden food rating , the lock of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA was mild and ran already on July 13 . &quot;
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas S@@ öll , Friday . &quot;
&quot; they suffered from cutting and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it again . &quot;
she planned her hom@@ ebo@@ und in early September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on also are Austrian citizens . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in contact with local authorities , such as s@@ ap@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; located about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in an exit quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Tha@@ il@@ change was killed and approximately 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three low@@ lands and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up , and another person was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
Ph@@ uk@@ et was also reported in the morning a bomb explo@@ ded .
the Det@@ onation in the vicinity of the most popular bath@@ ro@@ ds Pat@@ ong was injured after police information a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani to the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb which killed a municipal staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flor@@ ist , explo@@ ding in front of the territory had gone into the air in front of the territory . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations requested in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the South@@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ ph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , he named it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; &quot; said General Dan@@ ai crit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning prior to journalists . &quot;
&quot; we expect it , that it is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; it was too early to express itself to possible moti@@ ves , probably the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern , which is typical for the bombing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , however , stated that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamic State Movement or the International Terror@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sabot@@ age that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said spokesperson in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one think that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; during the past few days , the authorities have received secret references to im@@ min@@ ating attacks in the south of the country - however , they have not been informed about the exact date and the places were informed . &quot;
&quot; yet , it is un@@ clear that group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police rejected their officials throughout the country , to strengthen safety around important government buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not judge for tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace , which was used over the years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; following the reason of reason of bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on his homepage , to make statements of the Thai security authorities necessarily . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( safety level 3 ) sailed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ bration and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; following the disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , not necessary journeys are rounded off in these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) sailed for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this dream of the military also in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ CH@@ A said that bombs be an attempt to sti@@ ve chaos , while the country is moving towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody accidents , keeps itself cour@@ ageous to have the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , in the extreme south of the country , the military has not managed to get a grip in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed . &quot;
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok at an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is present in the vision@@ aries of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; after several regional offices , the Constitutional Court over@@ turned the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; for aspir@@ ations against the freedom of democratic principle , &quot; said constitutional protection Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , migrants are diff@@ am@@ ated in the Middle East , or from the Middle East . &quot;
therefore we watch the movement too .
&quot; the &quot; Ident@@ ity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; multi @-@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of their own identity by over@@ taking . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional complaints in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; Ident@@ ity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely matched to the country &apos;s decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the other Islam@@ ists as well as right wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an independent advertising for your own thing .
propaganda is supposed to talk emotional people .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in particular ways .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last of all , there had been reports of several German states over contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; of Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ ate said , he did not have insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts are relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - through certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
so it is crucial to whether such persons have controlled influence on the party .
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; with a look at the significant increase of rectangular off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have found it in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be quite obvious that other right @-@ party groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps or attack from other rectangular moti@@ fs . &quot;
a country @-@ wide or European control of legal terrorism is not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were originated at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; worried about that , in fact , Ma@@ ate concerned about that many convic@@ ts went to the account of people who didn &apos;t come in the right scene before . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ susp@@ ect attacks on asylum seek@@ ers are not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences which had previously voted with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , which were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CDU , SPD or left , however , have radic@@ alized themselves through the right @-@ wing mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used to Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympics will not always determine the headlines around the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave performance by RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am , the easily over@@ turned s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te subsequently became the vir@@ al Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; however , it was rather not his very sporty figure that drew attention to the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates at the Olympic Games ?
the C@@ ush got a special start from the international swimming pool .
this will be distributed to make swimming in under@@ gone countries .
&quot; since the s@@ men run most sport@@ s@@ men , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te makes ready for the great race .
quickly the first nick@@ name took the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; in re@@ jection to a &quot; welfare , &quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made it funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , no role played . &quot;
compar@@ is@@ ons with &quot; Eric the E@@ EL &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i offered the course of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable , the performance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of free style alone . &quot;
Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned just eight months before the Olympia and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping election situation not so tight
the Republi@@ can Presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks on a campaign events in Florida .
&quot; should it be with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already an alternative vide@@ og@@ e . &quot;
he then goes into the holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential elections in November , would be a relatively no matter : &quot; &quot; ultimately it will be either f@@ lap , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of Republi@@ can in an phone interview with the US TV sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it was not rich in order for him at the end of the political correc@@ t@@ ness , that is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; thus , he called the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more resistance ever formed . &quot;

&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said at the end of July . &quot;

Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of re@@ structure are not yet to be seen after 5 years , it was called . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business , each participant will be un@@ quiet sometime . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case for BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts so called , &quot; it was . &quot;
&quot; according to the provisions in the preceding quarter of 2016 , the company had not able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;

&quot; in the first half @-@ year shr@@ inking sales of 72@@ 1.2 million euros , increased by 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter , primarily the growth of the company has been bur@@ dened by its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; in the Consumer Experience division , the company &apos;s business evalu@@ ations of 139 million euros made a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K earned a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
crash@@ es of accidents in cr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight injured
&quot; during an accident of a trip with 43 seniors , when passengers are injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to cut off their data according to an opposite L@@ aster . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a speaker of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation of the bus , the people could not leave the bus , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency service came to the accident on the state road 2 .
the un@@ last travelers were brought back by a liner bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ble district of Pe@@ ws@@ um .
there they should wait for a spare bus of travel business .
investig@@ ators demanded the load drivers and potential witnesses to report in the police .
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees for the se@@ wer@@ age of Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 Euro ; for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro . &quot;
&quot; at the A@@ zo@@ endorf plant , the se@@ wage fee will then increase once again if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; according to a relevant calculation , the se@@ wer@@ age price in Az@@ endorf are at 4,@@ 37 euros per cubic metres . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , he was diagnosed with the approval of the budget of the budget and Kul@@ mb@@ ach that for this se@@ wer@@ age of water . &quot;
&quot; due to the legal basis , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate their facilities . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industry and industrial gear units from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg must attack deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the yield increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative director Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a new provision of fees for the se@@ wage plant in the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and sub@@ missions from the previous calendar period will be the same . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt thus founded the gra@@ fts against each other se@@ wer@@ age , so it is relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , which is between 6@@ 800 and 12000 cubic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; due to its low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would work . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wer@@ age in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the rec@@ eding calendar period of all three systems , not least due to their age of san@@ itation and repair applications in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for pupp@@ ets , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wer@@ age of Az@@ endorf , the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl had to over@@ hau@@ led almost 20 years old convey@@ ing plants , after almost 20 years of operation , the first sep@@ tic pond had to be completed after almost 20 years of operation , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge has to be installed and an additional ventilation can be installed in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expend@@ itu@@ res came to take into account for these extraordinary expenditure and maintenance costs which are considered to be considered in the new calendar period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly lower at the current calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made clear that at low se@@ wer@@ age in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance .
&quot; it was , complem@@ entary Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs have remained in the se@@ wage plant in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned plants will remain pre@@ dict@@ able after the view of stone houses in Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al , especially since the supply of the se@@ wer@@ age of Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ acht@@ al could not be expanded , because it is about de@@ fied facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria exp@@ ire for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were posted .
&quot; the annual average salary of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after the CP@@ I -@@ 0,8 % . &quot;
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
&quot; the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) amounted to -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 amounted to -@@ 0.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as in advance at alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Effect as Asian cartoon crit@@ ici@@ zed
&quot; snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel to breeds . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , there enables Snap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with ident@@ ities in such a way that already borders the sur@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ intri@@ gu@@ ed , independent tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ ections per day . &quot;
all failure to get to the public .
&quot; snap@@ chat filters have been drawn up in the past , in which they were accused that the app will prop@@ agate Black@@ face @-@ shaped or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; as this week some users proposed a filter , which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ting , false teeth , and un@@ opened che@@ eks , called it some critics become a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; yel@@ lowed light . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether these repeated contro@@ versy sur@@ passed on a larger problem , that the company has di@@ vers@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; the news and the indig@@ nation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have been disabled . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but outside , the rac@@ ism experienced , remin@@ ded the filter to viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others have decided the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose twe@@ et were widespread over the photos that the filter was hurt and practic@@ ed un@@ pleasant . &quot;
&quot; she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the opposite position of a very rebelli@@ ous Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects . &quot;
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ly @-@ secured , but that the yellow light was pulled into the most valuable extreme . &quot;
snap@@ chat is not the only company that these cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ is crossed .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless seal and integration struggle , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in the hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who di@@ vers@@ ed in the race as their older opponent , could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats felt a picture , it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu decided to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account to er@@ ase her Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an article for medium and in a phone interview , she said that she may believe that his @-@ related contro@@ versy might reflect a lack of di@@ vers@@ ities in snap@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the large part white , only male leadership and finished her attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in its workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people working there , but not in positions in which they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat is mostly un@@ answered . &quot;
the company has no numbers on seal of its workforce and points to its status as private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there refused Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company has recently agreed a personnel responsible that focuses on under@@ taking population groups and on internal integration groups . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that she is closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership , ISIS intelligence information , introduces Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; according to the United States Central Command , the United States Central Command has changed detailed information to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , in a report by the Congress of Congress in a Report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Members of Armed Forces , Secret Services Committee and the Wehr@@ bud@@ get@@ ites , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , reported how pre@@ set their ass@@ ess@@ ments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida that controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news service information , which were typically embroi@@ dered by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com for terrorism as the actual states before terrorism , and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , &quot; a newspaper article published the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers are suffering , if bad analyses will be presented by our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the Cent@@ Com leader in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indications that government tips are given under Obama instructions , it shows how analysts themselves saw pressure from their suburbs , a optimi@@ stic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , comments and statements made before the Congress clearly positive as it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com was publicly announced that a military reg@@ ression of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is much clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Kansas , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the sp@@ ik@@ es of Central Command has changed its subsequent reports to record the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after being played that analysts concerned concerns about the mani@@ pulation of reports to Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday , the report will be completed by more detailed knowledge during the investigations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the general practition@@ er of the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , they published their own findings on Thursday who agreed with some of the Republi@@ can Task Force in some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , the Cent@@ Com created a revised limited trial for the preparation of subsequent acquis@@ itions to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; the highest level democr@@ at in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; def@@ endant the mor@@ als under analysts and &quot; gave excessive space for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats gave no references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts on a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the Congress &apos;s investigations were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s General inspec@@ torate based following complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press release of the Pentagon , published in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tions would still be in progress . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave us that &quot; experts sometimes have di@@ vers@@ ed opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence will welcome a controversial discussion of this important issues of the national defence . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the investigations on the question of a successful air campaign under the American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of the last year , however , stated the question that President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessment of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information concerning the Islamic State remin@@ ders of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker , a letter of many analysts just looked at the recommendations of many analysts at the time of many analysts at the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ kers according to the government report states that the statements of the government had received no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these pro@@ vis@@ as refin@@ eries had been commissioned to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this knowledge was not published , however , reported the Times in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the Legisl@@ ative assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin retired in April and was replaced in Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US win four @-@ fourth match in the field @-@ hockey field of women , a show@@ down with great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after she shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Feld@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in mind .
&quot; however , they know : the Americans are located at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition , and they are in their group with the British in their first place that remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will hit the first round on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ final , the game will decide which the two teams will achieve the first and second place within their group . &quot;
&quot; the first placed , the strong Dutch will go somewhat longer out of the way that lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after the last London Games were landing at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player in the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 when they could not qualify for the Ka@@ das .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , where she and her team went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , a Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work in London that we now have .
we have the ru@@ dder to pull out completely .
&quot; on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a retreat from the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the play of 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am the game in her hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and lu@@ te the ball in the gate to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had to reserve a goal in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s outcome . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are too late , the Olympic Games are too late . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro events will feel durable and un@@ balanced , a shaving relay for competition and stre@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning rod , which will protect the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes for the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn off the TV , or listen to a paper or listen to your neighbours in the waiting room in the waiting room , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ f@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lot of women with dimples , could definitely be sent to the Prime Time , built by sponsors and charity TV advertising , when he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even F@@ real . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fighting for the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines around gold . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not lit any event .
&quot; the sports , partly in the shade are the sports that are not univers@@ ally acknowledged : air pist@@ ol , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may reign for long .
&quot; but if I &apos;m modest , making arguments for my particular favor@@ ites , then let me draw attention to the discre@@ et charm of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so annoying that many people who had questioned did not know that it is at all the Olympic port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the US athletes sent to competition , it has never gained a medal in the trampoline jumping and made a athl@@ ete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans to share the women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal in London this year .
&quot; the trampoline jumping has a certain outer fish species , partly because it sounds for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ secondary school which sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I &apos;m not an expert but only a second enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never to end up - but also the gra@@ zie of the gym and dew , the two sports that combines it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , meaning as much as &quot; jumping board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; jumping winner jumping on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , H@@ real and Sal@@ tos ) before going on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic Games , you will be evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio each other . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts need to continue to gold further , faster , upwards and dr@@ above , sometimes up to the target , sometimes go and back , to top and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but in television broadcast another heights : the world or the Olympic champion . &quot;
&quot; the targeted streams is no@@ bel , ad@@ orable , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a viewer to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I am looking for watching this games as something tired .
&quot; of this , trampoline offers a breathing . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the Tramp@@ oline jum@@ per is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ all@@ t , seem@@ ingly he@@ el@@ os like an ast@@ ron@@ aut , goes up , then down to the top . &quot;
&quot; there is a contest too , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hot attack on the destination , no wolves in the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant lifts of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen such as the competition for the Olympic Games can be only .
&quot; the Quali@@ fication and En@@ dr@@ yers of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will run the end @-@ out as a part of a afternoon block at two days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ mania they promise a quiet , nice moment , one who probably over@@ looked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be reached by the Ang@@ ers and the objective of male athletes - as it recently proposed the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal recently , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his to air rin@@ ding , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation protest@@ ing &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , ally a ally @-@ ally @-@ ally &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators demand political changes in Ethiopia , fighting for violent resistance of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that the protest@@ ers were killed during cl@@ ashes with the police in sh@@ uss@@ ing .
is Ethiopia just dealing with ?
&quot; over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally @-@ growing economy with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and widespread in more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people on roads and requested fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s answer was un@@ merciful according to human rights organisations .
witnesses reported that polic@@ emen killed un@@ armed protest@@ ers and killed .
&quot; in circulation , videos about protests , probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security men suggest young people with bum@@ ps while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a temporary investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and going to become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians , in order to combat terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expands in considerable pace .
his infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ able train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia everything was other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , whereby dis@@ sidents have been put into silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or transferred to prison , or put into the wilderness of the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except for protest@@ ing , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; Sey@@ ou@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation protest@@ ing .
there are numerous complaints to cover everything from the land of soil to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after an extensive elections last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the st@@ resses along the border to Erit@@ rea ; a battle for this z@@ ack@@ y , controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front , or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced in recent years , could benefit the turbul@@ ences and could be armed . &quot;
&quot; several factors explain why feelings of the delay after years ago , H@@ ink@@ u@@ ck@@ ns are now explo@@ de under the surface . &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were always more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does in regular intervals , do many people still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies to hide , where they can stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they were gathered to protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since Equ@@ ations prosp@@ ered the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Equ@@ th@@ op@@ ia , mainly Christian floods , in the politics and economy , while they are exploited to the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are going to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , in trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel guide , was up to his death in a non@@ sense disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
&quot; analysts say that he was particularly in it , early signs of dis@@ satisfaction , and Special Representative to work and make them un@@ harmful . &quot;
&quot; the current regime is missing in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who arrived from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am coming from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he enjoys the trust of the security services provided by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing , according to the analysis of analysis , and then stolen from the government . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ icia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ suit , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in poverty . &quot;
but obviously this does not respect Inten@@ si@@ fication of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protests in Gon@@ dar , a am@@ har@@ ic city , managed by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is always more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that protests in the United States and other Western allies have a unique position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though she was recently agreed that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; during the west , democracy wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to unite his ally in a vol@@ at@@ il@@ ous area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; is a very thin hike . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump declares his claim in ISIS was &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last contro@@ versy to scatter his campaign by taking his own claim , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication , new questions about the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to be clear and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his fellow workers , who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain that he could not have meant to be meant . &quot;
&quot; after he had made an appeal on Wednesday evening on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made his claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was contrary to the previous day , Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation entirely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to cause something to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ded him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the Republi@@ can presidential candidate . &quot;
the last storm of cr@@ iti@@ que on Mr. Tr@@ ump down while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling circulation to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton thought about economic situation in Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject . &quot;
he warned about Twitter that Mrs. Clin@@ ique would lead to higher taxes and have found her speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already put sar@@ cas@@ m in his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he moved to strong criticism when he meant to cut the Russians Mrs. Clin@@ t Ema@@ ils , but later he declared &quot; Natur@@ ally I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the lingu@@ istic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test like certain messages from his fans , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think too , he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of sharp@@ ening the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has adopted a corro@@ sive sound , since its circum@@ ference has declined . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , published on Friday , showed a tour with great advantage in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally tried to exc@@ use himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he acc@@ uses his critics to mis@@ use his testimony , or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthened in the focus of attention in the last months of its presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze have brought into the un@@ comfortable situation to him , regardless of how prov@@ ok@@ ant may also be his statements . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most famous advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments &quot; &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements , Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ bone , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am Republi@@ can attempt to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton served as an external Minister , ISIS was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; in front of the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump set his attacks on the media , and threw them back on each of his words , and to be vo@@ iced against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the &quot; poor , &quot; old &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked on Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps exc@@ use as only one further evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the Presidential Office .
&quot; once more on the price of the market , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a solid café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s business in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
native people as last loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ aster wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and leaving a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepted credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafés , the owner and managing director of the new cafés . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; he offered a customer to provide money for a new office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are yar@@ ns like cap@@ ers and s@@ auti@@ ous onions . &quot;
there is natural white bowls .
&quot; the café serves no beer , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed an old river . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also disp@@ ers@@ ed by the Willi@@ am@@ sburg Pri@@ zes , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently at a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being pulled to Green@@ point , it would take the way to yourself . &quot;
&quot; after the b had closed , she gave a while the coffee pot on her , she said . &quot;
&quot; I was clear that it was on coffee and on the culture in the ver@@ b which was pleased to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee , even though they were sitting at this day instead of their usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ees a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and ordered inev@@ it@@ ably always D@@ ass@@ le . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes it changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he has no gro@@ wl about it that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie is actually used to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with cold bre@@ wed coffee of coffee . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into Polish , and Rodri@@ guez said that he has prepared to make them soon , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold coffee and sell coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands on a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new Ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was regular , and said that he was destroyed in the ground , when the café was closed . &quot;
&quot; the new café opened , Wh@@ itt did that the bed of Lok@@ i and the Order felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch at O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a fine alarm clock , President Roosevelt said a Fai@@ ble for refined delic@@ at@@ essen of Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wass@@ ersch@@ il@@ tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was something modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historian .
co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was about the Chinese cuisine in the US while Z@@ iegel@@ man tells about life in a house at the Lower East Side at the Lower East Side .
&quot; their newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s sandwich shop for dinner , a small , car@@ ving icon in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered an cream cheese with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable dishes . &quot;
&quot; when the reporter dies in Hack@@ ney , this took place the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were peanuts , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient , and a little cheap , which flows the ingredient . &quot;
imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner .
CO@@ E sm@@ iled .
&quot; it must have laid down in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , a All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women co@@ ves for male Fel@@ low , and it was freshly baked past@@ el served for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans that sent to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; shows the ways to deal with which the country went , not to be the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; it was a time , in the food for the Americans a central , mir@@ ro@@ wed theme was &quot; &quot; buried Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ di@@ ets : mysterious meals such as bre@@ ads and we@@ ather@@ ollen were to be stap@@ le as &quot; wonderful way , eating resi@@ du@@ es , &quot; because Kö@@ che could hide un@@ appe@@ ti@@ able ingredients under a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , that was the center of American kitchen for years , became a rare ser@@ fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; unique mix@@ tures were tried , as a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction came forward to taste or even healthy kitchen . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a court from this ep@@ och , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; there was no more popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions not fit each other .
it was typical for many of the household concepts .
&quot; as never before or since then , domestic economics - including Louise Stanley , Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 . &quot;
&quot; by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encourage women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ol@@ iti@@ ves &quot; and the challenge to transform P@@ amp@@ e as creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historical treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he praised the simple Io@@ wa peas@@ ant house in his kitchen , he sho@@ res like the million@@ th man from the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucum@@ ber sauce , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gilded cooking room and wore a smoke .
he was great more realistic .
&quot; President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to out@@ fit him with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by woman Roosevelt said that the White House brought the bo@@ di@@ lig@@ est food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial food . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , with food , was rejected , once the land came again into the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man , as well as for science on food . &quot;
the couple gave me better to understand the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans @-@ in @-@ law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people sick . &quot;
there was the wind blo@@ om .
&quot; after the plates were cleared out of Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they moved and cover a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ ght , the President Roosevelt at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot;
&quot; there was no added sour cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
everyone di@@ ved something to resist a spoon into the fenced , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E won three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
&quot; at bombs attack , he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo . &quot;
he made his own life on the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar dedicated his life to people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 year old has died at a Fass@@ bomb attack on the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that nearly 60,000 people have saved the lives according to the image newspaper . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers will set their own life on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the area of war .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Society that shows him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an infant from the ruins of a house went around the world .
it made the Syrians to the bright symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; however , as heroes he never saw himself , said in the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; if I die , save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar itself fell victim to a victim , he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Hel@@ icop@@ ter have cast four façade bombs over the Alz@@ adia district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the gi@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that no children play with it , &quot; &quot; quotes his last words before he died . &quot;
terrorists will meet the deadly bomb of the Assad regime .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is nearly 400 years old
more rarely sight .
Greenland will usually come to the surface in winter .
this ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the S@@ anna research vessel .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland won only 150 years old .
&quot; the Greenland floating in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is on average 1,@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes on , it acceler@@ ates the five metre long animal to a sat@@ te 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this long @-@ lon@@ el@@ iness lifestyle seems to be a firm for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ advent@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock these lif@@ esp@@ an , which means for verteb@@ rates a world record . &quot;
the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist thought that Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie become a stone @-@ old .
just missing the evidence .
&quot; Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice sea front of the thin @-@ populated coastal coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear in the surface only in the winter . &quot;
researchers have a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland .
&quot; their time @-@ pent@@ emp@@ t lim@@ bs them , when they had six animals on a station before S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; lo@@ ot make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of a animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had sho@@ cked the pine bone of a young ice cream . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice@@ berg and seek Kad@@ aver , which tor@@ ch from higher water layers down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Green@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a catch from the depths of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 502 cm measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the carbon @-@ 14 method of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye @-@ lens arises already before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which contained proteins later is no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the overall length of 220 centi@@ meters , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 out of nuclear weapons , it is likely to be celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all major Greenland had the normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 cm long Greenland was a age of 335 years , while the record shar@@ k was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring if they are longer than four meters .
&quot; now , researchers were able to arrange the length of the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age of 156 years , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie , with the multip@@ lication of at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
the world record is likely to be present for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is not a coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Grön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bacon was put a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , the body of living animals are often living on austerity . &quot;
&quot; so , they tyres later - and al@@ oud slower . &quot;
&quot; to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
&quot; therefore , the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant . &quot;
another advantage : they have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives in dangerous animals and should focus on it as early as possible , as early as possible as many descendants , &quot; says the Evol@@ ution@@ s@@ bi@@ ologist Sch@@ advent@@ lein . &quot;
a very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life .
building plot in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the community is concerned in the recent meeting of the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel signed by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven homes can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the ground @-@ piece , par@@ l@@ elling and detection issues , the sale of the plots in the residential area &quot; street road &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau young families and mar@@ riages are equally appe@@ aled .
&quot; as it was named , building permission from immediately in the City Hall , will announce the announcement of the plots in its September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to re@@ prove further commercial companies , associated with the creation of work@@ places , the community decided to change the municipal plan in part areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of under@@ time , the commercial area is expanded by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main , in the competition with Paris , Dublin , and Luxembourg , has the best chance to attract jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Compet@@ ence System Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses will continue to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions in the entire EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval of the UK has so far enough . &quot;
this just take advantage of US banks .
&quot; banks have already announced several banks , jobs . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the headquarters of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks of the euro@@ zone , as well as further important authorities as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have their headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the base bank is important for banks , as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ Countries . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg there is a large fund business , but also like Dublin at the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the great airport , Frankfurt am clearly easier to reach . &quot;
the city also points to the city with easily available commercial real estate .
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ Countries . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the Mi@@ riam for top @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the town on No.@@ 19 , Luxembourg on No.@@ 19 and Paris on No.@@ 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if the quality of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European inland market , Frankfurt could put further banks and investors , as the I@@ W ref@@ uses . &quot;
but London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit vote .
&quot; in addition to the figures of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , at the end of 2015 , some 14@@ 4,000 people were working in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. National Judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc are entitled to re@@ funds the refund of the legal cost you have evolved from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was liberated from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the injury of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ drug Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni of Gilead , including an US judge a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the law@@ suit filed on Thursday , U.S. National Inspec@@ tor Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead are entitled to adoption of the costs which were created during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to move with Gilead to cure the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck ass@@ esses each other def@@ endants and ownership of laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vi@@ r , the active ingredients in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the US , troops supported troops that they returned to complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; from the US , troops supported the complete control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have abandoned this , said a speaker of the group on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the still remaining group of fighters that have dug within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they were liberated over 2,000 civilians who were held by the fighters as host@@ ages , Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the D@@ KS banned Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reuters . &quot;

Clin@@ ique earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal state
&quot; Hillary Clinton released their tax returns for 2015 on Friday , this resulted for the presidential candidate di@@ dat@@ in the democr@@ at and their husband a income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton donated USD 1 million for charity purposes , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ ors ; the former Minister of State gave a income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ique candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax returns the last ten years . &quot;
it paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continued to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; admitted by Clin@@ ag@@ nen@@ hel@@ pers in Jennifer Pal@@ mo@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump conce@@ aled behind false pron@@ unci@@ ation and returns to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is usual for US presidential candidates , while they are not obliged to publish their tax expl@@ aining , although they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have a reason for his ref@@ us@@ al examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , regarding the publication of the presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor to CNN , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax checks are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critic , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the Year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al issues related to assets , his business partners , and various other compounds , in particular with Russia . &quot;
Clinton already over@@ threw himself on the subject and on Friday a video published on the Internet in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump stri@@ ve to publish his tax returns .

he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; in the 1990s , POL@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid for two years or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist of the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyer and tax advis@@ ers , the figures that still could be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation that is named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett that people would pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .

&quot; Jewish director crushed Berlin Hotel , because Israeli di@@ aling code was removed after &quot; Arabic &quot; - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ accompanied a media clock after he betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has no Israeli pre @-@ election , since it had requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Shoah &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the list of the hotels . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany &apos;s capital , is possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to select Israel on their own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel concepts . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel announced that the measure was a &quot; clear decision of the management of Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason that stood behind it , dissolved more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung reports . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied by this event and seas@@ oned .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is in Germany in the exactly this hotel chain is even a larger dis@@ grace .
no explanation has no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large response in the Internet , where people named the whole scandal . &quot;
some sub@@ set the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have been given to the con@@ genital view of Arab guests .
&quot; ashamed of you , called it in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly proved all the accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ use himself &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports The Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct instruction , &quot; &quot; Israel is not included in the Express list &quot; , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police reli@@ es Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against protest@@ ing Brazilian students
students beat together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of government for the public education system .
the police attacked Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de against the protest@@ ers .
&quot; the difficulties began , when police officers tried to rub the students , which led to the police Rub@@ mig@@ ra@@ de and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as police . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their stocks over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the governor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw Gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel T@@ emer on walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred some days after demonstr@@ ators went on roads across the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ded President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , led by a vote of the Senate on its con@@ vocation from the office . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to Russian Ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trading rate between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted up against Iran , the interest of Russian companies grew heavily on shops in the country , divided the ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies take existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trading company is one of the largest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the trade rate between Russia and Iran during the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; trade show was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign agency granted around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel route Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries that affects tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record number of Irish tourists could be broken off in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; under the presence of a sh@@ uss@@ ed weapon , three dark @-@ covered persons called their faces , had left their faces from the staff of the beverage market at first , and then probably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police shares not . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from opposite to the parking place in the gravel parking place with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( sleeping ring ) . &quot;

&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social educational group / social group work of the child protection of the Nag@@ old with their counsel@@ ors on their summer vac@@ ancy in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Mühl@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet , Frei@@ zei@@ thei@@ m Hard@@ tw@@ inkl@@ es was the li@@ fel@@ ine group during the first school week . &quot;
several full day trips were on the program .
&quot; for one , it went to Britt@@ ten with the visit of the string . &quot;
&quot; for others to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group met at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and planning . &quot;
&quot; culinary , children and car@@ eg@@ i@@ als were spo@@ iled with their self @-@ prepared body@@ dishes such as aci@@ dic chips , the Se@@ eb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er Blo@@ ff , the English Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ nese . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the gate of mercy
the ministers from the seaf@@ ar@@ ist unit Ey@@ eigh@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were handled . &quot;
&quot; in order to over@@ ride the time until next Rom@@ ano of all ministers in the past two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ erial round St. Anna decided to prepare and implementation of a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations was checked , and we finally decided to the Bishop of Freiburg , where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year &apos;s mercy on the occasion of the Holy Year &apos;s mercy on the Frei@@ burger Münster was a special pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; 16 min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ zimmern made herself on the way . &quot;
&quot; on the evening , he sent Stor@@ ost the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims and divided the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , it was driven by train at the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman is standing and so the pilgrimage was driven from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were moved in the morning and in the evening , depending on a short impulse of different prayer , songs and font . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is on Feld@@ cru@@ zen , chap@@ els or churches are always r@@ ast to sing together a song from a self @-@ merged pilgrims song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the local parish hall stood at the disposal . &quot;
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for tasty dishes and breakfast served at the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ iel@@ s Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to G@@ üt@@ enbach .
&quot; Е@@ т@@ и@@ к@@ е@@ т@@ и : in addition to St. Peter , one came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting track , had to cut around 500 metres of al@@ tim@@ eter and then re @-@ picked up again . &quot;
the promised reward was a joint s@@ akes in the evening .
&quot; after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage in the impos@@ ing monastery church of St. Peter , it went on the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; clearly , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Münster and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , God was thanks to God . &quot;
&quot; at the evening mass trade fair in Münster , the Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ i Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims could visit the sacri@@ sty and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ ze metropolis .
in the afternoon it went back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
&quot; Scot@@ sman Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med home , as Br@@ ite Gold for Rad@@ ar &quot;
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ste last night in the male team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio , when the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took his role , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y himself . he made the legend proud when he stor@@ med the legend in order to enter a win of the favorite New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympics projects . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after being in March at the railway world championships in London despite the retreat of Ho@@ ys just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as Hin@@ des .
&quot; Ho@@ ys retired , a gap that K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton tried to join . &quot;
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man who remained with whom they remained , when they saw potential in the sh@@ all@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ ds , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y Vic@@ ten - and S@@ kin@@ ner put an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the Stand@@ ar@@ dr@@ au@@ ts the New Zealand prevailed in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the Du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ ds was just under his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and S@@ kin@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a strategy changes made a great part of transformation , in which Hin@@ ds went into a higher gear to slow down and it Kenn@@ y and above all S@@ kin@@ ner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as an BBC expert in and fell S@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they went on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic champion and defeated the world champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 on the Site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there were Hin@@ des that he fell to the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objec@@ tion from England rival .
for this time there was no problem for this time .
Hin@@ des said : &quot; it feels like London with all the GB flags on the tribute like London . &quot;
we joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so bad with so many cos@@ tit@@ es so bad that it was amazing to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible in the field of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the UK sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster , were born on the day ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be like Ho@@ y &apos;s like .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint &apos;s Sprint which starts today and will run over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be defeated . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ alli@@ sts of the day , but there was other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ cket Wig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll quali@@ fies with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , who won gold in 2012 in London , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where the Wig@@ gins will be on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he was cont@@ ested before the qualification before the qualification , when the function@@ aries called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the appropriate women &apos;s competition , the morning continued and finished , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ate , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving its strong train team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a donation to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were driven . &quot;
&quot; in the background , Dr@@ amas played in the background as the resignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton &apos;s resignation in April , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you see the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite later than could the legendary call GB@@ S , who has reached its peak at the perfect moment . &quot;
&quot; future of the melting of Portland , due to lifting the energy agreement &quot;
&quot; the future of the aluminum sch@@ mel@@ ze of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand on the game , as the plant operator will termin@@ ate the energy providers , as the supplier has over@@ took energy companies . &quot;
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year . no further subsidies for operation of the plant was awarded .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ set sub@@ sid@@ y is scheduled for November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Portland , are on the game . &quot;
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk at risk .
&quot; in addition , it could come to domin@@ ate , as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa completed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closure . &quot;
&quot; this step follows the years of long spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the system , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar , and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which provides the large aluminium scra@@ pe with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Latin Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is located in the majority of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p should hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes from that the plant will continue to be operated in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting means &quot; divided the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the tre@@ aties were so called &quot; securing transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force on November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; contracts have a 12 months notice , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; hence , AG@@ L will assume that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of the strong dates for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L announced that the contracts had already written the value of the contracts at the amount of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts that make the ability to operate the &quot; Sk@@ ill ... the melting &quot; or ensure the power supply of the melting &quot; not damage .
&quot; the U.S. company said that there have been a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still an explanation , why it is still a statement of the contract . &quot;
&quot; analysts are war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the branch in front of the possible closure of the Portland melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland will consume around 900 mega@@ watts of electricity annually . &quot;
both systems should disappear from the market would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; and for us as power generators , that would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just one Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ hi@@ an J@@ ator C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
the dis@@ closure of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an ) as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ On@@ es and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as she ends the cover of her sister and ends with a classical spin : they have all planned a surprise art@@ y .
&quot; this represents almost every birthday party of a child of children ( Se@@ ac@@ claimed brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You &apos;ve been forgotten that we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; to participate with the hon@@ esty of a drawing office at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate in this Public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great sister Kim likes her to have defeated the Vog@@ ue cover ( her and her husband Kan@@ ye West , on April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resem@@ bles more than a fashion magazine as a fashion magazine , the output has a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were the 8@@ 32 pages of the Bear@@ er 615 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
the revel@@ ations of his co@@ ver@@ stars is expected that in the past two years of the magazine the magazine still le@@ ak off before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover were Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; over the last years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , &quot; the Model@@ n &quot; as &quot; Models , the celebr@@ ities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ Mark@@ enb@@ ot@@ ee Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even in the small chance that Ms. J@@ enner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; demol@@ ition model &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good society . &quot;
these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous people or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to handle a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though everything is available on J@@ enner ) .
they are really talented women who are looking out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers was a bit curious about fashion world in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Stephanie Sey@@ m@@ our J@@ enner and her colleagues in Gig@@ i H@@ adi@@ d and called her &quot; Mist@@ akes of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ves up again when the message came out with the release of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue cover .
but it seems to pass on the point to pass at the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is based on the cover of September issue of the V@@ os@@ ue .
it is in the true sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your prim@@ ers of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell your pictures from their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
it sells from her ge@@ ared pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the LO@@ VE magazine .
&quot; and in her leisure time , she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children . &quot;
&quot; community centers indicate a year 16@@ 0,000 people per year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid agencies will be rejected by the municipal centres annually , while the industry had already taken over the effects of further medium @-@ term transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just dol@@ og@@ ations and the similar , have been dismissed on free legal advice and legal services . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centres will lose further 30 percent of their federal government . &quot;
the Director of the Municipal Council of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last survey of the National Association of Municipal Council was revealed that thousands of people have already rejected every year .
Far@@ rell said that the situation without a repe@@ al of the government &apos;s decision would only be worse .
&quot; Queens@@ en community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning thousands of people from important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and afflicted debt , families who have passed by separ@@ ations , workers , the odd species and this survey shows that they can &apos;t receive assistance that they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the federal government will be reduced by 30 percent from June 2017 , meaning thousands of helpful needs to be forced from Queensland to be forced with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Prosecutor and the Federal Ministry of Justice , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise up these middle cuts immediately , so the people need help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled their promise to raise funds for legal action on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now at the time to view the needs of the community centers and their customers communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;

Berlin / Schwerin : survey in front of countries @-@ elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the governing party SPD and CDU . &quot;
this reported representative surveys of the research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could scar@@ ce almost further , this is not possible after the conditions in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and thus would have good chances to make the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only just under the CDU which could come back to 23 per cent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left hand would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; despite a slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8,7 per cent ) , the Gre@@ ens went back into the s@@ wis@@ s country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the property of 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the SPD &apos;s SPD election was only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 21.@@ 3.4 percent .
&quot; this is still a total of 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 per cent ) . &quot;
&quot; with 14 percent , Af@@ D was first represented in the Chamber of Dep@@ uties . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; E @-@ Mail and Internet in Tim@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago , the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market . &quot;
the followers today domin@@ ate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was di@@ cker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty knock . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at first eight Meg@@ abytes , which would be sufficient today for approximately two sel@@ ections with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone has now been delivered with at least 16 gig@@ abyte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers , lovers can still buy the devices in the internet , but they come from the stone time of the internet age . &quot;
&quot; but 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ bottle format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and emails were sent and receive , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to websites , it was possible to access the web browser by HTML browser . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and a electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone was quite similar to a laptop . &quot;
then a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen found .
&quot; the price was pretty proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. around 1400 euros . &quot;
the average price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
no one could see in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile phone card of Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market domin@@ ates all the much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always online and everywhere , that is today for many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
the global turnover of the devices is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunic@@ ations of telecommunic@@ ations .
&quot; around the Smartphone , a whole industry has been created . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the beginning of 2007 . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything by touch screen is easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; finally , you w@@ alled to fight Black@@ berry . &quot;
the S@@ agen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , every German is now looking at his mobile phone for 88 times a day . &quot;
&quot; we must all learn to get the smartphone even once again , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens executive board for personnel . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must lead the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
&quot; Heathrow will not only bring to our local community and in London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the largest attraction , as it was in London in 2012 when we run a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benef@@ ited from games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will be able to reach new opportunities for local and firms in the vicinity of Heathrow .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we are already preparing 10,000 new apprentices to create 40,000 new jobs and youth unemployment in the aviation environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were before us in London 2012 , there will be such that the challenge of the extension of the expansion is too big . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
the bi@@ fl@@ es were wrong in 2012 and they are also wrong in Heathrow .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but Heathrow answered every question . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , Heathrow is for many and not for individual infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a possibility to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , to create £ 211 billion in wit@@ ness@@ ing growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment by the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heathrow , which was chosen by a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure program in time and budget , from T5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the two frequencies of the world . &quot;
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one .
&quot; it is time that we expand this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow and create our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; K@@ atz und Maus@@ spiel &quot; &quot; on display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software survey attempts , advert@@ ise tests , a &quot; cat@@ chy and mouse play &quot; is equal to one of the software manufacturers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ade on his desktop @-@ side , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ g@@ post in which it hur@@ ried that users could upgrade their filters in the program to block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook with that his des@@ kt@@ on page would change the coding regarding its advertis@@ ements in order to identify it displays , which is part of the page advertising which is part of the page advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new path to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blo@@ g@@ post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this type H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the appe@@ aling open source community and the Um@@ bre@@ eders have already been in progress since the invention of advertis@@ ers in progress , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left the fight for social media in the fight is a strong indi@@ z for the industry .
&quot; according to a study from Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are used worldwide according to a study by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook over their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ies makes 84 percent of the value of fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has no effect on display block on desktop PCs , as mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker with . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient big share of revenues that Facebook is worth the investment of such step as a worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would be &quot; &quot; advertis@@ ements &quot; &quot; to update the people more control over them . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that there would be any new filter to block new filters because they would also block content on the side that are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users , this is not a positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ades are a dum@@ b means , why we have focused on Develop@@ er tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences instead , to lay more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on the Swiss highway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses after a woman in early morning hours on Thursday with a susp@@ icious suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred at the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; in a act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss live at the age of 49 , which was carried out by several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not been identified yet , the police said that these as well as any witnesses of the incident occurred . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ational procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter divided the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the driver will be displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash avo@@ id@@ able ?
&quot; that is something that the Prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the driver will not be moved to responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which one person in the dark on the highway ran - was decided that drivers don &apos;t need to go out that pede@@ stri@@ ans run in the middle of night on the highway , as it was written in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ eman of the dead murder was acquitted when she had survived a man and killed one night at the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the streets . &quot;
&quot; the court determined that the polic@@ eman had answered -- which had answered one emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; perfect exceptional and un@@ pre@@ dict@@ able situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report at the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhabited
Venus was most likely to be inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
&quot; scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorith@@ ms , which are similar to those of clim@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have taken up @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow circum@@ stance of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere , and yet slowly turned . &quot;
the model also lit the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to lodge life and protected sooner qu@@ icker . &quot;
early Venus also benef@@ ited from a sun that was 30 percent .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation exp@@ on@@ ates the slow shift of Venus to the sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io declared in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like a rain@@ bow , to cover the surface of a large part of s@@ ungl@@ asses . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a history of Venus , which resem@@ bles evolution that was previously suspected of plant@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; although it was once inhabited , Venus -- was exposed to a lot of heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years . &quot;
their oceans are ev@@ ap@@ orated and their water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when you with@@ drew hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know them today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy was back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a lower part of the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternatively @-@ President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately search for a new coach .
&quot; in the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and comp@@ act@@ ness , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy was held in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this is needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a decision @-@ to @-@ use decisions that affect the performance of the team .
currently these conditions are not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , was able to thank him for the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all what he has done for our organisation and wish him for the future only .
Roy was awarded the winner of Jack Adams Awards during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner &apos;s best trainer .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the last years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
the Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart won four Stanley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and Aval@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers take talks again and set strike out
&quot; during the re@@ mun@@ eration regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea oil workers , all parties shall put together for a new talk round at the table , said the negoti@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group , spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ mt trade unions can confirm that we have been united to re@@ start the winding process of current stri@@ ites , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will stop some full @-@ day meetings in the next weeks , starting at the beginning of the year to re@@ boot the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible pay@@ outs of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has cut the rati@@ ves to its contra@@ ctors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent drop for on@@ shore contra@@ ctors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts to the company gives the necessary room to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has announced for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to raise oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , since its operations are r@@ ational with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to the lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , economic situation that had to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June . &quot;
the Scottish par@@ liam@@ ent@@ ator Dave Anderson met with workers at the beginning of this week with workers to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes since a generation in the North Sea .
North Sea is important for the regional economy . he said .
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion for new projects are expected in the North Sea , compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures red @-@ rate of stars in the star@@ house of Ple@@ j@@ aden
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler space teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers helped to collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ations among the stars of the star@@ ring of Ple@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help Astr@@ onom@@ ics to understand why stars in the star@@ house are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context the rotation @-@ time rooms are facing the planet . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience the relationship between the composition of a star , his age , and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star@@ house of Ple@@ j@@ aden lies 4@@ 45 light years from Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
now turn the fastest one now .
&quot; at top rot@@ ations , these mature stars encounter large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the stars of stars , they have a slow effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star lies , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star taking the time between the appearance of an recogni@@ zable ast@@ er@@ isk -- like sun@@ spots -- recognize it .
&quot; the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that the more powerful stars slower than less massive stars . &quot;
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a bigger stars slower than smaller pist@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden , we see that slow rot@@ ors to be massage to be massive rot@@ ors to be better against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars . &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; since the star@@ house of Ple@@ j@@ aden is so close , it serves as an ideal cos@@ mop@@ olitan laboratory to compare the qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star@@ house of Ple@@ j@@ aden offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we would like to learn more about us , like how , when and why stars will slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang down their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of Ple@@ j@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astr@@ onom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star occurs from
tears ran to Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US @-@ bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
&quot; according to his emotional back@@ rest notice , the 41 year old professionals will carry on August 12 against the T@@ ampa Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
I tell &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to join the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Particip@@ ants of Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) .
&quot; in 2009 , Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won with Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , his signature has been signed by 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; by the end of the contra@@ diction on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hit and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , and since 2005 he made the Yan@@ ke@@ es for some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ Fame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two additional bas@@ eball player in the most important statistics have similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 year old would not be included in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so Rodri@@ guez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; in 2009 , the Super@@ star was commissioned by &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , forbidden ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was closed down to 211 games due to an execution in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez applies to an anti @-@ aging clinic for many years on an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot;
his deportation days are not no@@ is@@ eless too .
&quot; during many bas@@ eball legends in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit frequently on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job includes no deportation tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win each game , &quot; &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married to his actress Cameron Di@@ az , and the actress Kate Hudson and the actress Kate Hudson , was married , sympath@@ y @-@ def@@ ensive fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alled Boston Red SO@@ x . &quot;

&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish Wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter in Brazil were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the most critical Athletics competitions , these messages come to the accident . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic um hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was also proven to be used as m@@ asked agent for d@@ oping sub@@ stan@@ sts last Sunday . &quot;
the International Sport@@ geri@@ chtshof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon their exclusion of the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the finals over 100 m Butter@@ fly only about 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part over 50 m free style on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) , Ch@@ en granted the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing . &quot;
&quot; National Association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands of Ch@@ en full co @-@ operation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; X@@ in@@ hua out of a communication : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ court Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer the IOC , but the CA@@ S is responsible for the athl@@ ete of the athl@@ ete with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio , the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; this is an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the lightweight athle@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should act on the banned substance to act the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ ival EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was given provisional release , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow immediately applied immediately with criticism of the athl@@ ete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sport@@ s@@ men do not draw the right battles , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; we are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all the wei@@ ght@@ li@@ fter from the chron@@ ically resi@@ li@@ ent nation cannot participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the event &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ sky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ ab@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on . &quot;
&quot; both den@@ ying the intake , both are not allowed to start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; prior to the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another serious blow for the reputation of entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association had the entire Russian team up to an exception due to System@@ atic D@@ op@@ ings , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming @-@ sport , the former publishers in China had also fed the athletes between athletes and athletes . &quot;
so the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt , purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ estyle I will pass over , &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a meditation on the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ orton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for D@@ oping bet@@ we@@ ger , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested positive for the Chinese championships in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month sperm . &quot;
data kl@@ au : per@@ fi@@ de presses their delete money
programm@@ ers of ext@@ ortion malware are currently targeted and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware ab@@ wehr specialists , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes were among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 per cent of the surveyed companies were at least once more than part of a attack with ext@@ ortion software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 per cent of companies were already the target of a Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion . &quot;
40 per cent of the victims were willing to be used by the perpet@@ rators required to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators are specialized in their opening software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate network .
&quot; if they are successful there , they are considerably higher than for private use . &quot;
&quot; we currently observe a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the pollut@@ ant software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most malaria programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered replacement software for themselves .
only private users were the target but the change to company att@@ acking took place in the past few months .
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once upon the computer of a victim , they are looking for targeted files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustainable .
&quot; then , the software presents the recei@@ v@@ ables recei@@ v@@ ables . &quot;
&quot; to get the final key code to the files , the victims must be money - usually in the form of Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ ast Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private use the personal photo database on the game stands , it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage caused if a Ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the affected German firms reported sales losses due to Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break down the business activity , with a case of people in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of ambul@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pay not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of perpet@@ rators in the operation . &quot;
h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the researchers from F @-@ Secure have examined the user surface and the contact with the press@@ ors and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money . &quot;
&quot; you explain their victims per chat , as they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ t freely for example . &quot;
&quot; and they will have redeemed private people after payments of a few hundred euros , companies need to deal with hard to negoti@@ ate and get five @-@ digit sum@@ s in order to rec@@ ap@@ point their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ ext@@ ortion , the h@@ ack@@ ers are always professional and share the work , explains security experts from the Antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a Ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software in the form of a software structure to the actual press@@ er .
&quot; the malware kits were created by malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; delivery includes a adap@@ t@@ ool , so that smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the ext@@ ortion is then looking for further h@@ acker to spread the fresh bought software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buys the set of a criminal and t@@ asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is carried out per in@@ ized calcul@@ ator .
&quot; typically , the crimin@@ als then apply sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better .
more than 50 per cent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ Software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful path@@ o@@ ung more , the perpet@@ rators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; declared Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the dam@@ aging of damage depending on type of data is still higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could go totally new targets on the internet of things to the grain . &quot;
on the h@@ ack@@ er@@ conference def@@ con demonstr@@ ators demonstrate how to get a thermo@@ stat with the Internet Explorer thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the fre@@ ed@@ ging of a der@@ art blocked heating could not be worth a ran@@ s@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators will then block a whole production line in a factory in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in the industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; really un@@ loading , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , has actually changed in everyday life as extremely flexible . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the f@@ ond lot of space , there is no place at any point . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well processed and are comfortable , only the cockpit top falls there . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V at the storage room .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with top @-@ up and 10@@ 26 l , with folded back @-@ down back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat areas of the rear bench can be swi@@ vel@@ ed as Kin@@ os@@ bo@@ ilers and offer the storage space that is high from the floor to the ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than in comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he is likely to set a little more quiet . &quot;
gr@@ ati@@ fying is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another engine of engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a bit more direct .
the equipment in the tested top version &quot; Executive &quot; does not allow any desires to be desired .
the City @-@ Not@@ e@@ brake assistant ( works up to the pace of 32 ) is one of the coll@@ ision system and the trace assistant .
&quot; sometimes , the coll@@ isions irrit@@ ated sometimes , because he has been rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ent objects &quot; in the ranking . &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliable .
&quot; and the intelligent speed controller , respon@@ ds to the traffic detection detection and dro@@ pp@@ le when needed . &quot;
&quot; the full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something to reach .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top diesel is fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the gasoline engine will receive from 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and versatile car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow of air@@ lift
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger to the passenger bridge .
&quot; as a liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable due to dangers which are typical for air traffic , the Upper Regional Court of Düsseldorf argu@@ ed ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had broken down in the fall of a knee .
&quot; the accident , however , could happen everywhere - there is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease : when paid the organizer
&quot; after their journey , we only get money back after their journey , when the cause of the disease is desper@@ ate freely in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests can present the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negoti@@ ating case , a family was heavily ill on the second day of their tur@@ qu@@ ur@@ l@@ ur@@ gery . &quot;
she spent nearly all the holiday in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sounds which allegedly killed the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip was not lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; before court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the situation in fact was defective . &quot;
but the promot@@ er did not know just before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
&quot; until then , he had to go out that the sea water was fine . &quot;
&quot; so he didn &apos;t hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially in the samples of water , no contamination were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with one another - belong to the general risk of life .
&quot; of 6@@ 91 guests , only 38 were ill . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said after the crimes committed violence in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about another attacks . &quot;
the state must be sober and determined to react to terror at the same time .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and split .
we will not allow this triumph .
&quot; if off@@ ender had to leave the country faster , this is the security and strength of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of proposals until the federal election of 2017 .
&quot; he also announced a further person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , although &quot; in medium four @-@ digit order order over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ y advertising for terrorism must be under punishment again .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire is expected to increase in the Internet , especially the purchase of weapons in the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors is supposed to remain after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical board , he wants to search for solutions as the endanger@@ ing of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of mental conditions . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the minister holds a better social responsibility . &quot;
teachers would have to be prepared better for dealing with trau@@ matic people .
&quot; for the persecution of crimin@@ als in the specific areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning an investig@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to security , to increase security . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against shareholder .
&quot; that was a ear@@ ne@@ phe@@ w for the hing@@ es in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had dropped out of the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of the double nationality previously rejected .
a generic prohibition of complet@@ eness he contents for constitutional problems .
&quot; you can &apos;t understand everything , which one re@@ jects , and I rest the wearing of bur@@ ka . &quot;
they could speak about rules about road traffic or witness before court .
green @-@ boss Simone Peter threw the Minister he wants to sim@@ ulate and sim@@ ulate new anti @-@ terror p@@ act power and action .

better traffic flow on the motorway
it looked regularly on the road @-@ road - here a picture of November .
but that is supposed to change : the de@@ fle@@ ction is to be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in professional traffic on the ground road every evening when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
&quot; on upcoming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , road transport extends between the Hammer Street and the departure of Wes@@ eler Street , the right @-@ lane to 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can ski@@ pped directly from the hammer on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , whereby the total area is improved on the multiple section of the Federal Road 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea was extended with the extended exit , the CDU faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the driving force on the Zu@@ br@@ inger was nervous the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; week@@ days goes back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ ping road , and sometimes also in addition . &quot;
reason is the imp@@ ec@@ cable on the B 51 short before the departure of Wes@@ eler Street .
&quot; from here , traffic will only be guided via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be re@@ built before the three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge is no longer necessary to absorb the load of heavy traffic .
&quot; how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and that will take up with the associated St@@ au , the competent state can &apos;t say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to expect : for the bridge has an official rest time until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state @-@ operation consci@@ ously sought the traffic noise in school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the Club Nim@@ a &apos;s and the boy Theater are planning a music project now .
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s association offers young people with mig@@ rant and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule nursery school has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the boys Theater Münster , Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the association Nim@@ a &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip , &quot; 19 pupils from eleven to 15 years attended the st@@ aging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background to the aim of visiting schools with welcome classes , to visit this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic pictures and video animations , it would have been possible to follow the release of the Young The@@ aters Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , created by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the boy theatre will work in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , adolescents with and without flight and migration background should be obtained between 14 and 20 years , professional guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the theatre game and the@@ atri@@ cal language placement are in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased refugee numbers , the association with many classes , who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope of weather repair
&quot; the weather has made the stars in the southwest of Germany in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday , but there is hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the night is bad because of clouds and rain were badly suited to observe the sky spectac@@ le , said the chairman of the ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather shall be good , then we will see many stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the shooting sli@@ pping , it is Per@@ ei@@ den , which belong to the quick@@ est stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , it is round about , at night you wake up hours , in the morning it is far before the wake @-@ up cl@@ auses does not think any more of sleep . &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; after all , there is no problems with such problems in good society : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults have sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent on their sleep frequent or permanent than not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep problems ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ ff@@ or@@ atory and Sle@@ ep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , however , is the In@@ som@@ nie , so there is an entry and a sleep@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just that can be sleeping , many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , Member of the board of the German House@@ hold association with practice in the Sax@@ on @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it , organic , psychological or de@@ structive factors can also be used . &quot;
not rare is the sleeping expression of another disease .
&quot; very early awakening is often common in case of depression , &quot; says We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that various factors are be@@ ating each other .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be bad , all the two to three hours and starts to greet you about everyday problems and car@@ rot , and there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week , and that day should be imp@@ aired , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , imm@@ ov@@ ing , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood fluctu@@ ations or physical problems such as mag@@ nets or headache . &quot;
&quot; in order to relie@@ ve the sleep distur@@ bing , it is important to find the causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , behavi@@ oral changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ qu@@ ire . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ ber , head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center of the Char@@ ité University Hospital , Berlin , is hardly emphas@@ ized in Germany . &quot;
&quot; that is why , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the house@@ keeper , advis@@ es We@@ eks . &quot;
it can clari@@ fy with investigations if the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should be in the sleep laboratory , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the sleep laboratory medical laboratory , for example , at snor@@ ing with respiratory tra@@ cting , in disease , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ ord explains . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the investigation .
one should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; after the c@@ abling , one goes into bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body you carries a nose g@@ og@@ gles , a chest strap and a ant@@ enn@@ as on the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling . &quot;
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
there are quite many positions where you can set for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ ar counts on : regular sleep and departure times , not to sleep long in bed , not sleep on the day , not television to sleep , alcohol , and at night watch - then it starts immediately to calculate , and that &apos;s quite and not possible . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has sold himself by Facebook to dis@@ appointing the DS@@ V teams near Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he had brought gold for the first ground@@ breaking championships in Doha , and set his first world record at the same time . &quot;
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook has sho@@ cked his criticism in the criticism of the ex @-@ team mate .
&quot; in a country in which an Olympic team receives 20,000 € premium and a Dsch@@ ung@@ el@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € should nobody wonder about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; so , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much , and do not even operate on the topic D@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be adjusted here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; he wanted to start a com@@ eback , D@@ ei@@ bler would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a certain time before the World Cup / OS control of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A can &apos;t participate , it must not be able to run an ice@@ di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : Bande was arrested by luggage
professional th@@ ie@@ ves at the airport Düsseldorf
the police officers of the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrested the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ susp@@ ect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs and luggage steels .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the airport of Düsseldorf had again known a gang that was known to the police officers of the past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several delic@@ acy since the mid @-@ July of this year , and were more common , lab@@ elled and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ al 34 can also refer to the th@@ ats , who had traveled to Germany for crimes of crimes in Germany , four actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had more than 15.000 euros . &quot;
&quot; alto buildings , a couple of lin@@ king trees , in between still a rest of a stone pav@@ ement : the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sha@@ in works on the first sight , but the police is among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walk down the road from the east to the west , one comes to play@@ grounds , a refresh@@ ed nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which should be demolished also soon , it is already built : by 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy area , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , will be preferred by burning cars in the last weeks . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , the residents have now occupied rental contracts , on the ground floor , are still occupied spaces and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator handle has been very hard for a tough advance of the police against the project , the area as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous force . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rou@@ ded the police , with 30 to 40 officials and three team drivers on site , closed parts of the road and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the independent builder was commissioned by the unknown home owner . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative court ruled that the evacu@@ ation had been illegal , and one day later , police and workers under the youth of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents departed . &quot;
&quot; on this summer , the road acts peac@@ efully : parents go with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk before the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain@@ ed in late late . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the hood , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main care of many residents : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who are here three children , are generated above all of the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the hood , they share the care of increasing ten@@ ants and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted to re@@ side the majority of police protection from v@@ andal@@ ous left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin Inn@@ ens@@ ator and the police are doing between house@@ ers and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which is also in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; houses and those born living projects are already long as Kie@@ z : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including almost the entire Main Street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was cleared under large police officers in a regular road battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a mag@@ nets for tourists and elec@@ tr@@ ber@@ lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them now residents from GDR times and former household occupied their Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this has also been noticeable in the r@@ ying noticeable , which has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them to designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades which were subjected to colours .
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year , together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous force . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours may be considered a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the largest part of the off@@ ences make property damage , which ten@@ ds to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , which has been living in a rental house beside the controversial 94 , can be no speech by un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; regarding violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been determined . &quot;
even the famous burning cars do not give it right in the Rig@@ a@@ er longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is no criminal law , on the contrary : &quot; here you can help one another , lives together on the road and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the residents returned their road : from the police , politics and the media , which all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of residents such as new@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to be taken away : by su@@ peri@@ odi@@ ous re@@ constructions in former building blocks , which stri@@ ves the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domin@@ iums , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so good , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction , I absolutely not gu@@ arding . &quot;
&quot; but what do you do , if any one listen to someone ? &quot;
&quot; there are fru@@ stration among all sides , even during the police and the residents . &quot;
K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding about paint bombs . K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the hood and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; whoever moves , should be aware of his - just like someone who moves into a pub , where bad about noise can be complain there . &quot;
&quot; all persons only presented with pre@@ names were therefore asked to be called , not called with her right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee camp
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the response partner in the integration and organizer .
&quot; in addition , she is a social worker . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ y supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a response partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugees , administration , authorities and who else are involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine Client from the working group indicates that the honorary volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , which has a problem , especially a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked as much rather than the variety of desired responsibilities - meant , as the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; sought an administrative service with a talent of different languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving wool mil@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not their central area , writes Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is going to organisation , work with the people on site and behind the scenes , as well as network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing this for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent point to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ ing and Vol@@ un@@ official players supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; there has been a heavy problem since some time , apartments for connecting @-@ to @-@ refugees that have been recognized . &quot;
the local authorities are responsible for the connections .
they need to accommodate refugees in own or rented homes .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accomod@@ ations need to bear the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from Land@@ rat@@ ory and Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer its apartment . &quot;
the search has been designed for some time than very difficult .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not functional to use private apartments so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , gener@@ ously must be found as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are installed in the was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are practical courses , training places , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants who are frozen or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reported Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many works in the building yard or help home master , do non @-@ profit labour - and the motivated and very neat , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
it hopes that work for the community leads to a positive external effect .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; activity , however , does not mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a conc@@ essions .
&quot; so do they need offerings such as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you can jump here administration and honorary positions .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are allowed in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you have to explain the refugees that it takes , and you can easily over@@ bridges the time , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach cannot work and be un@@ profitable , who will never integrate itself . &quot;
the distinct majority may be motivated .
&quot; but there is a problem , however , the customer says hon@@ estly , &quot; people , in which nothing goes wrong . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two were afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ holes might call na@@ ive &quot; . &quot; a residual risk could be done and would not exclu@@ de them out . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these inci@@ dents were also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks may complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and honorary positions must keep on site and in the region after activities . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they are always in the background that soon a new Sto@@ ß could come to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question , the policy is afraid . &quot;
actually it is un@@ fair to put them hel@@ pers on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived there , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees that would relax the situation .
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the ur@@ b@@ acher , too , are well utilized to integrate the previous people reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , you need to help them , are both women . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there is no easy answers . &quot;
