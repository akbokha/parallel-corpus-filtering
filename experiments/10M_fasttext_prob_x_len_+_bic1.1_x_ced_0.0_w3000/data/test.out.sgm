<seg id="1">Clinique and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - that's both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however on the tax and energy policy as well as in a basic demand."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small, and warns that the state can hurt the economy - with taxes and regulators."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton would climb the economy to death and regulate to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"however, he himself would be different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return Regulations, and he stands for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates strong - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to meet, he has trained benevolving opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in which must be invests, Trump and Clinton say almost the same."</seg>
<seg id="14">The Democratic Canberin announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are denied by the state-critical teacy wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump could thus come to party discussions.</seg>
<seg id="17">Clearly are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal plants and reboating coal transport in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in so far protected areas, oil promotion should also be possible to terminate the Paris climate agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton wants to extend the renewable energies with their investment program explicitly and calls: "a country will create the superpower of clean energy and millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be China, Germany or America - I want to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, which come to travel-fish trade agreements, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the USA would not want to isolate from international trade, but simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better, for instance, for instance."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7,25 US dollars is a hungry. "</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump in this question is to do is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be rassed, then he says he would not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to devote the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him, so the budget deficit would only be larger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich man wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every fledged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"if they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatic."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in a large kitchen, four women are sitting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in the arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother starved on the table plate.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the executive director of Condrobs, a carrier for social auxiliary agencies in Bavaria, and among other things are women on the flight."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fledged.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the Munich North, one of the few decentralised accommodations for all-fledged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Guide."</seg>
<seg id="18">She was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who comes here, has made his escape experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are politically persecuted, because they are torture or death, or because their families were sending them as hopes to Europe," she tells her. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal away secretly because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home, they have experience with sexual violence, forced, honorary moral, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, the tug demands a bottle of water for a bottle of water is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"whoever believes that the end, as soon as they come in Germany, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, all women in refugee camps would often be regarded as a minderous and worst in case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the Munich north, is traumatic."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so great that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they do not trust, openly about the living, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"often they are often unable to help, there are more accommodations only for them, calls Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether they knew from a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, answer some with No."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz region and Oberfranken, there are not something in accommodations for governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Schwaben alone, women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press-precher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Sub- and Middle franken, there are some shared floors or houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if men and women are accommodated together, there may be too - ongoing - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"especially the shower room should be separated, and for women easily accessible, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much women feel this protective needs, you can read the Andrang's House in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have spoken around, we have a long queue," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Relations"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up his hands and an official end of eight months, to proclaim the words of the words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counteractor in the gilded room of St. Petersburg Palastes in reception, I cannot defend myself this propitiation in most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it gave the hand, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrolily and he barely radiated heat for its restrained conditions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also said that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper, that Erdogan would have behaved this way, would never happen to happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in me, his enthusiasm appeared to indicate the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that the Russian President of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first what he mentioned in his project words: the surplus of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wishing.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin sent out and accused Ankara to please Russia into the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the going was even bigger, as it was committed by a missed friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the vetrable building, it becomes difficult, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the nationally controlled media led a strong, unlimited attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once again, the Turks would bear to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the accusations of leading officials, that Erdogan's own family have benefited from illegal oil trading in the provinces of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire is clear on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan takes place in the first line of all friends, which he can get after the last month with a failed coup d" état almost his sentence. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economical motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights each year usually bring several million Russian tourists to Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal accumulation of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the State television broadcasts fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" tourists there for long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, as it considers the reaction to the attempted power of power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persistent Groll on the snow-empo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike is to move from cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian state leader won a bonus in Ankara with security that he asked for a coup d" état support for the chosen state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is true for Moscow, a self-understandable, which even change a deep fear of regime."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit meeting this glorious palace in this glorious palace in the ocean allowed Russia and Turkey, as it was a analysts at the" Alliance of Foreign side ": two countries that put away from the West and will feel bad."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still large differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently delivered the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support mutual sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be noted that after almost three hours of first talks on the press conference, both President told them that they had not even striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey missed it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there is no clear consensus above, where a common denominator can be found to Syria."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, NATO member of Turkey discarded the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of heads will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="24">IVANOV increased the post in December 2011.</seg>

<seg id="4">The SPD strikes for the next rating of a "action concept."</seg>

<seg id="6">First line is about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Christoph Bratmann stated:" we are living with the Greens: "" who wants to build us with the Greens: those who want to build in urban areas, 20 percent of all flats have to be held as social housing. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"the favorable apartments, however, can also arise in stock."</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Yet the program does not yet stand fully: for the approx. 1260 new apartments that should be ready to be built.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compare the loss of more about 1,300 inexpensive apartments, whose funding will run out in the next few years?"</seg>

<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shout his course on a euro notes, a banister on Piccadilly Circus, a washing machine at Piccadilly Circus, a washing machine on a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resistance to its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before the clocks of any object, he used a Luminometer to show itself and show us what he will interfere."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filming under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "some surprising results brought to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsing head of a pulling toilet, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely shocking, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen spula more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals across the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"luckily, nothing left what he ableaked, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known for this to test the resistance of his actors by the world, as well as wonderful as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public railways to train stations up to the rots of toilets, the task posed his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the movie he told:" already as a child I was relatively unworried about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was just righteous in his call."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only one he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His propony showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, Luminometric number is freshly washed hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse, after their Luminometric number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number of different places like the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This comes the worst thing I have smoked in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'll do nothing here because it is inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company hosted Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumer really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating for watching and simultaneously explains the advantages of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led crazy Brainstormings that we ended that we said "Let us call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">You claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and as it is associated with the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we managed to provide more information on an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film of the film, added:" let me tell me - I would have lost my respect for Ian when he had tasted some of the things I need to do, as the ecstatic Russian toilet which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there was things in which it was easier to bring Ian to put them and others, where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats in film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Valio survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents, lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they are at least occasionally products containing the concerned lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="27">But it is not possible to address that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were killed.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people in view of the high refugee numbers were concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="5">"those who have bought a record recently, are all prediction after the age between 45 and 54."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely Käuferous group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyers - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables keep their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report in television, I would follow the camera, while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a modest grey suit, before I stand, keep my hands and say something like:" so let us take a look at the sight. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly entering its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now fill the buildings where once independent sales are based - there is a handful fantastic record specialist."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the camera to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores, and try to estimate their age and mind."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart Ray, 55, whom I follow by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into the Reckless Records (data number: eight men's middle age, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I'm not followed him home), clothed the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: it is now able to buy disks, which he had not been able to buy them, when he had been published, when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late 1960s, early '70s, which appeared, when I was 11 or 12. things, with whom I was probably too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is true that those who want to buy records, rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke, and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my leaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, believes that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about comeback and let themselves go to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have disposed of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers that once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to a particular age of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record shops offers a calm community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took a violation of the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed from the digital world, and would like to withdraw the stability of trusted sound platforms, from objects, the happy jugenders."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as collector so I think it is so many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" flattered a staff of a platform. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record have bought a record, they haven't heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey was also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record, have no turntables."</seg>
<seg id="37">At that time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I blacks a stack to Bossa Nova Compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone was recently released here and said," I have no turntable, but I would like to buy a radio record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicastic."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people who say: "I have no turntable."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger men, not older, who only come to clean."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the sound plates almost a whole floor, has a blowable audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists, the pictures make, teens and women aged middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beaches of the latest synthesizer- and sexbepackers pop instead of experimental jazz drills from the speakers - is it good to see such diversities in the customer.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks strange indeed, but brand psychotic traumas are difficult to determine if one stands for about 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variation of the records for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a mannephew as a large store.</seg>
<seg id="50">"they do not deserve much, therefore collecting records no real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to hear music from one computer, or to other way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives with a veraging sighs. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a shop that is said that a new generation of record lovers is inspired by: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the certificate that Jeans, I observe a group of young girls who grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras, before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above, that it is impossible to summarize them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for this objects mean more money for the industry, and some customers could give to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most of luxury objects such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research practices revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they do, at least in turntables in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record-lovers, which exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineforen exist."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with safety, not with the booths by record shops of the Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old-old presenter, who rises nothing about the shoulders of the middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of provisorical shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live in the jungle."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in case of a trial hearing these week, the authorities in Calais argued that the State should be merged to sell 72 provisorical stores, in which persons sold within the camp goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdresser services can sell or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would be paid a parallel economy to be paid out of which no taxes would be paid and the fire and sanitation risk.</seg>

<seg id="6">"moreover, they led out that the provisorical shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille chose that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people that operate the 72 provisorical shops, however, that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are absolutely recommendable."</seg>

<seg id="9">He said that the areas are quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the precipitation was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is generally operated and 200 meals a day, English and French classes and a consultation on asylum seekers for the hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>

<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a lot of women with dimples, could definitely be sent to the Prime Time, built by sponsors and charity TV advertising, when he would be a swimmers, Turner or even Freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fighting for the Olympic trampolines around gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit any event.</seg>

<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may reign for long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I'm modest, making arguments for my particular favorites, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampolins."</seg>

<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end up - but also the grazie of the gym and dew, the two sports that combines it essentially."</seg>

<seg id="3">"demonstrators demand political changes in Ethiopia, fighting for violent resistance of the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the protesters were killed during clashes with the police in shussing.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just dealing with?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally-growing economy with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and widespread in more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people on roads and requested fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's answer was unmerciful according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses reported that policemen killed unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about protests, probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security men suggest young people with bumps while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN Authority for Human Rights now demands a temporary investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and going to become even more difficult," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated from the west.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians, in order to combat terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expands in considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendable train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia everything was other than a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continued the repression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, whereby dissidents have been put into silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or transferred to prison, or put into the wilderness of the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except for protesting, it breaks out," "Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in the Ethiopian Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints to cover everything from the land of soil to worms in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after an extensive elections last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the stresses along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zacky, controversial line demanded in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front, or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced in recent years, could benefit the turbulences and could be armed."</seg>
<seg id="29">"several factors explain why feelings of the delay after years ago, Hinkuckns are now explode under the surface."</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were always more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does in regular intervals, do many people still communicate via Internet Proxies to hide, where they can stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they were gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since Equations prospered the Amharas, which come from Equthopia, mainly Christian floods, in the politics and economy, while they are exploited to the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, in trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel guide, was up to his death in a nonsense disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">"analysts say that he was particularly in it, early signs of dissatisfaction, and Special Representative to work and make them unharmful."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is missing in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unclear reasons to increase the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who arrived from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam coming from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he enjoys the trust of the security services provided by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more blood shed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, according to the analysis of analysis, and then stolen from the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razicia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlersuit, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not respect Intensification of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protests in Gondar, a amharic city, managed by Tigray, and the hatred towards the Tigray is always more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that protests in the United States and other Western allies have a unique position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though she was recently agreed that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"during the west, democracy wants to support democracy, he doesn't want to unite his ally in a volatilous area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr. Abdi said," is a very thin hike. "</seg>

<seg id="15">"they were prepared from an ingredient, and a little cheap, which flows the ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine so many peanuts have to eat that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have laid down in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, a All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women coves for male Fellow, and it was freshly baked pastel served for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans that sent to hungry Europeans during the first World War." "a Square Meal" "shows the ways to deal with which the country went, not to be the slaughter."</seg>

<seg id="23">"the new Budgetdiets: mysterious meals such as breads and weatherollen were to be staple as" wonderful way, eating residues, "because Köche could hide unappetiable ingredients under a creative sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, that was the center of American kitchen for years, became a rare serfourth luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"unique mixtures were tried, as a calorie rich and nourishing satisfaction came forward to taste or even healthy kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a court from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"there was no more popular addition at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues from: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions not fit each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the household concepts.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as never before or since then, domestic economics - including Louise Stanley, Head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by making recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines, they encourage women to become" budgetolitives "and the challenge to transform Pampe as creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals."</seg>

<seg id="40">"President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to outfit him with his stomach."</seg>

<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of the Great Depression, with food, was rejected, once the land came again into the legs."</seg>

<seg id="50">"there was no added sour cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>

<seg id="2">More rarely sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland will usually come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h by the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland won only 150 years old.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland floating in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is on average 1,220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes on, it accelerates the five metre long animal to a satte 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">This long-loneliness lifestyle seems to be a firm for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues will report in the journal "Science" at a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Schadventlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock these lifespan, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist thought that Greenlandhaie become a stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenlandhaie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice sea front of the thin-populated coastal coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear in the surface only in the winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have a little bit about the lifestyle of Greenland.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their time-pentempt limbs them, when they had six animals on a station before Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of a animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had shocked the pine bone of a young ice cream."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the iceberg and seek Kadaver, which torch from higher water layers downwards."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenlandhaie, fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as a catch from the depths of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 cm measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the carbon-14 method of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye-lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, which contained proteins later is no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the overall length of 220 centimeters, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 out of nuclear weapons, it is likely to be celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland had the normal carbon-14-amounts due to cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 cm long Greenland was a age of 335 years, while the record shark was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-females can only get offspring if they are longer than four meters.</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, researchers were able to arrange the length of the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters is probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age of 156 years, Grönlandhaie, with the multiplication of at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">The world record is likely to be present for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon was put a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the body of living animals are often living on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, they tyres later - and aloud slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">"therefore, the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram elephant."</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives in dangerous animals and should focus on it as early as possible, as early as possible as many descendants," says the Evolutionsbiologist Schadventlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should rather invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">Venus was most likely to be inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">"scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms, which are similar to those of climbers."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have taken up-like conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow circumstance of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet presumably pointed out more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to lodge life and protected sooner quicker."</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware abwehr specialists, Malwarebytes were among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 per cent of the surveyed companies were at least once more than part of a attack with extortion software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 per cent of companies were already the target of a Ransomware-extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims were willing to be used by the perpetrators required to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators are specialized in their opening software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in corporate network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, they are considerably higher than for private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently observe a terrifying rapid evolution of the pollutant software," says Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most malaria programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered replacement software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target but the change to company attacking took place in the past few months.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once upon the computer of a victim, they are looking for targeted files such as Word-, Excel- or database files as well as archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then, the software presents the receivables receivables."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final key code to the files, the victims must be money - usually in the form of Cryptoast Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private use the personal photo database on the game stands, it works with companies around sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage caused if a Ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the affected German firms reported sales losses due to Ransomware, 13 percent even had to break down the business activity, with a case of people in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of ambulances."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pay not, you only promotes the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 per cent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of perpetrators in the operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">Hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the researchers from F-Secure have examined the user surface and the contact with the pressors and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to increase more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you explain their victims per chat, as they can pay per Bitcoin, set free accessible support websites, or decrypt freely for example."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and they will have redeemed private people after payments of a few hundred euros, companies need to deal with hard to negotiate and get five-digit sums in order to recappoint their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware-extortion, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security experts from the Antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a Ransomware approximately within one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, is that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software in the form of a software structure to the actual presser.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the malware kits were created by malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"delivery includes a adaptool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The extortion is then looking for further hacker to spread the fresh bought software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums in the underground, buys the set of a criminal and tasked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is carried out per inized calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"typically, the criminals then apply spammer with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that make their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 per cent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey trust that Ransomware can be able to defend Ransomware by file-Back-ups and ScannerSoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful pathoung more, the perpetrators instead of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," declared Malwarebytes-boss Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the damaging of damage depending on type of data is still higher than before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could go totally new targets on the internet of things to the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">On the hackerconference defcon demonstrators demonstrate how to get a thermostat with the Internet Explorer thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the freedging of a derart blocked heating could not be worth a ransom."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, it is round about, at night you wake up hours, in the morning it is far before the wake-up clauses does not think any more of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, there is no problems with such problems in good society: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults have sleeping disorders and more than ten per cent on their sleep frequent or permanent than not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep problems?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeks, board member of the German Society for Slefforatory and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, however, is the Insomnie, so there is an entry and a sleepy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just that can be sleeping, many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, Member of the board of the German Household association with practice in the Saxon-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it, organic, psychological or destructive factors can also be used."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common in case of depression," says Weeks. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors are beating each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can be bad, all the two to three hours and starts to greet you about everyday problems and carrot, and there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a month of a month in at least three nights a week, and that day should be impaired, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, immoving, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood fluctuations or physical problems such as magnets or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to relieve the sleep disturbing, it is important to find the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or drugs - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquire."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fiber, head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center of the Charité University Hospital, Berlin, is hardly emphasized in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the housekeeper, advises Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with investigations if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should be in the sleep laboratory, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the sleep laboratory medical laboratory, for example, at snoring with respiratory tracting, in disease, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disturbance, Fiord explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch break," "says Fiber."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the cabling, one goes into bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body you carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a antennas on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is characterized by the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite many positions where you can set for a better sleep.</seg>
