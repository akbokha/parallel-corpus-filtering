Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not really friendly .
the two wanted to address the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran will speak dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; but with the encounter , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ states solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been very anxi@@ ous since years .
Washington as@@ sures the continuing settlements of Israel and raises Netanyahu the lack of peace in the peace process .
by the deal of Obama deal around the Iranian nuclear programme the relationship between the two continued wor@@ sen@@ ed .
&quot; in March , Netanyahu announced the invitation to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in front of the US Congress which had been used as an affair against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken about Obama , a meeting with regard to the upcoming election in Israel was rejected . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor takes refuge to be shot dead . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon , with a somewhat hard voice of the police , told him that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials will have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive , and probably live , and he said , the dead contact of the dead woman could be found on the mobile . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials requested the suffering from Amy Pr@@ un@@ iss and a handwritten note that I wanted to go on a white sheet : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I loved it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who had traveled two online courses for the Delta State University in Cleveland , Mississippi , had already travelled hundreds of miles to the school grounds , where he was shot and killed in two online courses , e@@ thane Schmidt , at the door of his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zed Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford claimed that all university collabor@@ ators have heard about 10 : 18 .
&quot; he said that lamb had taken the fat@@ eful emergency call eventually , sometime later . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took up life , when the police captured him . &quot;
&quot; a day after shooting in the university , students and teachers forced to hide themselves behind closed doors , the authorities are still trying to get a picture of what is being motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the teachers at both ends of the state were , as well , what students and employees who know him , helped me to draw a picture of a talented , but perhaps difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ un@@ iss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Mr. himself had mentioned in a book written by him in a written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both worked in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose profess@@ ors encomp@@ asses 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were some in@@ clin@@ ations to problem@@ atic behavi@@ our@@ al behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ avers , who gave praise to the lamb , said he also seemed to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; as if something goes wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he tells Lucas that he had to do at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
&quot; lamb had previously asked the Delta State University to be asked for health reasons , saying that he had any health problem in any health problem . &quot;
&quot; this year , he only instructed two online courses . &quot;
&quot; the latest amendments to the University &apos;s employment policy believed that the promotion , for which lamb had worked hard for him , would not be an automatic way to work as Assistant Professor for him . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that cannot answer the Lamb .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police found Lam@@ swe@@ a later when he drove back to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 Cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house on the outskirts of a house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Washington County Cor@@ oner Pad@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran even in the entry .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the region .
&quot; lamb began his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants , trained in ge@@ ography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in spring education in spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends , Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Car@@ la hair@@ ston was saying it was 15 and the lamb was 20 when they met together through mutual friends .
&quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool old guy who tried some years to teach her guitar game . &quot;
then he was a sho@@ vel at that time .
&quot; all girls melted down when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson County of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were present some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick House , ad@@ joining a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ un@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced for 15 years ago , but friends were left and had a daughter who was now 19 . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed in the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met lamb , but he listened to Ab@@ ig@@ ail from his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , that lamb were interested in music and blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ ab@@ iss , as he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared before three years ago on a summer fair . &quot;
later they played together the one or other gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en told her daughter , she sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ un@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a dedicated bar tender and sometimes convers@@ ant coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak light bar near G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had ended lamb and Pr@@ un@@ iss night during the night of September 5 , after giving his guitar and harmon@@ ica finished before a sp@@ icious audience . &quot;
there were no indications that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the lift and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of joke .
&quot; Schmidt , the Dead professor , led the first semester program and speci@@ alis@@ es in American native and colonial history , &quot; said Don Allan Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas , and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday night , about 900 people attended the Delta State University in Cleveland in Cleveland , including teachers , collabor@@ ators , students and members of the community at a candle light commem@@ oration . &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Mr@@ s Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vig@@ il while the university door &quot; B@@ right Morning &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
classes are resumed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to return our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associated Press Auth@@ ors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to contradi@@ ct the fact that the police wrote after he had shot himself , and that the lamb had said in his emergency call to Pr@@ un@@ iss as his wife , but there is no indication of that the two were ever married . &quot;
Toys R Us is planning to hire less labour for Christmas season
&quot; toys R Us says that it will not be so many christmas season collabor@@ ators like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give up a chance to work with him and seasonal workers and seasonal workers to work more hours . &quot;

Michael J. Fox is enjoying his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was professionally designed for Michael J. Fox .
she was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat at the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I am sure that the seat is empty beside me , and it will be clear to me that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for the forth@@ coming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in mind that I am an sim@@ ulated grid and a arm length away from being a date with the prin@@ cess of Wales at a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , and with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; first premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; &quot; remains the greatest period of time that ever turned . &quot;
&quot; back in Time movie will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October . &quot;
&quot; UN leader says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; ban Ki @-@ moon says Secretary @-@ General , Secretary @-@ General , Ban Ki @-@ moon in reply to Russia , &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only be wor@@ sen@@ ed by millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader calls again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite ones@@ elf , and to support policies and integr@@ ative negotiations to the Fin@@ den of a political solution . &quot;
&quot; a press conference held on Wednesday that he plans to discuss the situation of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the insur@@ g@@ ations in the Council , and within the Syrian people and the regional powers can make this situation dis@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; ban claimed the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in the managing of the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated nuclear war with Iran . &quot;
8 revers@@ al values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is taking seriously .
some have tried to burn him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some of them wait for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper mar@@ ches in the p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work yet . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask seriously what it meant for the opportunities of the nomin@@ ation of real estate business . &quot;
&quot; of course , it &apos;s too soon in the election period . &quot;
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump probably will win the Republi@@ can nomin@@ ation .
&quot; experts acc@@ use that at that time , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership in the rise has been given to the rise of Herman Cain , none of which won only a state in the nom@@ inees process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but external sides such as Je@@ b Bus@@ hs Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to drop down its dollars to overthrow him .
&quot; here are some current survey values , which suggests that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not merely a temporary stage : &quot;
tr@@ um@@ ps popularity values have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate business Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
&quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot;
&quot; now , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early countries .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac tuning in Io@@ wa has found that 60 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P voters ( GO@@ P ) would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a CNN / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
only two of 10 say they would be &quot; up@@ set &quot; if he would be the candidate .
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages to say about the same passion as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent , they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about pregnancy ) . &quot;
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can elec@@ tors say they were &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favorite of the establishment , the candidate would . &quot;
a majority of the Republi@@ can sees Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive testimonies , 52 percent of those who have attempted to rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that the real estate company Mog@@ ul looks as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first dial state of the nation , the state of Io@@ wa , where the same 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a Commander in Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality in order to effectively implement his office , and almost six out of 10 are dependent on it that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t p@@ end to the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they apply their funds , Republi@@ can voters hold Tr@@ ump in real . &quot;
&quot; when asked who are asked who the most likely the GO@@ P nomin@@ ation wins , according to a CNN / OR@@ C survey from last week , four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four out of ten end of July their money was put to Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters had not the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry won the nomin@@ ation over just 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters will show a chat campaign as pl@@ au@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans gather around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is almost every one . &quot;
&quot; some experts as@@ sign that the frag@@ ile field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while the anti @-@ slip support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , stro@@ kes the multi @-@ ser@@ ene support . &quot;
&quot; he caught 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Cas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would out@@ run the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ in head .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans says that they have made their mind .
&quot; a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , who support Tr@@ ump , states that they have taken their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say , never change the opinion . &quot;
&quot; 46 per cent said they open the door open to change to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors they say they have made their mind , are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration , &quot;
&quot; since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign had called &quot; &quot; R@@ ape &quot; &quot; before two months ago , the Immig@@ ration and Angel@@ ica came into public dis@@ course in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic trig@@ gering of Tr@@ ump decisive Spanish @-@ Americans in the Republi@@ can party will be rest@@ rained from the Republi@@ can Party and damage the new ori@@ ent efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; as long as immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump is apparently to do too . &quot;
the fru@@ strations of the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son accounted for about half of the Republi@@ can elec@@ torate , especially by its out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than anyone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Io@@ wa in two weeks ago shows that three of four Io@@ wa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans are fru@@ str@@ ated among the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ happy &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the Five most exclusive residential districts in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive con@@ domin@@ ium - with a view over the North Sea ew@@ att .
&quot; in the street , a square meters of a double shelter stands at an average of 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; i.e. in the study , therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which special situations a square meter is most expensive . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top residential areas , the price is , however , such as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate Services Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German civil sites - with square met@@ ering prices in dizz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euros , per square meter , well noticed . &quot;
but good that can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is close to the top right here .
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
eight @-@ times tor@@ ment@@ ers in Pi@@ raeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
&quot; a happy match by Thomas Müller , the FC Bayern paved the way to a well deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then ran it . &quot;
a convincing start of the Champions @-@ League season .
&quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze launched a dream start in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan , &quot; by Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach ped@@ aling Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their opening game in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympics in the warm atmosphere thanks to Mül@@ lers double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Divine : 0 ( 0 ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola finally wants to run the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich . &quot;
&quot; Müller was given the help of the Champions League at his 28th place in the Champions League to take the help of the Olymp@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ al@@ berto , who suffered a sign of flan@@ k shot at the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate that , &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame settled in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 , and kept the Munich @-@ based speech . &quot;
&quot; they showed a concentrated , dedicated not@@ ion , without shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ raeus having won six young hom@@ eg@@ ades in the Royal Order , among them against renowned club as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) had stum@@ bled across here . &quot;
&quot; however , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , Bavaria is un@@ defeated , didn &apos;t want to be the next victims . &quot;
&quot; they cour@@ ageous , however , to inv@@ inci@@ ble efforts but often to inv@@ inci@@ ble efforts . &quot;
the attacks were often led by the link surface on the left outside Douglas Bal@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i used against the former brown @-@ welding Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right , when his f@@ lange broke out of the right half of the left @-@ right corner . &quot;
&quot; at the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms ide@@ ye brown the header of the Pol@@ es off the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
&quot; then , by direct withdrawal , the Tor@@ wart Roberto with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bavaria reg@@ ained their domin@@ ation , Pir@@ ating was allowed to sit i@@ fers . &quot;
on the door@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er was leaving .
&quot; like that , he placed a shot of ideas about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided to defend a four chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng . &quot;
&quot; Mario Go@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat initially without . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given a green light after the finishing exercise , &quot; said Sports management Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to do something different from it is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; in the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze was late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one step further . &quot;
it was in the stadium to Kra@@ v@@ all in front of the game .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly avoided , Bavaria fans in their viewers are apparently prov@@ oked the followers of hosts Pi@@ raeus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces seized and went against the Munich p@@ endants . &quot;
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; anyone smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who h@@ itting , makes it not only the lung , but also the teeth - that cat@@ ches a long @-@ term study near . &quot;
good news : with fung@@ us the risk falls quickly .
smokers should get a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is a long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smoking it was the risk of losing their teeth at the same time , in order to reduce the 2.@@ 5- up to 3.6 p@@ x . &quot;
scientists had watched over 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; cause of dental causes are c@@ aries and infections of gum disease , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphas@@ ize . &quot;
the link between smoking and tooth extraction would therefore go back to common gum disease in smokers .
&quot; if no clari@@ fication is , however , the risk of cav@@ ities also increases . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking by smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again to the level of non @-@ smoking , declared the first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; they had to convince people to convince people to avoid non @-@ smoking , explained study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking ett@@ les the lif@@ esp@@ an . &quot;
&quot; not smoking is good for lungs and vessels , and leads with our knowledge to a good dental health to the high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of age are affected by sl@@ iti@@ vity , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed . &quot;
previous studies have already noted that smoking ris@@ eth the risk of early ris@@ ings .
the new long @-@ term study character@@ ise the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the remn@@ ants of the late ancient
&quot; once again , archaeological finds have been seen on the right of Rhein@@ u@@ fer in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ le@@ vard , che@@ ologists from the Roman @-@ German@@ ischer museum exhibit skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said the museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; at all buildings in Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as an expert in the Archae@@ ological soil preser@@ vation . &quot;
the third construction stage of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were asked to find some .
&quot; of text documents have already been known that a fortress , and in the 8th century , got a church standing in the place and explained in Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remaining , the fortress and the church was also a cemetery with around 350 dit@@ ches , which was probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new trial in dispute over the TT@@ IP
&quot; for the resolution of the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;

&quot; the plans on the reform of the current arbit@@ ration procedure see specifically that the EU states and the USA , jointly , select an independent judge for a new investment issue . &quot;
&quot; they should come to the same parts of the EU , the USA , and third countries . &quot;
the second instance is also provided for the first time .
&quot; it would allow it to lift up objec@@ tion to judgments . &quot;
&quot; so far , the contra@@ ctors associated with refer@@ ees , a claim against their jud@@ gements exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that the citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in relation to fair@@ ness and justice did not commit to Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , she wants to work in an international investment plan according to their own data . &quot;
&quot; for example , the disp@@ utes between Chinese companies and the EU states could clari@@ fy there . &quot;
&quot; as one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP , mainly demanded by major corporations ( IS@@ DS ) . &quot;
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ers are crit@@ ici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , allowing for the damages of damage to tax@@ pay@@ ers to en@@ force national laws , or through a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in its first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act was in@@ adequate at the EU Commission &apos;s proposals as in@@ adequate . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is crit@@ ici@@ zed by the fact that they do not have to apply for foreign trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the German Economic State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described plans for the contrary . &quot;
&quot; to take into consideration the reform of essential points , the Federal Minister for the Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel established in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private Ar@@ bit@@ es is from the table .
the French government also greeted Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European company association business Europe warned against to limit the business opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; as a result , small and medium businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ ageous for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; when the discussions on free trade agreements , TT@@ IP ( Tran@@ sat@@ lan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , on Wednesday it remained un@@ clear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; the subject of investors protection was , however , not discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , an agreement should be signed at the end of this year . &quot;
that date is no longer viable .
iconic folk from Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens sits on stage in the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; in addition to him there is a fli@@ pchart that , on which the in@@ timi@@ dated folk Musi@@ cian has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan , with felt @-@ tip pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by Stev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he rel@@ ates from different places he has ever recorded on the map , which he will add to his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
&quot; where they arose , and looks like there , in his homeland . &quot;
since then Stev@@ ens has been creating as a wonder@@ fully creative mind .
&quot; published in 2003 and the third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : &quot; the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever , very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but at any time in the great opul@@ ent dri@@ fting . &quot;
&quot; it arises as a rum@@ our , &quot; Michigan , &quot; would be the first part of a series : each of the 50 US states that should be considered in a row . &quot;
but in 2004 and near the Rhine the &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; appeared and gives a positive certain expectations .
&quot; Stev@@ ens , Stev@@ ens reduced here . &quot;
live offers him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; a year later , the musician is returning to the series in New York . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens You To : Come on Fe@@ el The Crit@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece .
app@@ or@@ ating to ideas and sty@@ li@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of the most influential music media .
&quot; after most productive experiments , Stev@@ ens then rely on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic sales . &quot;
&quot; this sixth , ordinary studio album is still broad@@ ened , but carried by programmed sequences or beats , plays with every effect and hall . &quot;
&quot; long ago the smaller clubs were climbed , the stage of the stage were made with a colorful spectac@@ le made of Neon @-@ forehead and large flu@@ ffy dance . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan Stev@@ ens tou@@ red as part of a five @-@ member band through Germany .
the Hamburg Süd received more !
theatre is primarily devoted to the &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Lo@@ well &quot; site since March .
&quot; although almost 2000 guests have been banned in their chairs , the more mature Stev@@ ens return back to in@@ tim@@ acy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without being able to set up the audience , the group is currently playing excellent musicians through the wide @-@ enriched album . &quot;
from the audience you hear : the talk is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you could throw away the &quot; plate in the bottom . &quot;
&quot; just to an en@@ core , Stev@@ ens consume only a few older songs and is finally sho@@ cking out with thunder@@ ous appl@@ ause . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ ist debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister &quot;
&quot; since its election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ist has been eag@@ erly awaited by the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension &quot;
&quot; the new &quot; &quot; Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &quot; &quot; lawyer is supposed to give on his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ ing and promoted to David Cameron for the first time . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n won &apos;t collect the first of his six pre@@ defined questions shortly after noon , with his performance from the media probably and the Labour MEP from the vicinity is checked . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he has also said that he could ski@@ p several meetings to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s leadership , as she was named a member of the shadow of affairs and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
meanwhile the Labour Party &apos;s decision on Tuesday during the memorial commem@@ or@@ ating the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence had prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS and stands at the center of several fron@@ ts stories in the newspapers .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has caught attract attention . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had said &apos; in respect of silence , and he recognized the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ h Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told the BBC &apos;s CEO , told the Labour chairman , &quot; independent &quot; from his faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leading team , and they are called on differences in economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Parliamentary Party they supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Robin Bran@@ t polit@@ ician says that political differences may also be st@@ ack@@ able within Labour &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes must be removed to remove all the idea of limitation .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the Shadow of Labour and R@@ ents Minister said that the party is &quot; &quot; clearly &quot; &quot; to reduce the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n won the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory boss ever since , over the last decade of the Disp@@ atch Box in parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised another policies , says he has promised &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is held con@@ front@@ ational , and that it is under@@ going to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic minister urged him , if he is not participating , for example , if Mr. Cameron is on the road . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into the discussion that other colleagues occasionally seize the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le @-@ Theater &quot; which often has been associated with the leader of the Prime Minister . but some years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; as she was sent to television in 1990 , the question was regarded as the most important Bar@@ ometer of the Pr@@ ison and his leadership in the lower house and his position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed to have become a caric@@ ature and require further reforms . &quot;

this percentage had been the quick@@ est ever since 2009 and was ass@@ ess@@ ments above the time of interest .
the Po@@ unds rose by more than 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1.@@ 550@@ 5 and was climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the Euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
the F@@ T@@ SE 100 Index has an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding common stock market in the market and made a jump of 20 % after the take over the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; the transaction would combine the two biggest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world combine and produce brands such as Bud@@ get@@ own , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were supplem@@ ented by the Competition Group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.9 % higher .

Peg@@ i@@ da moti@@ ves in Lebanon on potato cro@@ wning idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
it is both - and in the potato be@@ ech@@ er that the Ol@@ den@@ burger owner owner Han@@ i Al@@ h@@ ay has developed .
&quot; inspired by the &quot; potato &quot; instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Peg@@ u@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance in television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop , a BBQ @-@ sk@@ e@@ wer that is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is a multi @-@ cult for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
Lebanese authorities have meanwhile taken an application at the Patent Office in Munich .
&quot; according to the authority , it has been protected as Consumer patterns . &quot;
&quot; how much flesh and how much potatoes of the spe@@ ar does , Al@@ h@@ ay doesn &apos;t want to betra@@ y Al@@ h@@ ay . &quot;
only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together . &quot;

Met@@ cash starts ground @-@ level campaign for fighting Al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
it is trying to protect IG@@ A branches off a Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food whol@@ es@@ aler Met@@ ers has launched a ground @-@ level campaign to defend the IG@@ A @-@ retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia as early as next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A supermarkets with local food suppliers and build the IG@@ A brand through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing over social media , as well as events like Adelaide @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A deal@@ er@@ ships and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as polar producers Hell@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , which is distributed in IG@@ A stores and sell shops for South Australian football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that there will be further details of his defense strategy on September 29 , when the whol@@ es@@ aler for food , alcohol and devices will be through its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A @-@ shop that generates and higher profit mar@@ gins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; shop@@ pers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial , and IG@@ A retail@@ er currently feature a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia as compared to about 14 percent in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts at Morgan Stanley believe that Al@@ di will take away some five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing actors , but primarily independent single @-@ handed sales . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stanley estimates that IG@@ A @-@ retailers can lose $ 360 million in revenues per year and met@@ a $ 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in next year , with a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; loss in the food and grocery store at Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost approximately 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the Eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A @-@ shop@@ pers are the most common . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley is assumed that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ p &apos;s sales in the food and grocery market growth of 3.8 percent in 2016 to 2.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 is expected to reduce its market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked with a business@@ man in Melbourne that Met@@ ers will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
it refused to respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ ers has been contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has decreased since 2010 by 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and food retailers , which has about 1,200 IG@@ A retail@@ er , has fallen by 43 percent , which reflected the operative debt reduction in relation to sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; the whol@@ es@@ aler plays however , investing more than $ 150 million in order to enhance sale prices with col@@ es and Wool@@ wor@@ ths about hundreds of products every week and IG@@ A retailers in improving their stores to improve fresh produce and provide a better choice of private @-@ label @-@ foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and store @-@ san@@ itation programs in Elan will get and hopes that the whol@@ es@@ al@@ ers will return to a profit in four years in 2017 .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis sites Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is ear@@ ns to praise praise for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; coll@@ ater@@ als &quot; &quot; in the shortest storm around his friend Nick C@@ aly and ear@@ ns according to the President of the Australian tennis player Steve He@@ aly worthy of criticism for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; co@@ king kin@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as a &quot; Special &quot; KS , &quot; ran into the spot of Montreal with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters in the spot@@ light . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y quali@@ fier in Cincinnati shortly afterwards , co@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be se@@ per@@ ated twice by the arbit@@ rators , where Harrison had cried out : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; when he was last seen how he crushed a tennis ra@@ cket , a fighting for an potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet was defended by He@@ aly was defended by He@@ aly , was defended . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is at present at Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup final in the UK . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I make me pretty much , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi was a little in the battle , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he broke one ra@@ cket while he lost because of a cr@@ amp@@ ant in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken up a bat with himself and I know Than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he really beha@@ ved very well in the US Open , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative conditions with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around ones@@ elf , and I think he was not treated a bit too strict . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 years old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players he &apos;s good in the form , he &apos;s a very stable and sophisticated young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own desires . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also made the decision to take C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision to take into account that begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; for all , but he secu@@ res the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long lasting strong part into the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not on all the con@@ tours around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe Nick has reached the ascension very quickly , what people like Feder@@ er and Murray have gone out . he is in the eyes of the public , but we try to make it comprehen@@ sible to him . some time outside the lim@@ el@@ ight , which he can only think about it , and it is best for the team , and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains Not@@ ice , closes the border , keeps refugees back &quot;
Hungary declared the emergency number and locked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and kept everyone who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . everything related to the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials .
&quot; people who fled from violence , were stuck for an unknown period in a land Stri@@ ps on the road between the two control points of the countries , and settled down there . &quot;
but Fru@@ it grew .
&quot; as a police helicopter over them sli@@ d , the migrants &apos; authorities opened the border ! &quot; and cried out ins@@ ults towards the Hungarian power police . &quot;
some mar@@ es back from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants coming back from Hungary , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) does not want to harm a part of the solution and does not harm a coll@@ ater@@ als .
&quot; in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serb border reached a day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ old block at a controversial meeting in Brussels won &apos;t agree joint immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who had taken refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or until the end of the year - an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the migration crisis in the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , its hopes are not put into a bal@@ m action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities blocked more auth@@ orization to protect the crisis so that they were able to exp@@ ung@@ ers roads and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire rope along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after it has ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison bonds were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in the past few months , Hungary became a significant number of war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East to a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and an input point in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban passed that the majority of the coming economic refugees are seeking protection after a better life , and not war refugees , which are strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed around midnight into Hungary , crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us , who left the government along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also put higher terms of damage to human traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the situation , which is ar@@ ising from mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs rep@@ orters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : an illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must not agree on the use of the military even to the use of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters from Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs . &quot;

election 2016 : Hillary Clinton leads straight ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
&quot; former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to keep a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins ground against the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now backed 47 percent of democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced he will receive the presidential elec@@ torate , receives its support of 15 percent of democratic voters . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates are supporting them . &quot;
but Clinton Supp@@ orters are in their choice more resistant than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton had lost some gains during a series of demo@@ graphic groups while S@@ anders recorded some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton keeps a wide lead on women and the temper@@ ate , but these pre@@ fers have reduced . &quot;
&quot; your support with the men has been pl@@ ung@@ ed significantly , and S@@ anders are only with 5 points behind . &quot;
&quot; Clinton takes advantage of democratic voters under the age of 50 , and she and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a huge advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton stood before S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead over the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now got a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of democratic voters in the nationwide elections say that they would help Clinton , if they were nominated by the party . &quot;
one quarter would support them with some reserved and 15 percent would only support them because she is the can@@ did@@ acy .
it would not support six percent .
perhaps Clin@@ tons &apos;s actual supporters are excited about it enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who are unable to support Clinton - only about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters say that they were helping to support Clinton with enthusiasm , fewer Republi@@ can voters say that their peak wage Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton Supp@@ orters are asked in an open question , why they want it to be the can@@ did@@ acy , is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by a woman president ( 13 per cent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
by Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters a connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned .
approval for dealing with problems and voters are also cited .
&quot; since the vice president thro@@ ws a potential for the presidency in the scales , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - even though a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the presidential elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is on top . &quot;
from Clin@@ tons &apos;s supporters say more than half that bi@@ den would be far ahead of their second election .
&quot; biolog@@ ically trying to solve the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton receives an advantage ahead of S@@ anders , of 20 points with Bi@@ den in competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters think Clinton in can@@ did@@ acy with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that considers him as the &quot; &quot; choice &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what an important candidate is more important , Democratic elec@@ torate has asked questions concerning voters . &quot;
similarly as in the last month no single Democrats elec@@ torate or potential candidate for these voters are un@@ acceptable for these voters .
&quot; the Democratic candidate , or potential candidate cho@@ oses good results with some important features in voters for the presidential election . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and equipped with strong guide qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den cuts best in hon@@ esty when Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is in the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty per cent of democratic voters don &apos;t believe Clinton &apos;s honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; Democratic Vot@@ ers in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; to ask Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the period of office , majority of the Democratic elec@@ tors are satisfied with their statement of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their statement , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion was in March , shortly after the trouble of the light was split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ mail account had no impact on their general Opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion is still wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; mainly Republi@@ can , more than six out of 10 , are saying that Clinton &apos;s views are worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , it is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent do they see as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than in the last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those entitled to vote are not entitled to an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the voting rights are far too honest and un@@ tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , get good notes on guidance . &quot;
&quot; out of the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son , and Bush are best in hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority looks very honest , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have any opinion from him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Polish voters in the preliminary p@@ olls is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer survey to Donald Tr@@ ump in Poland
Ben Car@@ son is situated close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times .
&quot; in the meantime , half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l , and others lose rather dramatically , fall dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can elec@@ torate so far continues Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS pol@@ l , which was conducted over the Fox News debate last month , to 27 % in the survey of Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son passes well at demo@@ graphic groups and sur@@ passed resistance among Republi@@ can elec@@ torate with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ ich , is beaten by Wis@@ con@@ sins Governor Scott Walker , who fell at the bottom , and from 10 % support in the final month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida Governor , Je@@ b Bush , former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ing@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio there are 6 % in third place . &quot;
the error margin for the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can elec@@ torate in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son raises in the surveys - he gains in 19 % support among rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the slip with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tr@@ ump clear ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; at a glance at the Car@@ son &apos;s last week , Tr@@ ump found some side hi@@ ves for former Neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son committed himself to question inde@@ b@@ ted belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on Saturday , during a campaign of campaigns in Io@@ wa . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood have been bur@@ dened by the death of a Bar@@ uch College @-@ Ne@@ ul@@ ings
&quot; nearly two years after a student in a sch@@ ik@@ an@@ ous ritu@@ als of a student @-@ union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , recru@@ itment for five persons is filed . &quot;
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood captured Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during one of the introduc@@ tory ritu@@ als in September 2013 and delayed his transfer into the hospital which contributed to his death .
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack , loaded with sand and repe@@ ats over@@ h@@ aul , while trying to step towards a frozen field on a planet . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , and he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
&quot; members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was rewarded and were supposed to be an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to contact his symptoms on goo@@ gle , and Andy Men@@ g to bring the national president of the Brotherhood to bring advice , said Police Sek@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of the utensils began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood in principle over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died on the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; according to an aut@@ op@@ ilot , Den@@ g was repeated with a silent force of injuries to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the sc@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies every year since 1970 to the Sch@@ ik@@ ans , &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be drawn to account , and this step of authorities is very important . &quot;
&quot; a County Grand Jury of Monroe admitted , for murder , third @-@ degree case for the first five members . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of victims of religious attacks and a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to do the responsible persons , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this has been restored , so we will also draw this to the account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College had banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked her affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; a interest rate comes , and the bar@@ se will fall into the Wan@@ ted , yields top yields , and the economy will slip into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last , and how long will it be . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the story for the economy is only small guide to the exp@@ ir@@ ation . &quot;
a recession appears within only 11 months following the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at raising the interest rate is often , if not always , a factor will react , like the economy and financial systems . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Bank so strongly insi@@ sted that investors should not concentrate on what it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants could however determine that the whole excitement was possibly excessive due to interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we expect the gradu@@ al return of the U.S. interest to normal high places , but still on a low level to have a seis@@ mic shock to lead many . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there is no impact . &quot;
here is a historical trend @-@ based look at how some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as seen in the market last month , the presence of interest rates can make matters for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase in elevation , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency to c@@ rou@@ d assets 12 to 24 months after initial increase , which is perhaps reflected in the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German bank analysts in a newer trial , what happens after interest rates of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate , fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return on average of 14.@@ 4 percent , with an average return on Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ds to occur later in the increasing cycle and the return on equity begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest rates promote them often . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some terms which could not exist before and accelerate the recession . &quot;
&quot; most notable is that the gross domestic product will be in the proximity of its lowest point , with a interest rate of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 r@@ amp@@ al threats have only been the nominal GDP for 4.5 percent since 1950 . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent , we expect that this will last only to reach 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the estimates of the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest rates at such frag@@ ile economic background could be ris@@ ky and t@@ oss the question , &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year on a Zin@@ ser@@ ene of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were addressed to the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could be an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all increases cycles carried out from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing vibration at GDP , and on before rec@@ ession@@ ists mo@@ wed very quickly after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a unique recovery of what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which has been waiting for the F@@ ed since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also volatile , since the market takes a zinc threat , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in shares if they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , returns appear to change the direction once the first increase / drop in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increase cycle , the others fall immediately , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; Charles Schw@@ ab &apos;s strateg@@ ist believe that the increase in the rates of interest will result in that , for longer and shorter bonds , yields close to a curve . &quot;
&quot; in such a climate , highly @-@ interest bonds often bring better yields , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; what is interesting is , Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospec@@ t of stri@@ cter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the amount curve is fl@@ atter , credit lines have increased , and the vol@@ atility has increased - all the market &apos;s characteristics when the F@@ ed is intensi@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , businesses that wrap the greater part of their business activity in the USA , will benefit if interest rates rise and attractive local products . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are worse d@@ ast@@ ly , because an increasing dollar is more expensive on the global market , and as well as financing its debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; Quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive for three months following an initial interest rate , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs analysts in a report for customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet , companies with a weak balance of all the interest rates in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 exceeded the average of 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital gains as well as low vol@@ atility in their shares have also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts are a major problem .
&quot; with a high proportion of flexible interest rates , most of them will lose , Gold@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock @-@ games , consumers are also benef@@ iting from increasing costs . &quot;
&quot; spar@@ es could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are in different opinion , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the con@@ doms member of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster due to his &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
he argu@@ ed that he is not to discri@@ min@@ ate from commercial rival .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they only benef@@ ited The Br@@ its
Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Collins attacked the show The Voice and said that this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; &quot; Classic FM &quot; &quot; claims a leader of parliament and raise new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does not do something the private broad@@ caster . &quot;
&quot; con@@ serv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham said also to the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; susp@@ ects &quot; and increasingly do not differ from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; susp@@ ect &quot; - but it seems to turn up to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something different - these are two spontan@@ e@@ ously mentioned examples , in which you actually only know what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director proved the accus@@ ations back and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of its commercial competitors , when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I don &apos;t like to learn about classic music anywhere else . &quot;
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that really is uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 , new music , and new works on behalf I really keep it for important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder it needs to engage with the audience as it did in the past , because the British had kept less than classic music . &quot;
&quot; however , radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production , which , during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport that fell under fire to tr@@ ample the commercial rival to its feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Collins handle The Voice to - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - &quot; was produced at a special BBC @-@ way . &quot;
&quot; he added that he would like to find the company &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; when it was the next time an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclu@@ de the order from the voice of The Voice in the future or to spend money in the fee for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales in August on the slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , the lowest result since the start of records began in 2000 . &quot;
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones to purchase
experts believe that the Black Friday has hin@@ dered the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping streets has been dr@@ illed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into cov@@ et@@ ous cities . &quot;
&quot; but experts say there is no evidence that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest in growth in growth since the start of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are indications that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back until 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian , has always developed over the course of time . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales rose three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; now , this comm@@ utes lies , and we are likely to see the growth dimin@@ ished . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for decl@@ ining sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will maintain their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computer to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealer websites over@@ threw . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , who could sl@@ ay the buyer for bar@@ gain , could carry out buyers . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium find out that a £ 5 cash issues were printed online .
some products such as TV and washing machines are now carried out more than one @-@ third of our purchases via web @-@ shops .
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people buying clothing and shoes online instead of fashion cities in the cities of cities . &quot;
Muslims : buried in Mec@@ ca for the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tion@@ ed
&quot; the bodies of 29 dead are transported by Muslims in the first m@@ tr@@ ons in Mec@@ ca , by the streets &quot;
Saudi Arabia dis@@ covers the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden .
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that altogether , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims gathered , when 29 of the victims were borne by the streets to bury those who were killed , as a crane collapsed on the Mek@@ kas . &quot;
&quot; filled in white , filled mostly in white , the way to z@@ ure their respect , when the first of the dead emerge their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession was passed along the Holy site , where only days a tree ran through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the operator top@@ pled . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were approved for the funeral , when the Saudi King passed over the construction company of the Bin Laden &apos;s building because of the catastrophe that caused 3@@ 94 leaving behind a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 operators , which were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central mosque in Mec@@ ca , were carried by the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , was father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage to the crane collapsed . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram used his parents at the beginning of the annual rush in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi &apos;s officials have already been ple@@ dged that the add@@ ons come to Mec@@ ca with thousands , which continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today king Sal@@ man , the bin Laden group had not said to have had the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency , said the bin Laden is responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency , in English speaking of the news agency , told this detail , said that leadership of the company abroad should be forbidden . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man revealed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the mag@@ ca@@ des , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims occur earlier this month . &quot;
&quot; the bin Laden has not published any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree was also reflected in the group due to non @-@ current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes in Mec@@ ca sur@@ round Mec@@ ca car@@ c@@ ee as part of the massive building project initiated by the Bin Laden .
&quot; for decades , the family bin Laden is connected to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia and holds up more building projects . &quot;
&quot; the late Al Qaeda leader , Osama bin Laden , was a Ab@@ revol@@ t son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash occurred in the middle of heavy wind and rain , just a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is at least once in the life of each healthy player . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
&quot; government officials believe that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ ,000 ) are paid to the families of those killed and the same sum in the permanent aband@@ on@@ ement . &quot;
other injured people get half this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss is telling that the time of the cheap Eastern European art@@ is@@ ans is over
&quot; British employed more skilled workers , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of qualified crafts@@ man from eastern Europe has a rise behind him
&quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen , are opened . &quot;
simultaneously King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide close
&quot; Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail News &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that Brit@@ ons carry their H@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European tra@@ des@@ people who carry out work in their home , &quot;
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush on the drawing of walls , you seem to be a minority now . &quot;
&quot; because Br@@ its become increasingly skilled workers to perform DIY jobs in their homes , so the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new manager of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Baum@@ gart@@ ner chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified people from Eastern Europe who offer services to low prices are now out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , King@@ fis@@ her has to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that addressed a tra@@ des@@ man and closing 60 sales points from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men ceased the men . &quot;
&quot; she said , it is necessary to imagine the growing demo@@ graphic trends which have more than female single @-@ households , which are more honour@@ able than in the past . &quot;
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; generally , half of our clients choose women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a great role in deci@@ ding process .
&quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed at the head of a British in F@@ T@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also stri@@ pped their top team to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has occupied some 50 per cent of the team with women including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is an important topic here .
it wasn &apos;t difficult to find good women for our board .
King@@ F@@ isher gave a decline in half @-@ year earnings and re@@ counts after the group ow@@ es the costs for the closing of the shops .
&quot; because of the trend King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
officials from a@@ I / D@@ if due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the regional court Kl@@ agen@@ furt on Wednesday two officials from Austria &apos;s volleyball group a@@ I / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and par@@ tak@@ ings .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse .
on this accus@@ ation he was acquitted of force in May .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , Robert Ri@@ ffel was cryst@@ alli@@ zed out , that the def@@ endants were used from associations in 2006 to 2011 , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage has been donated to approximately 400,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also accused of financial transactions .
&quot; this fact , the President of the Ch@@ op@@ ener Council , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in , retired . &quot;
a later date is to be negotiated .
&quot; for lack of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence suggests that the association was not a certain asset at any time . &quot;
&quot; Sports work had only been reduced for lack of damage and the sports club for which they have been working from 1982 to 2011 and invested some 600,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approximately 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; then we stood in front of the situation : do we conduct the club further , or did we wait ? &quot; &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in the Bre@@ ad @-@ based meetings of the financial year . &quot;
he then decided to take this job with his co @-@ def@@ endants with his co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have shot money , our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the redemption . &quot;
&quot; agreed with the association : you can manage the money , it is not permitted to have any debts . &quot;
down@@ ers is - with appropriate financial success the withdrawal of financial damages had been dra@@ ining until 1991 .
&quot; therefore , I have a part of the lack of expenses for years later that as of the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account had been paid out . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump @-@ form@@ - and not detailed tex@@ tures seemed , the former Ob@@ server explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the two def@@ endants , the other def@@ endants , were accused of all the def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
why the out@@ flow of the association were not detailed in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association is not interested in detail for financial situation , it was important to pay the cancellation of the debt . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , as in 2011 , investigations against the officials of the committee began in 2011 , a total amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association . &quot;
&quot; the were returned , the def@@ endants pleaded . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known according to the association .
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
the guard did not ask for a long time .
&quot; finally , he thought he thought that it was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one knew something of that money , the prosecutor asked in the room . &quot;
the Mit@@ er had been informed to be informed of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; claims of damage . &quot;
&quot; why is damage to damage ? , judge judge and state prosecutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association did not develop a damage . &quot;
&quot; what can I do when the lawyer says , &quot; You are all from the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a deputy ? &quot; he asked .
&quot; moreover , the function@@ ary said he has never covered a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates only o@@ dd@@ ling and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; he then charged 1.000 Euro per month to di@@ ets , but the actual expend@@ itu@@ res have been much higher , but he added . &quot;
accurate documents for the early years did not affect the accused .
&quot; these are after an examination , in which everything has been judged correctly , no longer been kept , declared . &quot;
kilometers did also pay repar@@ ations against the second accused .
&quot; all dom@@ ic@@ ations are made in cash , with this he had to leave from his home base to the Bank to Blei@@ k , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will be continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard offers more than 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the current recru@@ itment of staff , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese , which has been running since three years , is expanding further jobs . &quot;
positions at the U.S. @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) will not find an end to the customer .
&quot; as part of its re@@ organisation , the US technology group plans to disman@@ tle the reduction of 25.000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer position . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company shared on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will result in a special load of about EUR 2.7 billion , which will rise from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs during three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; as at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP were still around 30,000 employees . &quot;
&quot; on the stock market , Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ stock was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the large group of California , Palo Alto , is currently divided into : thus , the computer and printing shop will be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the advanced areas of computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be recorded at the stock exchange .
&quot; a further dis@@ appointing PC sales , as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers , following its services , included the world &apos;s second largest PC producer . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of the quarter of July , sales of PC and print declined by 11.5 per cent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds were returned to 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds to a folding and massive position of positions on the transformation in the industry .
&quot; the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man , only re@@ acts strongly that customers can buy smartphones and tablets instead of ordinary computers and do more and work online . &quot;
&quot; in total , Whit@@ mans re@@ organisation plans to see a total reduction of around 5@@ 5.000 positions . &quot;
conflict : majority support the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting host@@ ilities in Iraq , however , would mainly stum@@ ble with re@@ jection : 54 per cent said against it , 35 per cent showed themselves . &quot;
&quot; if other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent found positive . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , 24 percent are to interv@@ ene in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; together with the Syrian government , Bashar al @-@ Assad with@@ holds 51 percent of the respondents , 20 percent would be charged . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : non @-@ break@@ age of Serbian @-@ Hungarian borders
the Hungarian police deployed on the Serbian Border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Water@@ designers against several hundred re@@ im@@ min@@ ted refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the break of violence at the border controls .
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees cap@@ tiv@@ ated the border .
behind it a polic@@ eman sho@@ cked up and behind the polic@@ emen prepared a water@@ pot .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw together with stones , sticks and plastic bottles for the officials . &quot;
the officials were initially dis@@ continuous pep@@ per@@ mint .
the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as .
much Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as has been spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the group was thus dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn himself waiting for a waiting time .
an pregnant and apparently injured wife was taken away from the zone .

time of Dec@@ ision about interest rates for the US bank@@ note bank
&quot; the world is ob@@ serving if the U.S. rating bank will come together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time almost a decade the interest will be raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists who were questioned by Reuters , found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will continue to wait until now and the interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will hold . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest rates to NU@@ LL since . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and starts a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
the U.S. economy is based on a relatively good performance level ; trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate just a low inflation .
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less@@ ening outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to meet an increase , but the signs indicate that the opportunities are good against such a step . &quot;
&quot; the decision to be announced at 20.00 , CET on Thursday will be announced &quot;
deaths on the Delta State University left debt
&quot; after shooting and killing his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he stab@@ bed his colleague , stab@@ bed a note that he wanted &quot; mercy &quot; for the first murder , and wanted to &quot; &quot; do it dry &quot; , &quot; authorities opened on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said he was shot on someone , and someone put to death . &quot;
&quot; lamb said to the staff of the emergency call , that the police have sent polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night , and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , but nobody distur@@ b &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the hunt for his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police captured the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to do it backward . &quot;
I loved Amy and she &apos;s the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , there was 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , killing him before being transferred his own life on Monday evening when police attacked him . &quot;
&quot; Universal President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything from a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that pr@@ er@@ iss had a relationship with Schmidt , on Tuesday , authorities on Tuesday , there is no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en was heard from Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was about seven years old when a &quot; good man &quot; was written . &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss had a daughter who is 19 , and it was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ un@@ iss had her daughter &quot; absolutely the best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ un@@ iss worked online from home , according to the testimony of Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , which was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ un@@ iss at Sun Her@@ ald . &quot;
Kno@@ w@@ les said that fear@@ ful that had a dog named Light@@ ning has met for approximately three years with Lamb .
&quot; she always wanted to help others , &quot; &quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said , &quot;
&quot; the police said that lamb was called kind@@ led at a certain point of time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he was not in prison . &quot;
&quot; police officer got him on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville in that night , he crossed his car to the side , fled to the forest , ran into the forest , killing themselves with a shot . &quot;
&quot; lamb received a PhD from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , as evi@@ den@@ ced from the university &apos;s website . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a big brand building .
&quot; in the year , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the roughly 1,000 executives around the world will cost the company &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot , there is new negotiations . &quot;

&quot; with the goal of real@@ ignment is a result of earnings of around € 500 million a year of cost and earnings sy@@ ner@@ gies , the airline divided the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no longer a member of the passengers for passenger business in the future . &quot;
Euro@@ wings will be scheduled to be able to become as independent as possible .
&quot; in the board of the Board of Directors , Carsten Spo@@ hr will continue to be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;

Luke Shaw of Manchester United cannot play for double Fra@@ ktur for months
&quot; at the Champions @-@ League defeat of Manchester , Luke Shaw held a double Fra@@ ktur of his right B@@ one at the PS@@ V Eindhoven in Eindhoven . &quot;
&quot; while they brought to the left hand def@@ ender to the left and closing him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give up hope that Shaw can again play in this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year @-@ old Shaw was broken in the PS@@ V area .
he was treated in the playing field for nine minutes before being taken to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg fre@@ cture and is situated in the hospital .
tomorrow he will be moved tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy that comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the dressing cabin he had a oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double cargo , then it takes six months and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and the hanging of a river El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola R@@ izz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ rators had er@@ red .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a penalty @-@ meter and a red card had been due . &quot;
it was a very bad assault with both legs .
&quot; Twe@@ et upon Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can &apos;t describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back again . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw about the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; the England Defender has an additional inc@@ entive for the European Championship , hoping to recover up to the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about that . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to off@@ end one enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know what feels like it , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - following a flight match by Chris Sm@@ alling .
and you know David Cameron and Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s a thing to learn all of the parents : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
&quot; you might be David Cameron , too . &quot;
&quot; as he asked by a supplier of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which took place in 1971 , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and goes on : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my kids , because it always seems to have a picture or message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything is nice and well , except that the following paragraph describes the story of the book in which Cameron is supposed to re @-@ publish a content of the 2012 film version , which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the w@@ alled city Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , re@@ alising the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to meet a real tree , was reading . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was read and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this would still be not susp@@ icious enough : the text of Cameron described in part is how the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is un@@ artificial and even the air will be a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron triggered the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the cov@@ eted Lor@@ ax , a hol@@ low , car@@ ving creatures , &quot; &quot; that is spoken in the name of the trees , &quot; &quot; is devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that The Lor@@ ax had not read 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text was probably come by Cam@@ er@@ ons election office .
&quot; Super Camp confirmed that the text of Cam@@ er@@ ons employees was delivered , but there was no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was threatened by the German team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , a difficult task , but when you &apos;ve selected the Ka@@ es who has selected England for the Tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series is not on my map . &quot;
I would not finish a down@@ wards victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the common spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t carry sc@@ ars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive approach . &quot;
&quot; having the ball , Mo@@ grab@@ Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test plane is an option for the attack . &quot;
here related message : Adam Ly@@ th de@@ parts from the England @-@ test Ka@@ es and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course , working for me as chief manager in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks in difficult conditions , and simple but harsh reality is that thr@@ illing players are al@@ igned with results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question@@ er at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , since - and I said this - player their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control over his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; if he offers hopefully further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss concluded his post@@ ure , even if he did not bring so good achievements , and this is not surprised ; he &apos;s mainly a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time gets a test b@@ ats@@ man to put his character , is difficult . &quot;
Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son ahead of him - while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on got nine .
only Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and down@@ wards .
the only accus@@ ation that you can lift was that England first used Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales is coming in , and he is a bu@@ zz@@ mann , whom I set high . &quot;
&quot; it is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he took home 236 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends of course on the team &apos;s team in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat the Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would receive an extra spin @-@ in and four qu@@ icks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a bu@@ zz@@ mann cannot hit there ; and this left hand has already shown that he is a Teu@@ fel@@ sk@@ ew of Cri@@ cket tournaments .
&quot; Mo@@ een is perhaps not done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is it a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate Justin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred inst@@ ances immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari arrives in the squ@@ ad as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited approach with him he has very impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff and 35 with the ball - and think , it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that hang their hands and trainer have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; in addition to the crew , England has made some smart supplements on the train@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ anch@@ oly , the son of Sri Lanka , became a master in Sri Lanka as a consultant for the test games . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the most cour@@ ageous fel@@ lows of the game , which will bring a lot of experience as he played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes into the white sphere of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has int@@ entions , of which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can be offered in the dressing cabin , even if the messages are in line with the previously said . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ dy &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , was not used at the one @-@ day , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but counter and team manufacturers don &apos;t determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that their jobs depend on results .
such decisions are not made light heart@@ y .
&quot; the Bre@@ xit @-@ Camp ( Bre@@ xit = Break@@ ing Great Britain from the EU ) could win as a result , if the economy will be in a Fl@@ au@@ te force by 2017 . &quot;

&quot; Prime Minister and Finance ministers climb on the summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capit@@ als , take a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , coming home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it always takes me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes once outside Britain in the interior of the EU , &quot; L@@ ess us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ headed ministers and officials from some capit@@ als have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we are or going . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to aband@@ on the office before it looks very po@@ or@@ ly for her like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande can look at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a flo@@ wery power .
&quot; Poland may soon be a nation@@ alistic government , Spain one left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better for it , Scotland separ@@ ating from the UK - something they did not want to do because most of the similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies . &quot;
&quot; hence , some such ministers may not intenti@@ onally depri@@ ve some of such ministers in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s Speaker campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the re @-@ trial was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing out of new negoti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how rac@@ tical the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press bar@@ ons as they did not know during the 1975 Tony Ben@@ n Benef@@ it refer@@ end@@ ums to our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; need@@ less to remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ Euro Opp@@ ortun@@ ity , who made a name for itself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all its resi@@ den@@ ies , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ prin@@ cess @-@ ch@@ ur@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ itting foreigners and p@@ seudo non @-@ domestic countries that most of our large newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air said similar to her , but turned out that if one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you can better ban@@ anas describe it , rather than going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bl@@ ai@@ ri@@ ans as Bl@@ air himself , when he had opposed to Cam@@ er@@ ons train@@ ee , because Bl@@ air had denied the principle of the non @-@ adopted Constitution of the EU , which was then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 to bring him a back@@ door . &quot;
the press has never been forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly little liqu@@ or on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he couldn &apos;t need any time for me - seems in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ ting Mur@@ ders strategy of the 80 @-@ year old , a mistake at that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa on Sunday has left . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s official position to Europe - I just press it out - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps are traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ material trend and the wild ass of Tor@@ y Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can be said to that . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n in the radio and on television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs fought in it , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ist &apos;s appointment as a Sch@@ att@@ endant possessed a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it remin@@ ded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old when his old father worked on TV because his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going far too far and to loose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ara &apos;s struggle was still more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , &quot; to remain under all circumstances - &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , and what J@@ C told his co @-@ meeting and members after all reports on their claim@@ er on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the new bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to conv@@ ey , remember that he even touched me - News @-@ discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the Stru@@ del of Social Media , a breeding station of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to maintain labels in the refer@@ end@@ anger for a self @-@ understand@@ able , as Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ l are fundamental am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to the EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion of le@@ ft@@ ist dis@@ sent@@ ers , for which the Nar@@ c@@ isation of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic str@@ ut@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; as with its am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ fish is convinced that J@@ C launches no campaign in the outlet , will attempt to find foreign diplom@@ ats in all to find a sense of their su@@ peri@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin approach political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the U.S. has already quite disappointed of the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power where I was remin@@ ded of something that was called British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health England report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that E @-@ cigarettes are less harmful to smoking than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by crit@@ ici@@ zing the public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes in their report . &quot;
P@@ he published the &quot; Manifest@@ ation Report &quot; last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have put on the load capacity of the data and referred to the connections between several experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month brought the &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ated basis &quot; based on the basis of his most important conclusions .
&quot; two more researchers write to BM@@ J and asked whether these claims are &quot; &quot; based on stone and sand . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies are based on efficacy of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that &quot; the current best estimate is that E @-@ cigarettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of references and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were invited to develop a model for multiple criteria of decision analysis ( Multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) to lead their opinions on the damages of various nic@@ ot@@ ine @-@ containing products ; the results of the meeting were combined in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting called Euro@@ Swiss Health was to have received its managing director of British American Tob@@ acco funds ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T in public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated in the meeting stated funding from an e @-@ cigarettes , but not the financing he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to be added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the Gre@@ ens are not supplied , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champ@@ ions , some of which also include a range of activity in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how at the tobacco monitoring .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was attended by P@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research fellowship of the Group &quot; conf@@ esses that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for damages of most products at most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , no such links or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that E @-@ cigarettes are as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J has already responded to the claims . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful as smoking . &quot;
every second li@@ fel@@ ess child dies at his suff@@ ice .
&quot; all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has unique duty to the information of the public about what the evidence shows , and what does not , especially if there are as much public confusion about relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80,000 people die annually in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system $ 2 billion a year . &quot;
&quot; clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking by smoking is present , we carry out our national competence . &quot;
&quot; BBC should quit East@@ En@@ ders , says the former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival would give up their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent through other UK channels .
&quot; he critic@@ ised the BBC for the fact that they publicly displayed publicly @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial current windows against the most popular shows of their rival and sen@@ ders such as BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to come into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes in order sends , or sends , also clearly shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication committee within the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to hold the radio fee , which I do not want to hold for a good idea or at the long term , one should not do its production at least on programs that others do not make or commissioned . &quot;
they send the Voice to a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a possible support for their future as possible .
&quot; the idea that nobody would demonstrate this is a joke , it &apos;s ridicul@@ ous , it is natural non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed , which may also be financed without subsidi@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions . &quot;
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public @-@ protected television .
I don &apos;t think that this was going to decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s fault to reviews is &quot; due to the amb@@ itions of people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments among the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC enter the back , which was the former ladder by Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ na lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that they should not measure the rather publicly @-@ legal N@@ ative programs &quot; to BB@@ C4 , &quot; but they can not measure their tasks , and they can argue that if they have created all these ob@@ tru@@ sive programs , which no one has seen all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the Committee , &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather rainy system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think we &apos;re thinking that you get a great value for £ 150 per year here , but for people who , for the 150 £ a lot of money , wonder if that &apos;s true , because they consume not much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , asked that the BBC asked their Rei@@ th@@ ian @-@ Mission to inform and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from the BBC production would now be classified as education . he said that it should be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take up to the public @-@ legal TV channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform and maintain . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television will be displayed , and with the commercial broad@@ caster Alli@@ ances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ homogen@@ e@@ Genetics &apos; can control bra@@ ces by sound waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they will pun@@ ish with sound impul@@ ses . &quot;
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerv@@ v@@ systems and can be controlled by the bore of sound@@ waves .
&quot; the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they have so@@ unding with sound impul@@ ses , which have to be listened to high frequencies for the human hearing . &quot;
the impul@@ ses operate due to switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels that are respon@@ ding to ultr@@ asonic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ ogen@@ e@@ Genetics , where ultr@@ asound can be used in order to activate a series of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian , that the procedure could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive method , which gives electric impul@@ ses to the brain of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; failure in general do not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , intensi@@ fy the ultr@@ asound waves , which are penet@@ rate the worms . &quot;
the reinforced ultr@@ asound waves on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and can be found in membran@@ es of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves carry the opening of these icons and activate the cells , which they are assigned to such a report in Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of their Mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels can be worn . &quot;
&quot; if it turns ultr@@ asound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ blo@@ wer and transm@@ itting them to the worms , where they change the changed Mot@@ on@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the process has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to input and eliminate neur@@ ons with imp@@ ul@@ ses of light . &quot;
&quot; but Chal@@ as@@ ani said , that Son@@ o@@ e@@ Genetics could have some advantages over this technology . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the brain at an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultr@@ asound ultr@@ asound ultr@@ asound tissue can pass in@@ correctly , so the brain can be sent from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gen@@ otherapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily hal@@ ve the target human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neurolog@@ ical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ productive cells , added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , I went to a student residence at the student residence at Ber@@ ets and moral re@@ vis@@ itation , but only now I remember the ten@@ sion@@ ed smile of those who I had anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lang@@ at@@ ford compl@@ aining about others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I &apos;ve learned , the most simple rules can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules . &quot;
the entrance into a student residence is easy to sc@@ ary up to an absolute sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to be wat@@ ered : people tell whence you come from , if you come to Cor@@ by@@ n , and why you have hon@@ estly say Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - make questions and show your interest .
&quot; it grants us the conversation and helps you to find out the people who would like to do contrary to those whom you would not speak , even if your eyelashes would swal@@ low in the fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave you .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into drinks , film night venues and municipal gath@@ er@@ ings , but they are also the places where people put on clothing and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; referring to this : do not remember , to start with a relationship with a relationship &quot;
Intro@@ duc@@ es receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many students inhab@@ it form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and soci@@ ally and can lead to life @-@ friendly friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say , &quot; &quot; I like you , and I want go on our friendship , but you have to go away so that I get the energy back that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a susp@@ ect is exhausted from soci@@ alizing , and send SMS instead of an SMS instead . &quot;
speaking of ank@@ le teeth : do you do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that an un@@ decided door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship exclu@@ de by baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the height of back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ister is on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have some baked to you . so , and now please smile , when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friends .
your ro@@ omm@@ ate feels obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will probably associate your face with a le@@ ak surprise at the end .
of course it depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly missing cl@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat make that people sleep sleeping , if you get ank@@ le . &quot;
steal food is an or@@ derly crime in student residence .
&quot; naturally , the cl@@ a@@ ws of chicken is a theft , but it is that of a drop of Mil@@ k for your tea too ? &quot;
check it with the dairy owner .
&quot; the opportunities stand well , they say , themselves , even when they are inside . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , it is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to get balanced than my fellow worker who added a j@@ etting to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; you should do no noise , keeping people out of sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about trying to be a permanent man , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the prover@@ b to the people who sit in the glass ash@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor would ask her neighbours , if there is something to do them , drum &amp; bass set something more quiet , because it had at least three o &apos;clock in the morning , and it had a test in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it with even more noisy music .
&quot; when they stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours were kindly allowed to sleep two hours before she left her own music , and went to her three @-@ hour test . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future wife would randomly put into the same student residence ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be p@@ iti@@ vely par@@ ame@@ ful if you maintain a fellow worker for your future wife , to separate themselves and then join them every day , and perhaps to see how to over@@ take all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot fellow worker is definitely not to in@@ corporate your future partner , try at least to tell your abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its key in its un@@ decided room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is fine as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good Stre@@ ich is funny , but it takes only moments until he gets up to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
share a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never che@@ w any of your room with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; close your door , and place your keys in a glass of water which you will then set in the freezer - but po@@ ck@@ ering your properties at the ceiling any more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , coll@@ ars , and all @-@ deser@@ ts &quot;
the real estate companies Markus Guil@@ dner reli@@ es on the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have a lot of money .
&quot; so for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need flats , but also the mother and the needy . &quot;
&quot; I show how to get very convenient and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 year old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are p@@ ushing onto the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Guil@@ dner thinks how quickly better living space can be created : he builds in a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ deb@@ tors , many refugees are p@@ ushing for the home market . &quot;
what solutions do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ deb@@ tors : the most mass@@ aging accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms does not have sustainability .
for humans remain in a large part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a simple , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ mer@@ cen@@ ary : a very least place to be a town@@ house .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
this is different if you put people in living blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built in the pilot project , consists of three units of asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees say , it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then houses can easily be modified according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
&quot; guil@@ der : the price of 160 square meters of living space is limited to 184 000 euros , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the building has lasted for six months .
that is reasonable .
do the buildings have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have searched my project correctly .
particularly complic@@ it makes it always the imp@@ ending Dam@@ okl@@ es@@ sch@@ em special construction and the pitch order .
cre@@ epy .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated to provide three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , at least three places . &quot;
only in the cities there is no room for that .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house ?
Gil@@ dner : there were people who were accused of creating luxury constructions for asylum seek@@ ers .
what is definitely not right .
but do not tigh@@ ten the contest for paid apartments ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true ! we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built luxury apartments that could hardly perform any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or needy . &quot;
I show how to grow and install even today .
that is why it works .
&quot; Markus Guil@@ der ( 44 ) studied micro@@ systems technology in Regensburg , and at first worked with environmental analyses . &quot;
&quot; iOS 9 : how you can get the new iPhone operating system , when Apple update will be released &quot;
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting @-@ in app , press &quot; General &quot; and then choose &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , you can download the option to download and then install it . &quot;
&quot; some are un@@ distur@@ bed after the installation , as an error message is received that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the on@@ s@@ lau@@ ght goes or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls were continued at our south border , &quot; said Minister for Minister , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; however , according to it is clear that everyone who wants an asylum application , of course , can do that &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the supply and safety of people stand in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; of course , it may be clear that there are clear signals . &quot; &quot; the Minister said . &quot;
people must not know that we don &apos;t accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows including the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia ref@@ uses
&quot; the Croatian government previously predicted that Slovenia would like to continue travelling around refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and in any circumstances , cor@@ rid@@ ors were able to build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; quite like this , the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ heads Z@@ ni@@ dar , in Lai@@ bach , does not . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia will rather take the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; however , the border with Croatia is already heavily controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister says , Slo@@ veni@@ ans want to have its limits for refugees but not abri@@ d@@ les . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must complete its comm@@ it@@ ments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; says Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian Government said that the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday in East Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to avoid the registry . &quot;
the Croatian police could interv@@ ene in the near corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik Airport has been constantly increasing police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; primarily by Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
even life services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the days ahead , his country reck@@ on with some 4000 refugees , the Minister of the Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo were also transported to the Maced@@ onian border with migrants to the Hungarian border to Croatia , and agreed in Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade , however , was aware that it was to suggest a certain routes : &quot; neither can we do , nor want to do this , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serb border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day other buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants had been traveling through Serbia all night , some 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border with Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so did the police say that we are going to come here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually become ob@@ sol@@ ete in the past t@@ arri@@ es of the past Balkan @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a little further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously st@@ resses that his country was prepared for the case of a strong state of refugees to achieve possible fo@@ rest@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; he did not called details , but he pointed out that Croatia is a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
you perform strict controls to qualify for the membership in the Schengen .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners present a good reference to the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , behind the Hungarian border , about 300 refugees continue to be detained . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border guards Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
&quot; whether the remaining fug@@ iti@@ ves go further to the Croatian border , is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the Serb domestic minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ani was trying to calm him at a local eye cand@@ y in Hor@@ gos : he will hold the debates about Alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
there is not so much to deal with very high refugees .
could not say if they were supposed to continue their journey over Hungary or Croatia or another country .
helper for migrants - dangerous - Alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian Refu@@ ge@@ ologists have already begun to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes are set in by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border some 20 years after the conflict of the conflict there is still no more ro@@ uted min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police declared that a team of min@@ ers were sent to the border region . &quot;

Fed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced &quot;
&quot; Fed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appointing results for the last quarter , and the Lie@@ ge @-@ Gig@@ ant lowered his profit margin to a whole year because of the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in its goods transport service . &quot;
the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday .
&quot; at this time last year , Fed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period . &quot;
the share dropped below 2.5 per cent in the Pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening ceremony on Wednesday .
&quot; Fed@@ Ex Group said to earn a prize of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 cent less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts were expected according to a survey by Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; the lower view comes in spite of the price increases , which will amount to an average of 4.9 percent , and will be effective on 4th January and despite the higher percentage of bo@@ oming imports of heavy and large packages that will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless anticipated that the result was expected , compared with the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income and growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company gets &quot; solid earnings when considering the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , into consideration . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays @-@ employment have been announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , which is planning to hire approx . 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 extra working forces , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , Fed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just under the 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the 12 by Z@@ acks Investment Research said analysts predicted . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks were expecting an expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Fed@@ Ex review the decline in international priority shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate sales at his express express shipment . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results of Fed@@ Ex ground .
&quot; sales of goods transport rose by 29 percent in the last quarter , but operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit posted higher income due to higher prices , while net income fell by higher working costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the Fed@@ Ex shares increased by $ 3.@@ 85 or 2.5 percent , up to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday they included 11 percent loss for the year , 17 percent below a record high on June 11th . &quot;

&quot; however , since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; and this third mandate may be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too narrow to predi@@ ct them . it is announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the close to zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data in the economy indicate that they grow solid , most recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets make the already clear F@@ ed representative to rein@@ force the interest rate for federal bonds - and be it only by one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will primarily be the most important of what they observe , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of the Mak@@ ers of Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I guess if they were looking for a pre@@ text that were not increasing the interest rate , increasing in@@ security around the global market is enough justi@@ fication yet , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no con@@ sensus about what the F@@ ed will do , which secu@@ res the financial market . &quot;
some half of the econom@@ ists who have been questioned recently from Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week .
&quot; financial markets are expected to wait a b@@ ed , with a key inde@@ ator , which shows a 30 % chance to increase an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ist will alle@@ vi@@ ate the blow by which they promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average increased by 2@@ 28,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % at 16.@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action has been triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the pro@@ positions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in their statement to calm the financial markets , so that they didn &apos;t get into panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a Zin@@ c threat would calm the financial markets , because it would remove un@@ certainty when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow fusion of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in the spring and early summer , that it was in this year despite the findings of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of job creation in August slow@@ ed down , the improvement in the labour market was solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level which the F@@ ed as full @-@ employment looks . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; even though inflation remained less below the 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representative said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and needs it due to the impact on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ d@@ son , Chief Econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the financial markets around the world had agreed at the end of the month after China had scored his currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would threatened global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered a little over this month , while the Dow is almost 10 % off the price of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when they should increase the interest . &quot;
&quot; if events were not acted on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks would not come in this meeting , said Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and an ex @-@ employee of the US bank@@ note bank . &quot;
now he tells us that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better in the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of un@@ certainty about what the effects on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China &quot; &quot; said O@@ lin@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the primary means of the F@@ ed , hence it should not be included in terms of decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the final effect the F@@ ed Monetary Union has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the only note of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed might spread her mon@@ et@@ ary expansion . &quot; b@@ anded the confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly being inter@@ tw@@ ined by the F@@ ed representative , they cannot only monitor the developments of other sites , but also coun@@ table with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ net Inc. . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , observed that month that &quot; F@@ ed a story of over@@ actions on the financial market movement , which apparently does not appear with the economic foundations . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ack@@ ers , voting right of the Federal Open Market Committee , declares a interest rate , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; based on a financial crisis in Asia , F@@ ed managed to lower its lead interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite a notable impact on growth in the US &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
one year later the F@@ ed representatives introduced these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis as the market crash in 2008 , &quot; &quot; said Adam S. Pos@@ en , former member of the Committee on the T@@ ins@@ ing of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest tur@@ mo@@ il will not come close to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to fall into the situation in which they fear of a interest rate because the markets felt shou@@ ting , &quot; said Pos@@ en , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until the change is changed , I do not believe they should expect the time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try the LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
&quot; yes , Chinatown &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai @-@ wholesale trading market that sells to the general public .
&quot; yeah , it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central hub and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decor@@ ations . &quot;
there &apos;s even a car section when you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the course . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping basket is hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and cheap ) in this shop is near the boxes and has various participation options .
what you are here : do you need anything - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian speci@@ alities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat company is extensive , also the fish @-@ ek@@ e - the staff behind the counter will drain the fish and fil@@ et the fish , and even on request for you . &quot;

&quot; you buy here : restaurant owners and co@@ oks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide courses are suitable for shopping cars and forkli@@ fts .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the Cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown , and the city center - a few blocks away by Philippe The original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not hard to find a parking lot . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small lif@@ esp@@ an for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany this day .
preparing a warm welcome is not without the commitment of the volunteers .
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there is a number of people who support un@@ real asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with the body and soul teacher .
she still teaches with their 74 chap@@ els as well .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; it also helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is different to have lessons than at the right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande promotes diet for healthy styles
&quot; the Brazilian p@@ anti@@ the@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to clari@@ fy women in a sho@@ cking way , how important good nutrition is during the breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of images of babies that have been painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies every nutrients it needed to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , wa@@ vering and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake should not supply the only dietary adaptation that should be the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually fluctu@@ ate the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , un@@ healthy eating of the child can affect the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the Municipal Coun@@ cill@@ or at Bern@@ ried will permit the building application for the 2.3 million euro collector &apos;s hall .
and he did an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; the plant@@ ations for the long @-@ awaited gy@@ ms at the Bern@@ sem@@ der sports grounds are step by step by step by step further : in the recent community of the excav@@ ation , the excav@@ ation was blessed without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; before that , the panel , amongst others , had a request for the statutory &quot; exception &quot; respec@@ tiv@@ ating &quot; liberation &quot; of a valid building plan . &quot;
&quot; with the exception &quot; &quot; it was the permission to make a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; saddle shelter with non @-@ mit@@ able first and roof super@@ structures should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; as a result , we get a wonder@@ fully large southern roof together , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Liberation , &quot; again , the roof of the roof , for energy reasons - is supposed to be mandatory for energy reasons - rather than in the development plan below ten degrees . &quot;
&quot; thus , the volume of the hall is significantly reduced . &quot;
&quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof of the roof does not contain any &quot; exceptions , &quot; with the Bern@@ sem@@ ary joint as a rule , is rather restri@@ ctive for the liberation applications rather restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; however , at the gy@@ ms of gy@@ mna@@ stics , they are no recur@@ ring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gy@@ ms structure at the sports centre is a community project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated in costs .
grants are expected by school and investment promotion .
&quot; in the next trial , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ long hall is now submitted to the Board . &quot;
hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is scheduled to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new medical director at Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; they see the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH , in front of the district court Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however the Supervisory Board will make a decision on Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
&quot; if plans should be implemented , all of the more than 50 employees would continue to be employed at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should be attacked by fishermen and the next existing station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; in W@@ eil@@ heim , employees who cannot place with Sch@@ ong@@ au is said to be a workplace in W@@ eil@@ heim , then J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are informed about the plans .
&quot; when she has triggered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic until the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice in immediate vicinity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question he who is to succeed , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game that declared itself ready to take over line with his team after Sch@@ ong@@ au on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; in any case , for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a spread of the offer in the area of Internal Medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the internal station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , Fischer said with his team , if the Supervisory Board is agreed to take both houses , until the next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which has more than 35 beds , is supposed to be closed down in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg for almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this planned for 2018 , when the current rehabilitation is completed at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , came to meet the fact that the House , which is in possession of the Federal Association , is to be used as an accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers in the future . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll close it . as with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several consider@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are a short @-@ time care of Car@@ itas and Tag@@ esp@@ an sy@@ chiat@@ ric . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back again , &quot; says Fischer over the Qu@@ asi move to the Le@@ ch that had been accepted by the employees &quot; positively and understand@@ able . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective of the house , in which Fischer has worked as a head of head for more than 30 years . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ran berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened with closure , and sections were closed down in recent decades , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;
&quot; today , the manual of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lions are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) at the Berg@@ ischer HC . &quot;
&quot; in Wuppertal , the league leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favorite , and there is no reason to persu@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; in the last season , the Bad@@ ener per@@ ched a painful defeat in the B@@ HC and have lost some things there . &quot;
hunting attack with two injured near Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their corn harvest at the morning hours .
during the super@@ l@@ eness on a corn field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) there were several h@@ unters in action like the police immediately .
&quot; after a closing ceremony , the 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospital . &quot;
&quot; just as it could happen to the accident , first of all was un@@ clear . &quot;
the det@@ ective police were determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz victims of violence
a crime scene led to the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate family since Saturday .
&quot; in the interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old tried to have killed the you@@ ths and thrown their bodies in a canal in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one of 16 @-@ year @-@ old girl from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate has fallen victim to a violent crime .
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the young woman was found in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern at Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern as the public prosecutor and police informed Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , another 20 @-@ year @-@ old was considered to be a crime scene , who , indeed , conf@@ essed the statement and investig@@ ators led to the discovery of the dead . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning , after having arrived at home on the eve after a visit of a fall in rock . &quot;
&quot; in search of the young lady , investig@@ ators first refer to personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the absence of friends in the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the mi@@ xes , a crime happened against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a canal in rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities were interro@@ gated in police interro@@ gation , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and put dead bodies in the se@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be led to the port @-@ hop@@ per on Wednesday , investig@@ ators put the burden to him . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the further investigations should begin by the immediate circumstances of fact . &quot;
refugees need accommodations : study warns of H@@ ousing .
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing building is faced with a challenge .
the distribution combat on the German residential property market has begun long ago .
&quot; with the adv@@ ent of refugees and working people from the EU , more people push for a market already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with income @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , we would have to build 400,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
one study on this result is a study on behalf of the &quot; social housing &quot; of social housing .
&quot; in comparison , there are 26@@ 0,000 units in Germany last year . &quot;
&quot; this covers 14@@ 0,000 apartments . &quot;
refugees are not obliged following their stay for the first three months of their stay when asylum seek@@ ers stay in a week camp .
many of them put in the apartment market and in the long sn@@ akes are in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to Stati@@ st@@ isches Bundes@@ amt , in the last year , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were granted . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the residential area is not only to the rising refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant deep@@ enings in housing policies over the last years .
Germany Schie@@ fer a apartment deficit ahead of itself from year to year is becoming bigger .
&quot; currently there are approximately 77@@ 0,000 housing units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in big cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed un@@ voluntarily because of the au@@ te in the apartment market no longer at &quot; Hotel M@@ om . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capita dropped again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
the Alliance &quot; Social Res@@ identi@@ al &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new inc@@ enti@@ ves to stim@@ ulate social housing with social housing .
&quot; in this way , the property tax could be wai@@ sted and the basic tax for funded homes may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , there must be an attractive tax deduc@@ tions . &quot;
the support programme for refugee quot@@ ations in the State Bank Kf@@ W comes well with towns and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the launch was 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the 300 million euros provided in their disposal . &quot;
now the project could be increased .
refugees have vac@@ ancy : Croatia and Slovenia as a corridor
&quot; there is practically no coming to Hungary , because more refugees are choosing the way for Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb Announ@@ ces that through Slovenia &apos;s journey to the North without barrier .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring countries of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if it is necessary we will be organising a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Home Secretary Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not a Schengen area .
&quot; after the de@@ comp@@ ence of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to proceed from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; for 500 people had arrived at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik &apos;s border , the Croatian television set reports . &quot;
Hungary had sealed off its border for refugees at the day before .
new laws that came into force on the same day have been virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous and vis@@ it@@ ory asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to happen refugees .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic said , &quot; You can travel , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , people who do not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
Croatian police arrested the first refugees at the Serbian Border of Serbia in the morning of Serbia &apos;s neighbouring country Croatia .
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both with the bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serb border the refugees are not p@@ umped on f@@ ences .
there are other haz@@ ards on this side : there are sharp mines there in the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ el@@ ers are now able to create a safe passage now .
&quot; after Hungary , after closing the border , hardly more refugees are coming . &quot;
on Tuesday the police attracted 3@@ 66 people .
&quot; just before the circuit on Monday , there were 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws levels the transc@@ ending and damage of the threshold limit as an off@@ ense .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south@@ Hungarian border city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
his prisoner sentenced detention to jail for up to five years and the deportation of the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , on Tuesday in the newly appointed &quot; Tran@@ sitting &quot; area , 94 Asy@@ lan@@ ces have taken counter@@ parts , of which almost all - 93 - at the main transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicant , 13 families with small children and two older people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stopped .
&quot; however , no one has no more view to granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; secure third country . &quot; &quot;
the associated asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; Tran@@ sect &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees assembled . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers began to clean up workers .
&quot; they collected gar@@ bage , tens of thousands of people left behind the road@@ side in the past weeks . &quot;
&quot; pl@@ anting lat@@ ti@@ ces have been dismant@@ led , and one of the stor@@ y@@ ons in the border was rebuilt . &quot;
nobody wanted to express this conversion .
&quot; after closing the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees . &quot;
the country also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but about 20,000 migrants sat still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people are waiting for the continuing journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; there , train service from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on order of the German authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Freil@@ assing , smaller groups of refugees came across by walking distance . &quot;
Mayor drove &quot; Out &quot; on the border
&quot; we were employed by the bridge at Sunday with the vac@@ ancy , when ten people suddenly stood with travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; So W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to pass by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprising the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , however , for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately had his assistance and that ran along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Na@@ he Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we immediately felt immediately with J@@ ause and beverages . &quot;
&quot; we talked straight , we bring them to Pass@@ au with the car . &quot;
&quot; that was of course , for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not take it to a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very happy with us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the stran@@ ded train drivers have switched on Sunday evening in Wels from a ICE in a regional train direction Pass@@ au , to avoid it after the short notice that the rail traffic was stopped after Germany , but later on the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was posed in front of the W@@ ern@@ stein border on the inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ firm linked the Bavarian neighbours with the Bavarian neighbours - concluded a two @-@ stroke , daily organised by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án have now sends another Z@@ ig@@ thousands to us and is a logical result of an apparent policy :
&quot; instead of helping in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke refugee camp , our Chancellor hosted national and officially the attitude of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ rels of National Soci@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this policy is not only those Austri@@ ans , which are now faced in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions . &quot;
&quot; the poultry workers will also have to state that the &quot; praised country , &quot; which she has invited and welcome , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; in view of the persistent refugee flow and the near wind , there will be a major challenge for people seeking refuge . &quot;
&quot; and there will be one more major , peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad , to the quest for 35,000 win@@ dy Qu@@ arti@@ ers &quot;
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee .
Christian Konrad is used to be his word .
the government used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to susp@@ end Qu@@ arti@@ ers for thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the ground @-@ up center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad , had already received a handle . &quot;
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees that arrived in Austria on Monday to be without big work , Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; master@@ ing power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry spoke , on the other hand , from a &quot; crisis @-@ free situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad with a need of 8@@ 5,000 qu@@ arti@@ sts in the he@@ fty year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the numbers , 35,000 new accommodations have to be found in the coming weeks - 20.000 are to host countries , 15,000 of the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without the ground , &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the governor &apos;s cent@@ ur@@ ions , he has already held talks . &quot;
&quot; this would have been assured , even for the coming refugees to Qu@@ arti@@ ere . &quot;
&quot; it runs well in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; Ferry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Man@@ atar supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born , which should be clari@@ fied as the church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations of the asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator are also included in the ORF Action &quot; Help , such as we . &quot;
individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodations on the platform .
&quot; in addition , it is hop@@ ed for hotels that will stay in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as a &quot; very high &quot; accommodation .
&quot; in not@@ ices , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ator must keep a certain amount of hand@@ tu@@ ch@@ hi@@ ch or size of the upper party . &quot;
for a temporary time the &quot; security standards &quot; would have to apply .
&quot; contrary to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful to provide advice on Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am an older Lord that one does not say without further into the face .
gravity is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the Republic &apos;s no cost as they declared themselves .
the number of employees increased to three to four .
the own Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ cian has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz @-@ office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; first no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings like tips @-@ arena and design center for the housing of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary for the sake of victims that could be placed without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emergency , however , more sites can be checked on their suit@@ ability . &quot;
critic@@ isms of the principal leader in the division of refugees inside the state department .
other districts have to offer its contribution here .
hofer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a long phone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) , has en@@ cir@@ cled with the refugee question on Monday . &quot;
hofer has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuing journey of refugees in the FR@@ G continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there is the corresponding border controls . &quot;
special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any more .
&quot; however , the protective searches would however be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger demanded more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; in addition to inspec@@ tions over@@ sees Austria on its borders , for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , Austria is a logical next &quot; out of the existence of the Germans . &quot;
the next run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the re@@ organisation of the New Ship@@ yard &quot; at the line of Lin@@ zer is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed , the rest ( 2700 square meters ) is said to be let for young , innovative companies from the technology range . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine , in the start @-@ up companies of the New Ship@@ yard and later , some of which were to be acquired . &quot;
&quot; already from the start , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - what is said in Nieder@@ haus@@ er &apos;s lot : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , Austria Upper Austria and the federal state ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is sp@@ illed from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and the Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2700 square meters are already rented in the building , for another 40 percent give en@@ quiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ staff opened second shop in the arcade
the new shop is the Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the centre .
actually J@@ utta Bre@@ it wanted to get a dog .
this project had to de@@ fer the 49 year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market arcade : finally she has now grown in a form of other business locations .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop , compared to the business , in which they sell among other bags , cases , shoes and clothes of various manufacturers , now everything spins for ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
large bags and accessories up to 500 euros .
&quot; since yesterday , the new shop is in operation . &quot;
&quot; previously , several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; but I thought long , if I should open a store , &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; crucial for the decision was , amongst other things , also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a site that only sold their hand@@ bags to which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the tiny in the grand@@ room Linz to sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters that even has Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest does choose Bre@@ it from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
most of the times I feel when something develops and I can show new trends with great prices .
&quot; why such a woman , when looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in tre@@ ach@@ ting , cannot answer the specialist with the last security . &quot;
maybe it is thinking that a beautiful bag is weigh@@ ted every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ull@@ ar maker from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ äl@@ zer ancestors came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
this feature connects maneu@@ ver with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether he comments foreign @-@ sensitive , journalists , as well as knowledge g@@ aps in international crisis policy - candidates for the US presidential campaign di@@ str@@ ates the campaign . &quot;
and cuts well .
&quot; this will also be registered in the pf@@ r@@ z@@ ic town of K@@ all@@ city , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate @-@ billi@@ on@@ age come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the f@@ er@@ n@@ fr@@ is@@ ur is a concept for many people in the wine region at the wine road .
some of the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to him -@@ zig corners which is related to him .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election mode . &quot;
the town of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
what do the vill@@ agers may think about his aim to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow inv@@ ent the somehow , but are not so impressed by the kind of conc@@ ei@@ vable way , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ eri@@ an has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous lo@@ ess@@ ences which besides Tr@@ ump also is the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) also on word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
&quot; for the king of the heart , he didn &apos;t put it here . &quot;
&quot; indeed , there is respect for the performance of the family , but even ten@@ ds the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit &apos; b@@ m@@ aul &quot; , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; random play loud by the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ city in the vicinity , &quot; Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - too High German : the investors , says she . &quot;
Tr@@ ump happens so from the village of the investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 served as the succe@@ eding grandfather and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ nit@@ aries .
the foundation stone of the property company were the first plot of land in New York .
&quot; but the life of grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : her desire to return to the country , failed by the Bavarian State , where the Palat@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not included Tr@@ ump , because he once had been removed without hom@@ olog@@ ation , had declared Director of the Institute of Latvian History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal out@@ flow . &quot;
this is in contrast to the mit@@ able statements of the desc@@ end@@ ents .
he had repeatedly spoke of Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a wall to deter them illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the p@@ added , this is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant killing Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a kin@@ ship , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer retired in the Americans is rather dist@@ ancing , &quot; he is always so temper@@ ed . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump happens ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ city . &quot;
&quot; the pend@@ sion of Veron@@ ika Sch@@ ramm menti@@ ons like man@@ holes K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter , like a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz came on a visit to the church organ , which was generally well received . &quot;
&quot; I couldn &apos;t imagine that by Donald , the 68 @-@ year @-@ old says . &quot;
&quot; it is better if he doesn &apos;t win the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had at the time of his grandfather in the USA , like him , would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ land@@ ler Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are sexually mature without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;

the grand bl@@ iss for seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of people to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wit@@ ched father , who managed to settle down with his two children at the New Zealand coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 219 million viewers . &quot;
critics had asked whether Thom@@ son could bear a hit show solo with the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of last night answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with a crowd of 1,@@ 136 million spectators and defeated easy The Block ( 83@@ 8,000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood are the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets reveals ? ...
&quot; but L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have apparently un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , at the time of Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was bank@@ rolled in the largest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three left @-@ left girls will certainly not be priced if she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three two are invited to check , you possibly have given a hint on who will be the winner . &quot;
&quot; Sam Wood continues its lips until the final on Thursday , sealed . &quot;
&quot; all three women have left over ly@@ rical expression , why Wood the perfect man is and called his meaning for humor , amb@@ ition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question will be asked , &quot; If not you , who should get the last rose ? &quot; could her answers to play a play , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ or . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly - apart from itself - Mack@@ ay as the best female partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sar@@ os ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were rather compatible and I thought it was in the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing with both feet on the earth , it makes so much fun with it to be together , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw her and they did the right chemistry .
they feel pleasant and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; from her point of view , Mack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood will be &quot; One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it was clear to me that this is obviously not only a game - I am ready to stop him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , then she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining naked girl alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle marked great interest after moving into the USA - and there were many other teams , which sent after its impressive open training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ den chose the San Francisco Bor@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
some coach would have banned from the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a lack as he lost the Aussie Rug@@ by @-@ League @-@ Conver@@ ting at his first pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ den the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to display his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of holding his ro@@ ok@@ ies , he encouraged the remainder of the team by the mill , he encouraged her . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ dn in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sport@@ sc@@ cam In@@ man told that Hay@@ den has also encouraged by senior Sci@@ entist Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his pat@@ ted catch and to take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes was pat@@ ched at a Pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of the Minnesota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the way that Hay@@ den and his massive Australian followers would have been hoping for his N@@ FL debut .
&quot; Hay@@ on left the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could no longer present in his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that comes now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ dn . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ dn compared the shar@@ pen@@ er with his debut in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area was held for a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; party leader , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the start of the FW @-@ autumn St@@ at at the beginning of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns &apos;s schools , if it is not the new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to preserve the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get default tests in the Bavarian educational system . &quot;
the state @-@ day of the Free elec@@ torate has dar@@ ed to fri@@ day in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commun@@ e .
quite different key areas were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now domin@@ ating the &quot; Free voters &quot; meetings .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum is handed over to the retreat , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called on the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; so it is not going on , we need the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate . &quot;
remote asylum seek@@ ers want to slide the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seek@@ ers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seek@@ ers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the FW @-@ Group critic@@ ised that several states are not consistent , &quot; We br@@ äu@@ ed nationwide standards of the German states . &quot;

4 people killed after police officers g@@ ond@@ back to protest@@ ers in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police g@@ ond@@ ins demonstrated against the proposed new constitution which was demonstr@@ ating against the proposed new constitution , an official one on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ de@@ hi district , about 175 miles west of Kathmandu &apos;s capital . &quot;
&quot; Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ k@@ al , Chief Executive Officer , Bish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ k@@ al , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom were stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
&quot; Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said , the police have entered Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and shot down in the air before returning to Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de . &quot;
&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the Gum@@ mig@@ ra@@ de used to kill them from which they could kill , although they are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , obviously such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of non@@ violent protest in Nepal known as southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Madrid should say that new provinces , which would be formed as part of the proposed new constitution , would decrease their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal of the ethnic group of Th@@ arus that want to own a state .
&quot; at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been disp@@ utes in violent cl@@ ashes since the age of 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement signed the country in provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal known for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution was on the road since 2008 , but the legisl@@ ature accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ature has said this week to vote on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional bill in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;

now the plans for a new holiday resort at the Little Sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ing , the mid @-@ sized Em@@ den company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been standing on the non @-@ public parts of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure of the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , led by the investors and the management of confidenti@@ ality , Ralf Behr@@ inger went out of the system construction management in the offensive : &quot; we haven &apos;t had an answer to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the board members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to meet all rum@@ ours now .
&quot; for months , the project has been in discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; intense reactions under marine g@@ iers that had come across the meeting , called out the pictures and new details to the desired hotel construction . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , marine fisher@@ man and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the Ab@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z that prot@@ ru@@ des all other blo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like several other project critic that would increase traffic by the proposed size of the system : &quot; all the buses come , that it expects &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what is happening in the good one hectare of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; only first of all , we have to suggest an conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the plans are even variable . &quot;

Google launches dup@@ lication donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL , O ) announced a dou@@ bling don@@ ate campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that have survived thousands of refugees trying to flee the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the announcement of the donations called on his blog .
&quot; instead of rele@@ asing a manager who wants to make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant , who escaped with her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , has her personal experience . &quot;
&quot; for our trip , many dark train and bus drives , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , were included . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and mig@@ rate crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit groups that provide help for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first million collected donations will be doubled up to € 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / book@@ mark at 11 million $ .
&quot; Europe is confron@@ ted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , mainly caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which attracted more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war , Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
&quot; as a result , the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years . &quot;
it is still too early to say if slightly surviving people with diabetes after weight loss surgery is longer living than those who have not @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death @-@ data require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , a expert of weight loss surgery which wrote an editorial to the new trial in j@@ ama arrest . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; obesity has proved efficient in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and most studies have been carried out in humans , most of which are ob@@ ese ob@@ ese with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BMI of 25 or more shows that someone is overweight , and people with a BMI over 30 are considered ob@@ ese . &quot;
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data collected in a study since 2007 , and compare two types of obesity - Mag@@ b@@ ypass and stomach sli@@ pping - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI of those who underwent this operation , from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this trial . &quot;
&quot; however , the BMI at the age of non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who under@@ go surgery in a surgical procedure , 36 % of the disease was totally dissolved and around 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is fully only triggered by one percent in comparison with the diabetes and partly in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results in controls on the blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better found in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors took out . &quot;
researchers also overs@@ aw the blood @-@ level of ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c that reflects blood sugar levels throughout time .
&quot; in A@@ 1@@ c , hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical therapy group there remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - is reflected in the improved ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level , did not decrease the mortality rate in five years , as the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also deteri@@ or@@ ates average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ re@@ ct@@ omy @-@ Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and received larger provisions in the BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ flow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the new study does not show a survival benefit from surgery after five years , notes from a study of heavier human beings in Sweden suggests that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to ob@@ ese people who underwent an adi@@ pos@@ itas operation , about 29 percent less likely to die during the course of 15 years , compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study does not have an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was a so@@ othing for individuals with a BMI of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this bottom BMI group , without increased risk of death or kidney disease , said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and her doctors should begin to take weight seriously , once the patient lies with the BMI between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are too long to wait until we bring people seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have induced your body with obesity and diabetes , is a reverse really difficult . &quot;
love story in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück
&quot; it is a topic that is currently increasingly re@@ cont@@ emp@@ t in the fiction : a young woman , at school times un@@ popular and un@@ fore@@ se@@ eable , meets after years the flock of her youth , and he fell in love with her . &quot;
as well in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond love story , the Roman is likely to be interesting for H@@ uns@@ creen readers , because he plays in long@@ lers and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe can &apos;t record all refugees , the Dalai Lama said , and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leaders urged to end violence in the country &apos;s home countries .
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of refugee struggles against the beginning of his 10 day visiting in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion , which is devoted to ethics studies . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity are , before the interests of the individual nations , or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of Western European countries on the refugee crisis is ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama bet@@ r@@ oth@@ ed Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you must re@@ think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we have to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence never has solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist bombing of September 11 , and revealed that the United States had a chain of un@@ control@@ l@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he translated violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the past 4 years
&quot; tox@@ ins centers in the United States reports a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , who swal@@ low up alcoholic and disinf@@ ection , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue from hand @-@ infectious agents in children under 12 are reporting from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children always come more frequently to those products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency department , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children should drink their disinf@@ ect@@ ant , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or due to a mutation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant drink only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ant with non @-@ soft oral water to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be logged in attractive no@@ zzle of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( Hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those who are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange juice that are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; particularly with to@@ dd@@ lers , a few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; says Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ist Centre at the University of Kansas , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t make a si@@ p whis@@ key down , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children get it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume too much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a 6 year old girl who recently had four injec@@ tors from following straw@@ berry shower disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , has been taken into an emergency exit . &quot;
&quot; their blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold , considered to be as drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ win@@ dler Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah cleared her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
&quot; doctors overs@@ aw the night in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and pushed her head , &quot; said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; said Or@@ toria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ affir@@ m &apos;s mother , CNN . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or disinf@@ ect@@ ators to use and disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ection outside the child &apos;s range .
&quot; in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ant were associated with fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ low of disinf@@ ect@@ asis , which contained a toxic , non @-@ clear ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product me@@ thanol contained a le@@ thal solution , instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ kohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class were scheduled in New York State , their &quot; mur@@ al &quot; teacher , claiming some anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , according to a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic against disinf@@ ect@@ ant disinf@@ ect@@ ant and sc@@ anned them out of their space .
the police seized the susp@@ icious plan called &quot; D@@ ign@@ ite &quot; and exhibited its disciplinary action to the education authority .

&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people not just talk about the return of Rang@@ ers .
they talked about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talked about both teams and that &apos;s what they were interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the old Fir@@ m games , and there are not only those people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;

&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom had risen by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was about 5.5 per cent about the official reporting of 5.5 per cent , as the statistics of the National Statistics Bureau ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;

why am I to be an exec@@ utions in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later , except at a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it is not done , I will sit in a spect@@ ator in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison @-@ injection . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation for the first time in January was about his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; the day closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists may look in the USA , and there are often more applications than positions available , then a ma@@ ke@@ able lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who is chosen , who will be able to watch it ? &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , I will sit in addition to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , which I have developed my own relationship with telephone numbers and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh often when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook &amp; pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to im@@ pose my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of a prisoner , how he wants it , and you will receive access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained by her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she is still thinking that it is false , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had problems with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I had to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses .
&quot; but he wants a international reporter present there , to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations should help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please hear the show of po@@ d@@ casts I did . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back here again for all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a fav@@ oured act .
&quot; however , I believe that a strong li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of murder is not guilty of murder . &quot;
&quot; I believe , that there is no enough evidence of justi@@ fying a death part . &quot;
I believe his execution is wrong .
&quot; and from this point , I will see him die . &quot;
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
&quot; there will be other rep@@ orters , in which you can turn on for it . &quot;
&quot; what you can get from me is what it means , a man to die unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he is always trying to do what is best for racing and he himself fell under difficult conditions as it went to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ sample at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he held back 18 months for the accus@@ ation accus@@ ation , and did not want it to see how too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I &apos;ve been eating long on it , but sometimes you are so fru@@ str@@ ated that everything came out suddenly , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know it was going on .
&quot; sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home this evening and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to go lifted up head , and I want to think that my owners are trying to try my best . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not practice this , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
&quot; then , I should think about what I do with my license . &quot;
Moo@@ dy had previously made the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com that the integration department had attempted to pick up its stable .
&quot; before eight months ago , Terry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will be asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables , to give information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
&quot; obviously , you believe that I am a che@@ aters . &quot;
&quot; if that is the case , they certainly take part in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to reconc@@ ile me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former President of Route L , David Moo@@ dy , president of Route L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of Route L , were aware of this and are still today . &quot;
should I consider this to mind that it is personally ?
&quot; has the Route L permanently behave and makes people out of the train@@ ers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ? &quot;
am I bad to the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take me my license and viol@@ ate myself , and I have no doubt that what I say is thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
&quot; I will practice pressure on them , and p@@ ushing them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the fru@@ ition levels of the trainer have assembled with the long @-@ lasting high cob@@ alt examination in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led to him that he could lay his license above the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for its preparation for the uns@@ cre@@ ted master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the &quot; &quot; race @-@ treatment rule &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse cast , which pushed back against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing sports .
&quot; I have to take over full responsibility for that , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues pushed the mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
&quot; it could have been so yesterday all the day , what was so . &quot;
but it was so on the racing day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with a pack on the race tag . a study of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules but here you went too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man S@@ cur@@ ed after driver cur@@ ses
the police arrested a man in cob@@ ram on the weekend following a cl@@ ash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with heavy injuries while having hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Murray @-@ Valley Highway .
the police said that drivers drove further without stopping to help the injured rider .
on Monday there was a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia of the police in She@@ p@@ part@@ on .
he is expected to be charged for driver and lower aid and charged for other traffic light .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy proposes to fight against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling his Player as an &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites .
&quot; Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ rators tent@@ atively open the Storm @-@ competition &quot; Ring@@ way &quot; with his team during the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ co coach Wayne Bennett made a hard cover to the Storm team , after his team had defeated the final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game &quot; &quot; exempl@@ ar &quot; &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland shouldn &apos;t be &quot; too good &quot; at R@@ ingen . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the killing of his team and said that she only focuses on her &quot; contact &quot; with the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cr@@ iti@@ que of two leading train@@ ers in his team are confident that they were concerned that they are worried about to be beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; that emerg@@ es again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring games , as they struck us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our def@@ ensive System or techniques all year . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kl@@ es at a real emphasis , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around . &quot;
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not used to get used to it so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange as it appears again to this season .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked his idea from &quot; exciting football &quot; and remembers his ment@@ or , that Benn@@ ettes St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons took the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Wayne goes from exciting football .
he compared his play on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their game was &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was cr@@ iti@@ zed as a boring team , and Wayne said he will take care of a divor@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball@@ game that you want to play if you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , and now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I build up trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it went round the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co versus Co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks made and no points of ten@@ sion@@ ing ?
it is the game sched@@ ules for me .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will be meeting in a stage later . &quot;
the Storm @-@ Team has free this weekend because they won &apos;t have the right to receive either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I park . ticket sales start next Tuesday morning .
Serbia with 200.000 $ damage after drug ad@@ age
&quot; a man who may possibly have been sentenced to life imprisonment for about 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which was s@@ mu@@ g@@ ged to Queensland , was released on a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men detained last month after the Federal Police arrived 100 kg of the drug in the ship Sol@@ ay , which arrived from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and arrived in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he found his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the course of the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life penalty for attemp@@ ting to own a commercial crowd of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argu@@ ed that it was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café may have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; judge on the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the flight risk of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
&quot; he travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of a complaint , he lies the police on his position . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in common to gain its release .
&quot; after reading the ei@@ ving explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Judge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be enough to stop him , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and Serbian pass , stops daily at the police and maintains at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
the appearance of the A5 at Karlsruhe : leadership @-@ out takes apart .
&quot; during a dri@@ ve@@ away with three trucks , on the motorway 5 at Karlsruhe , the truck driver was severely injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
&quot; two of the three involved trucks had slow@@ ed off before a permanent construction , in the direction of Basel . &quot;
&quot; the third driver observed too late and tried to escape in vain in the last moment , as the police immediately hur@@ ried . &quot;
the executive building of the accident @-@ caused was completely apart .
the driver was badly injured in a hospital .
the motorway between Bru@@ ck@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was closed for six hours until 2 pm .
&quot; the damage was raised in the amount of 12@@ 2.000 Euro . &quot;
Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used phone of girls to draw P@@ iz@@ oph@@ ile to S@@ end of pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ d used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the telephone of the girl , when he slept , log@@ ging into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a number of un@@ an@@ resistant images of children who were sent from another user . &quot;
the girl aw@@ aking up later and discovered the telephone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping h@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found her conf@@ using news and al@@ im@@ pover@@ ished her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of this reason and saw the five images , analyzed then computers , which were found under the address and discovered &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , &quot; concepts for searching for in@@ consistent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said to the officials to have done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ oph@@ ile in the Internet &quot; and then he called &quot; to be a polic@@ eman , to make them frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; the state lawyer E@@ ili@@ ie Robertson told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court , &quot; &quot; he said it would be a su@@ p - that he is ho@@ oked to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he gave us that the searches were carried out on the computer of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman , to be frigh@@ tened to ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
&quot; he was asked about his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures , asking him to send more photos . &quot;
&quot; he said he did so , to enti@@ ce it . &quot;
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , when he dr@@ ink@@ eth and said he wants to see pictures of rape or murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and her mother and her weeping . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ consistent photos on the telephone and con@@ front the accused .
the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endant &apos;s computers and Play@@ station took advantage to speak with girls who looked much younger than he had .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ dee , pleaded guilty according to the indictment , to have been in@@ consistent pictures of children on June 14 last year , and not before the court to be released on 24 March this year . &quot;
lawyer Gregor S@@ in asked that H@@ og@@ g was not published in the register of sexual off@@ ender as they could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; is going to be found in his understanding .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence by October to obtain background reports about social welfare .
&quot; H@@ og@@ g was granted a security deposit in this case , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to others . &quot;
&quot; before the date of judgment , he was accepted to the list of sexual offen@@ ders . &quot;
ways to avoid small fron@@ tier trans@@ itions to Germany
more refugees are picked up at the border controls on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many s@@ lan@@ ders made fear of discovery and capture the people increased in smaller border trans@@ itions
&quot; out of the Austrian side , one spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border of the river Inn , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn have picked up more than 1000 refugees in the Coun@@ ties of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al @-@ Inn . &quot;
&quot; they were walking through bridges and j@@ acks , to the German site . &quot;
there they are accepted by federal polic@@ emen and re@@ directed to registration .
&quot; according to the previous year , on Wednesday , the Munich Main Railway Station once again met more refugees . &quot;
&quot; there were approximately 700 people in the state alone until 8.00 o &apos;clock , spokes@@ man said in the morning . &quot;
after the re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the town .
&quot; Stuttgart : runner @-@ off of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the southwest &quot;
meteor@@ ologists war@@ n against crash bars in the South@@ west of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a pres@@ su@@ re@@ pres@@ ets over Western Europe , warm ocean air flows come into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the powerful bass was the for@@ erunner of the Trop@@ ical R@@ igh@@ s , Henry , who had pulled from the Atlantic ocean over the past few days . &quot;
heavy storms and str@@ orm are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , until Thursday morning the Black Forest is still to be reck@@ oned on in the Black Forest , on Schwä@@ b@@ ische Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with ar@@ ches of 60 to 90 hours . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun rises to the sun again . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years show the motor@@ cyclists at the IAA their novel@@ ties .
2015 is mainly to be noted in the compact cars that are particularly well @-@ selling .
cars made of the compact class are particularly popular : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new regi@@ strations were accounted for by the Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August alone in this segment .
this also reflects at the International Motor Show ( Public@@ ation days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , many new compact models will be introduced between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
one of the largest pre@@ fers for the German car industry is the Opel Astra which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it is the core of the brand .
the new Astra is also not to be much more expensive for its Astra . the new Astra is also not much more expensive .
&quot; Opel introduces one step through the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra is Euro 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; moreover , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which for the first time three @-@ cylinder petrol engine also include . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors , VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra boasts a five @-@ door Opel Astra . &quot;
&quot; as a second variant , the Com@@ bi will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also shown at the International Motor Show . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA motor ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault send the fourth generation of its Astra @-@ competing Mé@@ gan@@ e its debut .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; it will arrive at the beginning of the year , then also when Com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : all new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan @-@ off@@ springs wants to find its position in the strongly growing sector . &quot;
&quot; the compact c@@ iti , with its sharp@@ ened lines , fits perfectly into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the base model will feature a fuel generator with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; but also , the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is in the case of 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe will be in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed , the shelf @-@ class DS 4 , which is shown at the International Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; the designers of the noble master finish , mainly used on the front end : the radiator gr@@ ille has been re@@ drawn , and the changed head@@ lights with LED technology was fitted . &quot;
&quot; inside the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons was reduced through a touch screen and the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play was integrated . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , at the IAA in the compact class , a number of over@@ working and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters are deser@@ ted
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial prison law , which was accommod@@ ated in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of human lives , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells . &quot;
this decision adopted the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; those affected may even hope to trust the judges , if they were only closed for few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate structure with his constitutional complaint was successfully accommod@@ ated in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; after that , the man who had gone down on the free foot again according to his lawyer , was installed in a larger cell . &quot;
his detention conditions were failed because of the in@@ corru@@ p@@ ement conditions against the Berlin country .
however the Constitutional Judge raised the verdict of the chamber of Berlin and returned to the new trial .
you see the man &apos;s human dignity .
chamber District decided on the amount of the compensation
&quot; if legal reasons for legal reasons may only be a few days after the demand for compensation , the sentence was given for compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; subject matter the legal protection of the personality feared . &quot;
the chamber Court must now clari@@ fy the amount of monetary penalty .
&quot; in the past , the Constitutional Judge often have strengthened the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
human un@@ worthy is a decision from 2011 to also use a cell without separate toilet .
&quot; moreover , on Wednesday , in November 2009 , the Berlin Constitutional Court , the prisoner of a prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ case , confirmed a decent housing . &quot;
&quot; the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs was lodged between 15 to 21 hours per day , in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ de case . &quot;
the Berlin pris@@ ons were in the headlines in the last weeks due to lack of personnel .
&quot; prisoners are therefore kept back for 23 hours , as early as aggressi@@ veness , even to stro@@ be , it should be due to the ten@@ sion@@ ed situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the judicial pres@@ sion@@ ist , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are un@@ occupied because of young people , 19 are to fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating it &quot;
immigration to refugees is a tremendous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or is determined to adopt them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany according to projections from the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Germany , according to the Statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , who , in Germany , is able to absorb a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated on the extraordinary challenge of determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can accomplish this . &quot;
&quot; what comes in Germany , convey@@ s the following overview . &quot;
&quot; it is needed , according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Buil@@ ders ) and 400@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation by the Pest@@ el @-@ Institut ) , and over the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living room is rather dramatic but above all for affordable rental objects : each year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing in the rental price are out , and in order to apply for these particularly favorable apartments will also apply . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Minister for Transport Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , therefore , aims to double the promotion , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that the pest@@ le Institute &apos;s point of view : 80 000 social housing would have to emerge annually and would have to invest a funding in the amount of 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
the scientists and Federal Minister are agree that there must also be more control benefits for investment in residential construction .
&quot; based on estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , 55 per cent of the population in Germany can be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , refugees in Germany are not worried about their qualification in order to help them , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
&quot; however , it is crucial for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the admission group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says Mig@@ r@@ ational researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political turn in Germany : from the prohibition of employment for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a job ban on asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just like the resi@@ den@@ ds to asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society itself , mainly because of the skilled professionals - mainly the view of view is thought that refugees should be faster access to the job market . &quot;
a large hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are missing German .
there is yet no choice of choice on general and vocational @-@ related speech courses .
research also shows that jobs are communic@@ ated most frequently by personal contacts .
&quot; according to the position of Thr@@ än@@ hardt , the structure of networks is the royal ple@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only few p@@ lowed parents give their children to the day@@ cares , it is estimated to be 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the root parents &quot; parents , Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ ist , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family of the K@@ ita &apos;s advantages , managing the hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the need for educ@@ ators , by the large number of refugees , would attempt to raise the Berlin Senate in order to increase the training capacity by allowing more technical schools . &quot;
students without German knowledge are prepared in the countries .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no lack , says Be@@ ate st@@ ems from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German student union estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany do want to study .
&quot; in principle , no Federal State of asylum seek@@ ers or Ged@@ ul@@ signed the study - the only exception until now was Berlin , Wi@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank handle ( CDU ) has abandoned his post@@ ure now . &quot;
study approval could be facil@@ itated access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a position of residence or dem@@ on , there are no more performances after the asylum seek@@ ers . if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; for the latter , there will be no B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G , since they do not fall under the number of eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; Ged@@ ul@@ ators have to have been living four years in Germany so far , to be eligible for B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G to be eligible , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months from January 1 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; but this financing control must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German student union . &quot;
the students should immediately obtain B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G immediately .
&quot; Islam will continue to play a most important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important component of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually add the equal rights to Islam as they have the churches , and to further develop existing State churches rights to a new state @-@ religion ratio . &quot;
important would also be the creation of an Islamic welfare association that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
at the rights are also obligations .
&quot; thus , the representative of Islam must unite with clear contacts in some and willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to allow him certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , will@@ ingness to heed to their ordin@@ ance appe@@ als to religious Fundam@@ ent@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , was on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be applied to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , those who wanted such conflicts in Germany would immediately have their right to stay here at times in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rundfunk . &quot;
he suggested to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a lot more of the whole society today than today .
&quot; thus , the majority of the majority of the company will need to change its di@@ vest@@ ment of discrimination and rac@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; Germany has indeed - as a result of European decisions , a decade @-@ discrimination against anti @-@ discrimination and equality law . &quot;
&quot; but it lear@@ ns very slowly , like the beginning of the NSU @-@ series , in which police and authorities systematically igno@@ res the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what mig@@ rant organizations and the advoc@@ acy groups of non @-@ white Germans are long demanded and what an international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention in Germany must be in reality , if the country will remain peac@@ efully for their new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany is able to maintain medical assistance to so far expected refugees , President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ s- Power and Capacities , we create this , &quot; he said to the daily mirror . &quot;
&quot; however , extra money has to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , in all the new@@ com@@ ers equ@@ ates to the registration health cards . &quot;
&quot; later , services could be calculated with the federal states . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able so many people affected by the limited power catalog to see the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors do mainly make language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de used to prove worse on their diseases as well as other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in medical clinics , in medical practices , the interpretation costs are required . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many refugees have been helped with more general medical attacks in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic eye .
&quot; among refugee camps , there are distin@@ ctly more untreated disabilities , and in the young people go to HIV @-@ En@@ lighten@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; with some other cases of disease , German doctors headed by her training but clearly , Mont@@ gom@@ ery writes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; and as regards the state of medical , the refugees possibly even occur in sight by the refugees . &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system ; some refugees are even doctors .
&quot; in order to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualification and check if necessary . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the presence of bund@@ led psych@@ otherap@@ ist ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most suffering from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; Dietrich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ Pt@@ K , are particularly vulnerable children . &quot;
&quot; a recently published study of TU Munich , however , proves that every fifth Syrian refugee community is trau@@ mat@@ ised in Germany . &quot;
&quot; who is suffering from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffer from so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart ras@@ ive and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe terr@@ ability and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; preventing the symptoms chron@@ ically would be necessary , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ically ill refugees have been psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; indeed , psych@@ ologically ill people seeking asylum seek@@ ers can provide a psych@@ otherapy treatment for psych@@ otherapy , but processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , social workers and doctors who are not educated for mental illness would decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this lead to mis@@ estim@@ ations frequently , says mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream a dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst falls on the traditions of the cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the aim is to attract any age group into the banks of fascinating acro@@ b@@ atics , wildlife dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst charges into the ring on the brick @-@ mine to dream .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine , without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , student teacher and Juni@@ or@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current production stage .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst .
so the gift to inspiration is the family thus in the blood .
&quot; for us , it is important to take away people from their everyday sins and take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Le@@ af@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan city , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities along the nearly 3 000 km long tour , this fl@@ air can now be experienced . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo . the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn family attracts the audience with joke and charm .
and the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to loose the cube . &quot;
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify themselves with these words .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon , the acro@@ b@@ atics of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst is fascin@@ ated by fingers and ar@@ acts . &quot;

60 Emplo@@ ye@@ es from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
griev@@ ances in the post@@ ure of cir@@ c@@ els are only too often subject to different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also gives a stand , &quot; Is it not good for our animals , it also doesn &apos;t go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match unit .
&quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artic@@ els , as they are called , is being read out after the possibility of every wish of your eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; don &apos;t feel comfortable , I don &apos;t want to ring it to the ring . &quot;
so the first commandment is : good for the animals .
&quot; the family Pro@@ bst is particularly proud of her zeb@@ ra jum@@ bo , a combination of a sh@@ et@@ landed P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare . &quot;
&quot; the two animals have lived together eight years in a enclosure , and nothing has happened . &quot;
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was &quot; said &apos; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the cir@@ cus , but it is the unique mascot of the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is safe , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 spectators ? we always give our best and are with a perfect heart . &quot;
the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst ( 17 to 20 September daily ) invites its ideas from 17 to 20 September .

&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the Falls spread rapidly about social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament also has been clou@@ ded by the alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition , that they have been anonymous to death threats and warned against Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech by Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , they struck him , and during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament , the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opponents have received SMS messages on their mobile phones that they warned against Mr. Mu@@ gab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalist after Mu@@ gab@@ es . &quot;

Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to invest 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; for this year , HP is divided into two listed companies and share the computer and printers business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected capacity reduction goes to a pressure of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures are a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ chairman and Chief Executive , who should direct the unit after separation . &quot;
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise is becoming smaller and stronger than the HP is today and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of shops that support companies in transition to a new style of business &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has an annual turnover of more than $ 50 billion and is to deliver an unprecedented , integrated advanced technology solutions for companies , such as the company &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University , Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to establish electrical systems , and the Palo Alto garage is &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has gone through massive restructuring in order to handle the revers@@ al of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC producer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on belief that narrow @-@ focused companies bring a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal &apos;s captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that te@@ amm@@ ate just need to stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the past Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; W@@ enger stressed against Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it wasn &apos;t until September and as long as its rehabilitation is running , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is safe to miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of its history , his participation in the next summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the great dis@@ grace at this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing during the pre@@ season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
it is a bone that healed not well .
this is not a major matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in association with his u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but as W@@ enger too , there is the associated risk of other injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an un@@ pleasant pattern .
Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd. has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in just 65 out of Arsen@@ y 157 flying players in the last five seasons , too . &quot;
the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League events in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 .
&quot; W@@ enger accepts the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the level of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you return from an injury , you have a gra@@ zing time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and fight force , &quot; W@@ enger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he gets through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday and W@@ enger is a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín , and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , meaning that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta start to start Art@@ eta . &quot;
W@@ enger is also starting with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance , and the players who need it to indul@@ ge a small tre@@ ble break , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al &apos;s favor@@ ites are left due to group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the slots with the largest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after 41 games following the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been launched .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday , while the Richter scale was 3,2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; W@@ enger is the opinion that the arsen@@ al has drawn the apprenticeship from the past season with the Champions League chapter in Monaco , and remains driven far from far hope to conduct the association with its first European ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said W@@ enger . &quot;
the arsen@@ al never worked in the arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the Com@@ edy show that grants us serious infections about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to join himself , now more desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ mor@@ nings under young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ icles . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aign against Living Mis@@ er@@ pen@@ ile ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a her@@ ed@@ itary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of man , with the aim of turning the culture into question , seek help to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students with depres@@ sive symptoms , noted that if the suffering had a sufficient percentage of friends with &quot; healthy atmosphere , &quot; doubled the chances of recovery . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritu@@ ally healthy friends supports the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , one must first have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of social media , communications , with its main focus on substance , the in@@ fertility is often more important than an important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to be strong , fun , and successful to appear , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are called excessive values ; money , image , social status , everything related to costs in@@ tr@@ ins@@ stic values - our inner lon@@ ging for personal development and friendship that affect our spiritual health much more profound . &quot;
&quot; and like a video game inventor , billi@@ on@@ aire declared recently , money can &apos;t really buy luck . &quot;
the beauty in Friends was that these focus was on the head .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in football watching in cozy S@@ ans and the nostal@@ gia of Ross after Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can return to each case even if they are often returning to explore completely their emotions . &quot;
&quot; as one employee of the phone past@@ oral care I declared to me : &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ confident has showed me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us , are often not able to talk to friends . &quot;
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll get right &quot; &quot; has tremendous effects , like feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when you are talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that come to me in mind when trying to offer long @-@ term struggle mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so very my objective out@@ si@@ der status via the phone number the people in eye look of desp@@ air also may help , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest with the celebration of the day completely re@@ designed back@@ drop , why don &apos;t you take your friends to drink a drink in Central Per@@ k with this weekend . &quot;
&quot; or even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks anyone only sitting around , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 236 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
meets Maria in order to help PS@@ G to cereb@@ ral Malmö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Edinburgh in his hits against Malmö .
di Maria met in the Champions League at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps to move to Malmö .
here are the game report and the response to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Edinburgh , Cav@@ ani took part in Paris to celebrate the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö at the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in less than four minutes after the launch of the Champions League Deb@@ it &apos;s debut as PS@@ G players who led the French master to their way , but thereafter it missed a number of opportunities before it increased its lead when Cav@@ ani got a head ball@@ gate in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Sch@@ acht@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A requires Paris a strong start to the Swedish champion , since it does not only stri@@ ve for the quali@@ fications for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ laps , but an improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points they didn &apos;t get the classi@@ fications of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics , was later in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the club , which he already started his illustr@@ ating career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or downhill in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to cause problems and look back , even when there are certain things we need to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; that is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we &apos;ve won , although I regret it was not yet another or two other goals have achieved . &quot;
&quot; according to his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , the weekend will return a 2 : 2 un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was em@@ powered by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man called PS@@ G on the next level in Europe , when he ran ag@@ ulated in the last month of Manchester United , before he went to Johan Wil@@ and finished in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would win a major victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic was hit by a play @-@ off to reach this stage , appeared in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was going to be excited with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed away from Kevin Tra@@ ction P@@ posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they fain@@ ted a bit in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes settled on , with some mis@@ chie@@ fs and poor conditions , not least by Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was first pat@@ ron@@ ed in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ bo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; despite this , he proved a great deal of skill , when he turned his players to play , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic at which Di Maria was transformed into a shooting , which was diver@@ ted by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours @-@ brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus generated six of the highest end of the season after Bor@@ ou@@ mo@@ vic had caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; it closed down all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to David Lu@@ iz hit the final result before the Au@@ ze@@ qu@@ ill Lav@@ e@@ zzi passed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwe@@ gi@@ ans said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have played only in the Swedish League , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the quali@@ fications do not range . &quot;
hat AB in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 from moving to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; some years ago , the FC Bayern stood shortly before the commitment of Spain Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight time Spanish champion , three times trop@@ al@@ ers , four times champion league champion , two times champion champion , two times champion champion , a time world champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and switched to al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi is now telling that he was already standing before departure from Barcelona in 2008 . &quot;
one told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell myself .
&quot; then Madrid won everything that we had nothing , &quot; he tells . &quot;
and this registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was a quot@@ ation of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; men wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the place in the summer of 2008 . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the change occurred not .
and the decisive factor is for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has captured Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under contract , and I played a great European Championship . &quot;
P@@ EP told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not introduce the team without me .
&quot; with that he worked out . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of the Champions League against Bavaria about the entire distance on the lawn , the red came off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the end of the royal class triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro @-@ American filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown , during a discussion on the variety and said she would not be needed behind the scenes . &quot;
during a sequence of Sunday Night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light broke down the experienced actor Brown as this was the need for alternative perspectives and in regards to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the elected hub of the project .
&quot; if we talk about variety , then do it in the cast of the film and not at the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Brown warned , with parti@@ e un@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay , &quot; when the actors of the actors come from The Mar@@ tian . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined forces Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about it - who will also be the director - like her to treat the harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and it &apos;s a sp@@ line that will be beaten by its white im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , who was interested in the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for direc@@ ting rights to the film , Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the Social Media explo@@ ded on Dam@@ ask comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pressed his rage over the clip , in that he wrote &apos; Matt Dam@@ on &apos; speaks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - it SO W@@ I@@ KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ que@@ urs since its release . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on comments are at a point of time , at the precise rac@@ tical representation in the media at the fore@@ front of social discussion . &quot;
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ emen , the movement of Black Li@@ ves , ex@@ ron@@ ged and urged the authorities , and discri@@ min@@ ating practices against far@@ my@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; in February , singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warrior &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport@@ sman Fred Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athl@@ ete who won the American Ninja Warrior Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million by home .
&quot; the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants who could close all stages of his obst@@ acle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last purpose , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time when he was the first athl@@ ete , who finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge every three seconds faster , which made him vic@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or ever had my life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
so very suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how that &apos;s ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent we@@ ed , led himself with The Hollywood reporter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course of the course , not just any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , money goes to the quick@@ est person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , one receives one of the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price , and life is changing , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think it swe@@ eps over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
the crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off told me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I &apos;m glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac had felt as felt when she was mixed the roles .
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an A@@ ge Season being filmed in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers passed through Minnesota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
earlier they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball . today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but they played perfectly on Tuesday against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins pro@@ filed a chance to climb up a second half of the Houston branch for the second American League Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one night , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so difficult to seize on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ m . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon led his early offensive support , when Detroit lasted three times in the first two lines , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times into the 1 / 3 lines and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ seye of each game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit @-@ game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has pushed the perc@@ ussions well , &quot; &quot; said out@@ set . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( percussion training ) , looked much better from the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it right into the game . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the seventh year at the end of the seventh flight , T@@ wins had her best chance to come back into play again . &quot;
the F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks reached a var@@ ie@@ gated , and Simon finished his second base eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was running the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with two @-@ run ro@@ ok@@ ie Miguel S@@ ano , which has been tied to the right @-@ run tri@@ w Ver@@ h@@ agen . &quot;
&quot; with a couple of buyers and the finale in the second , Ver@@ h@@ agen issued the third B@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was that in the Major League leading 27th time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe has a double play &quot;
&quot; after having added an Insurance run at the end of the ninth time , it wrought a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the level 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , in three Pit@@ ches there are three Pit@@ ches for the fifth S@@ ava . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ mov@@ able Phil Hughes .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers were awarded three R@@ uns in the first two lines against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who was canc@@ eled before the game from the po@@ aching part because he had been pur@@ ging for more than a month because of a back @-@ suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I had wished for , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt host@@ ess when I started to release myself , that I would make some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the lead @-@ off bat@@ ter , H@@ IM received a single at the Second Bas@@ Col@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out walk from J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the game to Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z gave his 0 @-@ 21 success series with Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single at the right side , yet another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game , as he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tig@@ ers returned in the second one One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he was not specially sm@@ itten , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hughes was found in a Pit@@ ch Count , didn &apos;t score points in the third inning before he was replaced by the rail@@ ing @-@ handed in A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hughes , we found three hits with six hits and a walk with four d@@ ke@@ out . &quot;

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria a option
&quot; Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , head of the Munich Security Conference , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility to take part in Syria . &quot;
&quot; I believe that the definite decision about military action plans must not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective directions . &quot;
four years ago it was glad that the cup of a military involvement has passed in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict broke down in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;

Austria controls in southern and Eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has also introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Internal Affairs , Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared the Austrian TV ORF ( Austrian TV ORF ) to be sent back to Hungary on Tuesday evening . &quot;
also Germany did not send refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it has already been meeting between the general manager for public safety and representatives in Germany . &quot;
they have not given concrete figures and refer to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the last days , tens of thousands of thousands of refugees came from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann now requested a special summit on the next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany began on Sunday with temporary border controls began .
the EU states have not yet able to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
&quot; the ministers of the Interior will want to take a new intake of another 120 000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee agency in Germany , the Federation plans to support countries with the first absorption and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday evening , the Con@@ federation will quit the alliance with the international ministers on Thursday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people , the protection bri@@ dging , be@@ amed these also . &quot;
but those who have not lead to lead could not remain in Germany as well .
this idea would have been con@@ sensu@@ al in the round .
&quot; the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or stressed , the state as a whole would have to overcome a &quot; huge force stri@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
desper@@ ate refugees have meanwhile arrived on the Balkans route .
Hungary had closed its 175 kilometres long border in Serbia on Tuesday .

&quot; the shell @-@ color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about the fruit , so also green man@@ os can taste delicious . &quot;
&quot; they should be stored at room temperature , and will be consumed within a few days . &quot;

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there are now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino in the presence of the municipal President Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino , a previously famous place in the park was christen@@ ed on the Opp@@ io Hill &apos;s name on the name of the German reform@@ ist . &quot;
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was made for the Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome by the Association of Protestant Ch@@ urches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , a priest of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome , remin@@ ded that the Protest@@ ants were living in the city of pop@@ es more than a minority in the secret of their faith . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , there will be visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome may be welcome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for a few months in Rome .
he encouraged the city as a promised sin@@ c@@ ism .
his negative impressions will be encouraged in his future fight against Rome in his later struggle .

hammer Artist invested three years in the Bible &apos;s personal interpretation
Jesus with the ( gilded ) thorn @-@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar is painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has updated the introduction and bi@@ ds .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt who painted in 150 moti@@ ves his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations Bi@@ blical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but , at all , is by no means equal with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adjusted on the respective topics , it may well be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project for which he has made a sub@@ jective @-@ artistic selection from the many subject areas of &quot; book all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; those are cycles that de@@ vote topics like cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fath@@ er@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; so spontan@@ e@@ ously he has fascin@@ ated several partners here : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its main focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author of Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who is based on the basis of painting with the respective Bible places . &quot;
it has been interpreted by Ot@@ mar Alt selected Bible and thus translated into current connections . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; it is nestled between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who puts his own personal thoughts on their respective situation here . &quot;
the je@@ wel has gold .
&quot; so the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows for a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
that is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emot@@ ion was ultimately wi@@ ped out for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; then the education took place with the pi@@ stock , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &quot; remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to step up , trying to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to help art too much more in rapid life : &quot; the perception of imag@@ ery is influenced by advertising , and that is noisy . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being overcome there .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have a bit mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants that the viewer can aband@@ on the images , &quot; let them aband@@ on themselves , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday in the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; that always has been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst &quot; : &quot; I like he understands as he understands . &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t care to encomp@@ assing the Bible completely , but chosen for him important , also mysterious themes . &quot;
&quot; that was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; here is the pictures that explains the text only &quot; . &quot; be it a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans se@@ duc@@ ers from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for carrots both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
&quot; some of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented at an exhibition in an exhibition that will be inaugurated on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
building start for BM@@ X rail
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned and scul@@ pted for a round course : one year later , almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was completed . &quot;
&quot; pris@@ ons in politics and administration led up , especially for the residents that would not toler@@ ate the rail . &quot;
&quot; down hill deported , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
the approval will be in October . the first community of Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock could now inform the children &apos;s youth and youth committee .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; then without further &quot; &quot; break &quot; &quot; should be started with the works when the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment to refugees
&quot; DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees from the year 2019 , the Bundesliga was made a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football respon@@ ds to the right @-@ heated location in Germany and secu@@ res the policy to address the problems of the incoming problems .
&quot; I think it is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; nobody can say in principle , nothing goes wrong with me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must find every single interest in the grip on this theme , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to inten@@ sively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday in the Chancell@@ ery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ uz and the ch@@ anc@@ ell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
&quot; the soccer could be , and I can help . &quot;
&quot; however , the decisive turn@@ around must make policy . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the German soccer federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; of four years . &quot;
&quot; we ensured through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung , that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; stated Nier@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already this weekend , 36 pro@@ filing will make a clear sign if they are calling on the left tri@@ ck@@ et@@ le instead of the usual Spon@@ sor@@ ship logos ( Hermes ) the relief printing &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make sure that everybody can help , where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports chief Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler from the &quot; &quot; Picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and called the project as &quot; self intel@@ li@@ gi@@ bility . &quot; &quot;
&quot; refugee &apos;s drama goes everyone , nobody shall go away . &quot;
&quot; we have to offer soccer players , no , we need to use our radiation , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have already been so incredible to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ omin@@ hei@@ ms Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character in the League . &quot;
&quot; to the EM trials against Hungary on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large community of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license agreements had launched their own projects is great .
&quot; so great , that small and smallest associations are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for the welcome &quot; , &quot; which we spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Association joint with the DF@@ B range and the German government presents 300 000 euros each for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; related to Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; he is almost ag@@ grav@@ ated , I was hungry , he dra@@ gged out to the road - that he told us so much last week , &quot; &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ ordin@@ ator Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could re@@ prove his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; he said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager would be busy during the meeting and &quot; fully @-@ employed . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Donn@@ a Edition ) that he will return to Germany in October and will continue to launch the software .
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I had all the time in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to tell him with such a personal history to the public , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen so much . &quot;
&quot; it is important to get up again , if you please . &quot;
McLaren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ ussen besides ...
Magn@@ ussen t@@ wit@@ ched a proper picture and explained the injury he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he comes as a result of rising in Singapore on the weekend , as little as reserve tickets for both tri@@ bal pilgrims Fernando Alonso and J@@ enson Button , in Japan , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
football : Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against Kras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us will definitely break in the first group of the Europa League . &quot;
the national player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kras@@ no@@ dar ( 19.00 / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t take back on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundesliga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach made open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his regular eleven spot on the Re@@ us location . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ ke@@ over position .
Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is therefore taking place in the square of the dedicated no@@ b@@ ender &apos;s novel Ag@@ ki .
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , the soccer player praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; whether wheat f@@ eller in the future is used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ch@@ el made it open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , it will also deny the second game . &quot;
&quot; the search statement by te@@ amm@@ ate Re@@ us , that the Fin@@ al@@ entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europe League must be the goal of re@@ tra@@ ce@@ able the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l : &quot; that is why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robots for Germany : government wants to roll for Germany
Germany is expected to be the German government &apos;s change in the change of the car technology .
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided to bring a strategy paper from the home of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fore@@ sees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt announced on Wednesday at the entrance to the Motor Show from a &quot; new mobile age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated , net@@ worked drive will increase traffic safety and ensure less stress , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also aims to discuss the theme with his counterpart out of the G7 , the IAA also with representatives of industry . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Strategic Sector emphas@@ izes the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a generous donation to digital radio stations . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there is currently a test stretch on the speed@@ way 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; by adding the driver &quot; no additional body @-@ risks , &quot; the German government wants to verify the legal framework conditions &quot; and , &quot; where necessary to custom@@ ize the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to put an international level in Germany that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is raised from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Federal Government wants to stand up for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees people as drivers . &quot;
&quot; when automated driving takes over , the car will take the lead , the driver will more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras , which capture the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economy , automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dangerous vehicles are expected on public roads &quot; only far to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value added in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study forecasts up to some 8.4 billion euros by 2025 . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of the vehicle can lead to greater safety and efficiency , &quot; said SPD traffic @-@ negoti@@ ator S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability upon accidents and safety of personal data , however , must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA pre @-@ set survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ative effort DE@@ K@@ RA comes to the result that only eight percent of Germans believe that aut@@ on@@ ome cars come into the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those surveyed by 2025 anticip@@ ates autonomous vehicles in the US 33 percent . &quot;
now the drivers in Germany are not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; after a digital negoti@@ ation elevation , only seven percent would agree , control over the entire drive on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent of this kind can be seen on the free@@ way , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
a good man would leave the car to control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team and double release at table tennis @-@ EM

the final decision should be at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo entitled &quot; , &quot; Alex@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head said during the European teaching process in Düsseldorf . &quot;
B@@ oll has been at this point on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed Spon@@ sor@@ enter@@ min in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the dis@@ advantage , we are now no longer declared a clear favorite , &quot; explained individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

&quot; at that time , Timo Scheider also become f@@ oul , and we are European champion . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the World Ran@@ kings . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier feels too old to become an en@@ f@@ ant
it is a mixture of quite a fashion show and a wax com@@ eback . designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; the highlights : man@@ ne@@ quin , which are frigh@@ tening thanks to video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creation of the French designer , among others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits to the great Star of the fashion scene - and that he was in a skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t say any more today that I am the en@@ f@@ ant of the Haute C@@ out@@ ure , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it was very easy , and meanwhile it is real , &quot; &quot; said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for visitors to the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is on 18 September at the Kuns@@ thalle of Hyp@@ o @-@ Cultural Foundation , it is a good luck that the fashion designer rests at a show over his person . &quot;
&quot; it was actually he said : &quot; for me , an exhibition was a bit &apos; sort of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
&quot; the impressive collection had already been in Montreal , in Montreal and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly an instant work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed a training .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not rebuilt , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed joint work which was operated for much effort : in order to har@@ ass the pupp@@ ets , an example of St@@ yl@@ ist was involved . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have lost 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the beginning of the Oktober@@ fest it was a special ha@@ unt : a leather tro@@ user out@@ fit with Kor@@ s@@ ett .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he always interested in strong women ( &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , &quot; Gaul@@ tier said . &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers old ted@@ dy is in the exhibition to see .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ ious design@@ ations of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he was attracted to his ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , he said . &quot;
his parents have not allowed him to play with a doll .
&quot; dra@@ fted the fashion , he later taught himself . &quot;
&quot; he st@@ ole fashion journ@@ als and saw the designs of other designers , such as Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought the then bought .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but was allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ sible tip as fashion @-@ niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery in and around Pl@@ auen because of making meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered substances and lace worked in large quantities for customers , extending for example to blank@@ ets and Gar@@ d@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; today this alone doesn &apos;t work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the lead screw . &quot;
instead the fashion is important .
&quot; at the beginning of Pl@@ au@@ ener top times , fashion played a larger role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt introduces several examples : top in jewelry and accessories such as bags and with regional costumes .
&quot; the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on the past p@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing product potential . &quot;
&quot; who is not serving in the textile industry in Germany , is no longer on the market . &quot;
they already make up half of these orders .
Mo@@ ve Pl@@ es is together with nine further companies member at the industry association Pl@@ au@@ sible head and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they can carry the registered label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of its turnover is broken . &quot;
private specialist stores and wholesale there is almost no more .
our products can hardly reach customers on this road .
&quot; the bulk materials are presently made much cheaper in Asian countries , almost exclusively about chains . &quot;
&quot; moreover , exports are exported to Russia and the US . &quot;
sufficient reasons thus for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to focus on environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ dery point in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; we have been introducing a quality seal since this year , which shows that we produce ecological and soci@@ ally toler@@ able . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt : &quot; that also refers to the materials used . &quot;
diplom@@ at U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger Out@@ side of the West@@ s@@ Sax@@ on University of Z@@ wick@@ au - speci@@ alis@@ es in the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
&quot; in order to find out the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is an voltage field between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , which need to think above all economic , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design can often be easily varied to keep a customer base . &quot;
&quot; some years ago , Mon@@ i Re@@ uter worked the historical snow @-@ lace fashion designer . &quot;
the machine st@@ acks a few places in some places .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ smith @-@ master in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ h was inspired : &quot; before , I could not start with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener tip . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ lace tip for their jewellery .
&quot; in a elabor@@ ated procedure , they shaped the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify themselves with the theme of Pl@@ au@@ ener top - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies the United States , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers , whose ancestors stayed in place and the surrounding area and want to commem@@ orate the memory . &quot;
&quot; thus , I see my jewelry as the modern ambassador for the pl@@ au@@ ght . &quot;
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; fairy tal@@ es don &apos;t touch it , but Disney still dar@@ es for a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is , according to &quot; Entertainment Weekly , &quot; but not for a revision , but rather a kind of sequ@@ el that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl . &quot;
it &apos;s about the experience of N@@ anny &apos;s family in the ages of the Great Depression in England .
those who play P@@ opp@@ a &apos;s more than 50 years after Julie Andre@@ ws is still un@@ clear .

XI is waiting for opening the economy of bro@@ ader for the world
&quot; the economy must open bro@@ ader after out@@ wards to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on the Tuesday of a group commissioned with the steering of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China ought to deplo@@ y foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business activities , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Bank Group for deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ ups and drive reforms in advance will bring new moment@@ um and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list for the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the resident system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , sectors and companies identified , which will not come into question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as it indicates a major role in the allocation of resources , which guarantees legally governmental business environment and designed the market . &quot;
&quot; the government will also ensure control over those transferred to the company , and ensure that businesses will decide how to carry out their businesses . &quot;
the statement also said that China will permit China borders to explore new models of cross @-@ border business operation and new mechanisms involved in promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policies towards foreign investment and will protect the legal interests of foreign finance and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners to apply a permanent residence permit or the &apos; Green Card &apos; by facil@@ it@@ ating the requirements and application process . &quot;
&quot; guarant@@ e@@ eing the right of lawyers to pract@@ ise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli were also present at the meeting , as reported in one after the statement published by Liu Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in rob@@ bers
&quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ or , thus making consumers a significantly higher dose of damage . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch Consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding employer in the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects associated with industrial and environmental policy are passed with full impact of pregnant and small children , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt von F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt is said to have increased the limit values for large fish at the end of the food chain at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; of 1 to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
big pre@@ dat@@ ors still seem to be so heavily bur@@ dened by mercury that the limit values should not be sold about 50 percent of the cat@@ ches .
&quot; according to dou@@ bling the limit values , only a 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ significant . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attra@@ cting , the EU intends to accelerate the limit values in other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , described this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fish such as car@@ p usually are so low charged that they already retain the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ dic@@ ation in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ of di@@ stra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal that is strong above the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ or .
the Federal Government thus warns that &quot; small amounts may have been produced particularly in the new@@ bor@@ ns of the nervous system . &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry put it on its homepage in regard to the applicable limit values but that a &quot; health haz@@ ar of the general population &quot; is not expected .
mercury is mainly due to the combustion of coal in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ corn compl@@ ains more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of which em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; mercury in f@@ ishings in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube may be &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; &quot; had the &quot; mirror &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , pre @-@ European war@@ nings and mercury in fish have already been related to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
