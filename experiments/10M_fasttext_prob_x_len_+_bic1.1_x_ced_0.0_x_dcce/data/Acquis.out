&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 , or at any other time , between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) All Member State can provide the payments before the above dates .
&quot; the ste@@ et@@ ter assumes according to the usual methods of the organization about dis@@ proportionate draw on the cash or school , in order to cover the expenses for the promotional loan and the special interaction within an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the grant of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided according to the terms and conditions of the EEC : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service to the country and its further credit transfer capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ity without allo@@ wan@@ ces ; and
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the countries concerned must be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; every promotional loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly paying development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral College ) , regardless of whether it is assumed for the exchange program of organisation or not , according to the procedures and practices that will be approved for the appropriate means of organisation funded development loans , being approved and managed by the letter b ) of pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the resources of the Special Fund must not be bound in lieu of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which in the context of a loan or credit , has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special companies are subject to the same deposit conditions specified by the Organization for Development Bank ; they are therefore refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; however , the loan can be provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies . &quot;
&quot; however , amounts for the payment of these bones are to be carried out immediately to the organization that retains them . &quot;
&quot; any special loan can be determined by a separate intestinal agreement between the beneficiaries , and the ste@@ ward , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from any particular transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are produced in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , members of the organization are determined and which may be provided by the administrator at the time of the loan granted . &quot;

&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) . &quot;

&quot; the total quantity named under number 2 is fixed , with the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community on 23 000 tons of batt@@ le@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community takes everything in order to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ ent@@ age on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community takes place in order to prevent the sales of interfer@@ ing bodies in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of the paragraph of Argent@@ in@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el - and dis@@ g@@ ums not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this Agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of equipment or other conveyor measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ bs , as well as for the slaugh@@ tering of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , are in line with existing international commitments and take into account the traditional share of community trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible in a manner that is compatible with Article XVI of G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Articles 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the design and application of articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of General customs and trade agreement . &quot;

a concentration of human blood @-@ blood cells is a unity of human blood that has been removed from the most part of the sculpture .
&quot; it contains all the red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood @-@ cell components can be present or may be partially removed . &quot;
&quot; the fluid content of the concentrations consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water rig@@ ation solution , which was assigned to the distance of the plas@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cell is to amount between 65 and 75 % of the total volume ; however , the higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so is the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing processes must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the order must be performed using a steri@@ le , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;

&quot; human drying plasma is stored in an nit@@ ric atmosphere , or in air @-@ empty space in a steri@@ le , closed bottle below off of any micro @-@ organisms and after possibility of any moisture ; it is to be protected from light and to keep on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human gra@@ ins and fac@@ tions from the human plastic rot@@ ate are preparations made from the protein component that consist of approximately 60 % of the total prot@@ ector of the human whole blood .
&quot; without regard to whether the end product will be cur@@ sed or dry , the supplement has to be heated for the addition of an appropriate stabil@@ iser in the final vessel for 10 hours on 60 Â° Â± 0.5 C , in order to enable the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ cular shep@@ herds . &quot;
&quot; in preparation for human res@@ ellers , at least 95 % of the mass of existing proteins , must be converted . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin may be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is dried , it must contain at least 950 mg protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; the Group is made up of human plastic as a solution , it must have a total prot@@ ein@@ ation between 45 and 50 grams per liter . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ agents used currently may contain compounds of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective share , the others are the necessary means to strengthen the effectiveness and preservation of the stability of the repository . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective portion in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each of the vessels there is a black on white label in English and French , which includes the following information : 1 . name and ad@@ ress of the manufacturer , &quot;
