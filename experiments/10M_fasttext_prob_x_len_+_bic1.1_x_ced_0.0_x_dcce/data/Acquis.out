&quot; the organisation guides documents from which any transfer , and if necessary , the re@@ application of the backup measures will be presented to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; aims at nuclear material that is to be used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramics are agreed , so the backup should be termin@@ ated with the organization of such use of material , under which circumstances the backup measures will be termin@@ ated in accordance with this material in regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the ker@@ material is not used during the duration of non @-@ employment of the backup measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear bul@@ ders .
&quot; ( B ) The organization and the community shall meet a regulation , that the security measures intended in this agreement will not be used for such a long time , as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as long as possible , these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will again be applied once again , as soon as the core material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization will be present in the state and the composition of this material in the concerned state or the respective states and on the transfer of such material from that state or states .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as time @-@ consuming and dis@@ agreements for the coverage , but does not include endor@@ sement or an in@@ sider knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the decisive use of the core material . &quot;

the aim of the securing measures established in this Convention is the timely discovery of the significant significant quantities of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear jum@@ pers for un@@ familiar purposes as well as the deter@@ rent of such a branch off at the risk of early detection .
&quot; when the bill is set in Article 28 fixed target , the material reserve is used as a backup of fundamental importance , combining with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as an important supple@@ mental action . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the review by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for each material image area , which is not listed for a specified period of time , indicating the most accurate material conditions for the indicated seas . &quot;
&quot; in the implementation of their reporting , the organization makes for Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for core materials according to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material zones .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following kind of use and , as far as required , fores@@ ee@@ able as they are determined in supple@@ mental agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a Me@@ ß@@ system to determine the amounts of preserv@@ ated , trans@@ vers@@ ed , lost , lost , or other way out of the stock of nuclear material and the quantities ; &quot;

a ) special don@@ able material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such key material is re@@ portable , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric run by Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; if the community is delivered to the Organization of nuclear material that otherwise backup measures would be subject to this Convention , provided that the entire , due to this article in the states of the core materi@@ alist will no longer be considered . &quot;
a ) a kilo@@ gram of special p@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an increase of 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran , calculated by a dissemin@@ ation of its weight with the fi@@ ff@@ ing square of the rich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten m@@ etr@@ ian tons of natural uran and de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ an@@ ium en@@ rich@@ ment with an increase of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;

&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1 . January 1979 , or at any other time , between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account the deadlines required for the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) All Member State can provide the payments before the above dates .
&quot; the ste@@ et@@ ter assumes according to the usual methods of the organization about dis@@ proportionate draw on the cash or school , in order to cover the expenses for the promotional loan and the special interaction within an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the grant of this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided according to the terms and conditions of the EEC : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ; &quot;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service to the country and its further credit transfer capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ity without allo@@ wan@@ ces ; and
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the countries concerned must be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; every promotional loan serves to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly paying development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral College ) , regardless of whether it is assumed for the exchange program of organisation or not , according to the procedures and practices that will be approved for the appropriate means of organisation funded development loans , being approved and managed by the letter b ) of pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the resources of the Special Fund must not be bound in lieu of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which in the context of a loan or credit , has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special companies are subject to the same deposit conditions specified by the Organization for Development Bank ; they are therefore refundable at ten years of age in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; however , the loan can be provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies . &quot;
&quot; however , amounts for the payment of these bones are to be carried out immediately to the organization that retains them . &quot;
&quot; any special loan can be determined by a separate intestinal agreement between the beneficiaries , and the ste@@ ward , in which the origin of the funds is stated in particular . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from any particular transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are produced in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , members of the organization are determined and which may be provided by the administrator at the time of the loan granted . &quot;

&quot; the community takes everything in order to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ ent@@ age on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community takes place in order to prevent the sales of interfer@@ ing bodies in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of the paragraph of Argent@@ in@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el - and dis@@ g@@ ums not under@@ mines . &quot;

a concentration of human blood @-@ blood cells is a unity of human blood that has been removed from the most part of the sculpture .
&quot; it contains all the red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood @-@ cell components can be present or may be partially removed . &quot;
&quot; the fluid content of the concentrations consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water rig@@ ation solution , which was assigned to the distance of the plas@@ mas . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cell is to amount between 65 and 75 % of the total volume ; however , the higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so is the approximate percentage of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing processes must be done under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the order must be performed using a steri@@ le , closed system and only by pressure . &quot;
