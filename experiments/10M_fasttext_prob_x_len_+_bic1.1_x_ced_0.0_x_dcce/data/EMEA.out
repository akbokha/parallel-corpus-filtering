&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Associ@@ ations report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the studies assessed , as the committee on human pharmac@@ ov@@ ents ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or their treatment , please read the package board ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt z@@ enges ( tablets that can solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to capture ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injections ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. E@@ res thinking and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things which are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which the patients can have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ loading ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy becomes the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes , and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied to a fast control of disturbed anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces when the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ tion or melting pills in patients where the eggs are prepared by tablets difficulty . &quot;
&quot; patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines which are as well as A@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted for the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably appears above all as &quot; particip@@ atory ag@@ onist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters works to enable the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; da dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin with schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its recur@@ rence is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , preventing recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of injection resolution has been compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia , or similar diseases , compared to increased unrest , over a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was made over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ oper@@ dol , in a different study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , recur@@ rence of 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabil@@ ised by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of contrac@@ tion injection resolution has been compared to a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; for all studies the change in symptoms experienced by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients , which were involved in the treatment . &quot;
the company also carried out studies in order to examine how the body absorbed the melting of the water and the solution to the one resor@@ bed ( decreasing ) .
&quot; in the two studies with the injection resolution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in use for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy fet@@ tered also up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes with previously treated patients , and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms stra@@ ined unrest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to capture ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ pyramid , headaches , bl@@ ur@@ red secre@@ tion ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , gra@@ dation ( dro@@ pping ) , sof@@ tening ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , sof@@ tening ( dro@@ pping ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleeping disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from mid @-@ severe to severe man@@ ic episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the Ottoman episodes had to weigh on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injections in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ ban@@ ces in patients with schizophren@@ ia , or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable to over@@ l@@ ull the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission signed the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for the in@@ transport of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new Ottoman episode in patients , which had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses of a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mono@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ anist should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased addiction risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular disease , conditions that are applied for hyp@@ ot@@ ony medicines or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acoustic and mal@@ ignant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : clinical studies conducted a year or less , there were occasional reports on during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; when compared with a AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of relap@@ sing dy@@ nasty should consider to reduce the dose or vom@@ iting the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms resulting in a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be dis@@ credited . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cr@@ amps in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are linked with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients had treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased mort@@ g@@ isi@@ ko compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for unwanted cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ on@@ ous coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients to allow direct comparisons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored in terms of a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the application of anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , in which weight is known as side @-@ effect , or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nerve system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole are taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the Res@@ or@@ p@@ ect rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is not relevant to a clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , an extremely effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects and therefore similar tin reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; at C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism , the joint application can result with highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma no@@ des compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sible met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other high @-@ effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV @-@ prot@@ ector , should have similar effects and therefore similar tin reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after dismantling of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage should be lifted by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the tin levels before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; clinical studies showed doses from 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ dden morph@@ in@@ an @-@ rati@@ o ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ p@@ hic ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of humans and due to the resulting concerns during animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ otic patients , patients should be warned to use dangerous machines , including power vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following side effects occur more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than below placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the below side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks entered patients with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole , with a total lower incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ell , D@@ yst@@ ine and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who were treated with semi @-@ operated i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under semi @-@ operating treatment .
&quot; in another study , over 12 weeks incidence of EPS amoun@@ ted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term basis phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS increases to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo patients . &quot;
&quot; a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters arose , revealed not medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine ph@@ opho@@ bic kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and over their appearance also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ u@@ kul@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch of the market , un@@ intended or inten@@ tionally super@@ do@@ si@@ ties with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the effectiveness of a bun@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole , but it is unlikely that Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis has to be beneficial since Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole has a high plastic loss . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partial di@@ ag@@ onal effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - to ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to the alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ gen and the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
&quot; with gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , the Pos@@ it@@ inary tomato tomato showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the bond of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ ands , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant increase of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a semi @-@ controlled trial , 52 the proportion of Respon@@ si@@ cal patients , who held a talk on the study of study , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and semi @-@ operating 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from the measurement of measurement , which were defined as secondary study destinations , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - anti @-@ explosion scale , showed a significantly stronger better recovery than half @-@ operating len@@ i@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction of relap@@ ses showed up by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an eye @-@ controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study in schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients covered and in which the primary study of &apos; weight loss &apos; was included in significant less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a opposite placebo over three weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole against placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ing and active @-@ controlled mono@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole showed a comparison of placebo excessive effectiveness in week 3 and an entertaining effect that was comparable to that of lithium or half @-@ operating surgery in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole reported in a week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia on such as lithium or semi @-@ operating i@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ bi @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics which are partly over 2 weeks not on licensing or Val@@ pro@@ at mono@@ cul@@ osis in therapeutic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks , followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks of man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission in comparison to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar retreat , primarily in the prevention of a relap@@ se into man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for stretching and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole at approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole at around C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) met@@ abo@@ isi@@ ans over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , there are no differences in the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as demonstrated in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophren@@ ic patients . &quot;
a multi @-@ specific evaluation of the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy pros .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with a number of widespread liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function to the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ po@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to pull conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security strategies , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , reproduction toxicity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and to can@@ cer@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre@@ clinical data could not identify any particular dangers to man . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ological significant effects were observed only at doses or ex@@ positions that have been clearly exceeded with doses or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects encomp@@ assing a dose @-@ dependent ad@@ renal glands ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ ancy ) at rats within 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the average maximum dose @-@ state exposure to 60 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose ( AU@@ C ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been determined as a consequence of the suscep@@ ti@@ ation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ pra@@ z@@ ag ( AU@@ C ) from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( that 1@@ - to 3@@ 1@@ ples of the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independently of the meals .
&quot; patients who have difficulty in the slip of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , you can use the melting tablet alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , in some cases after the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ stic an@@ x@@ ane was examined in a major study on which 4@@ 60 women participated with metastatic breast cancer , from which about three quarters of which used to be a anth@@ rac@@ tor . &quot;
the effect of my@@ an@@ ane ( in all@@ u@@ vit@@ ational or as mono@@ otherapy ) was compared to using a conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drug agent ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 with my@@ stic patients treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients , with conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el contained medicine . &quot;
one considers only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer indicators like time to worsen@@ ing disease and survival no difference between medicines .
&quot; in contrast , patients who previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , with regard to these indicators , that the x@@ ane was more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it may also not be applied to patients , silent or before beginning of treatment low ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ uter figures in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) stated that this medicine was no longer acceptable in patients , in which the first treatment was no longer in@@ quired , more effective than conventional p@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and that it must not be given to other medicines with other medicines to reduce side effects . &quot;
January 2008 entered the European Commission of D@@ ess@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited as a permit for the in@@ transport of my@@ stic an@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
my@@ stic mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease is not displayed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .

male patients should be advised before the treatment of a sperm inspection because through therapy with my@@ stic in@@ fertility there is the possibility of irreversible in@@ fertility .
&quot; N@@ x@@ ane can cause adverse side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequently ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequently ) , which can affect the per@@ tin@@ ence and the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; below are the most common and most important incidents of side effects , which occurred at 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic mamm@@ ali@@ car@@ cin@@ oma performed in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 . &quot;
ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ( at 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dos@@ is@@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ enia has been reported at 71 % of the patients .

P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ fung@@ al @-@ active ingredient that encourages the contrac@@ tion of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the Tub@@ ular indi@@ m@@ eren and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing of their de@@ ol@@ y@@ mer@@ isation .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ul@@ lar network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ any is conve@@ yed in the trans@@ zy@@ t@@ osis of plasma components into the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m and within the frame of in @-@ vit@@ ro studies was proven that the presence of Alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el by the end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells .

this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed to a biological drug is similar to which it is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; Re@@ ference Aid &quot; ) .
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood re@@ funds used in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications , if before the procedure is not possible to expect a blood @-@ blood@@ stream and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , who has experience in treating patients with disease , for which the medicine is indicated . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood@@ stream , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected in a V@@ ene . &quot;
injection can also be made from the patient or its super@@ visor unless they have an appropriate guide .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients who receive chemotherapy , the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ aries should always be in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ite ) at adults or between 9.@@ 5 and 11 g / d@@ l with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are before the treatment to ensure that no Iron deficiency exists , and iron supple@@ mentary should be administered during the entire treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or by giving the body sufficient to the body &apos;s own er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used in front of operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell that was introduced into one gene ( DNA ) , which it serves to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration in a V@@ ene as part of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a V@@ ene inj@@ ected before it was taken either to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continue E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the hem@@ ost@@ al range between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also laid out the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin had been de@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study involving patients suffering caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ ost@@ al values of patients have been converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed , in the same measure as with those patients who continue to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , the patients received an increase from 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / Er@@ yp@@ o , an increase of 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / d@@ l of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ mon@@ est side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ agn@@ ant mig@@ raine headaches and con@@ cre@@ teness . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed should not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating renal problems as further studies are required to ensure that this caused by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union of detection was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; after this knowledge , through the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not acceler@@ ating . &quot;
for tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy should be considered for the assessment of therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ weekly delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who need to be trans@@ verse ) .
if the H@@ B increase is higher than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ dings between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
&quot; the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etine should be based on the benefit of the respective patients , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are envisaged for a larger Elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy the cause of an@@ a@@ emia examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , since they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ lic and vas@@ cular disease , particularly in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be ruled out that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa to patients with a starting @-@ range bell @-@ value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk for post@@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic / vas@@ cular events . &quot;
in several controlled trials there was not proven for epo@@ e@@ ers that they can improve the overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia and l@@ essen the risk of tum@@ ours .

&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in controls and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ osis should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;

there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tum@@ ors who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on the total survival can not be ruled out .
&quot; it is not clear how far these results relate to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ our patients , which are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transferring a hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s under 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the superior data . &quot;

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , it can come within the norm@@ range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in plat@@ el@@ ets , which can be recovered from further treatment . &quot;
your doctor will carry out regular blood tests in order to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ ol@@ y@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fol@@ ly de@@ fici@@ encies , should be considered and treated before the beginning of therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed . &quot;
very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti @-@ inflammatory er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie after mon@@ ate@@ - until years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin sc@@ anned ) Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie , it will break your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and define how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection in a V@@ ene ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of a an@@ a@@ emia because of a kidney disease . &quot;
a high hem@@ ost@@ bell is the risk of having trouble with the heart or the blood vessels and the ster@@ ber@@ isi@@ ko could be increased .
&quot; with increased or increasing pot@@ assium , your doctor can consider a break in treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , until the pot@@ assium can be in norm@@ ative area . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney illness and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or reservoir , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ ost@@ al level does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to this knowledge , through the treatment of blood poverty with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure , kidney failure , the progression of kidney failure is not acceler@@ ating . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ weekly delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the effectiveness of de@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood cells ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dosage accordingly to keep the risk of blood @-@ clearing ( thro@@ mb@@ bot@@ ical event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk was due to the advantages taken from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ab@@ duc@@ ed advantages very carefully , especially if you are an increased risk of thro@@ p@@ ic vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you are an increased risk of thro@@ p@@ ic vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep Ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or pneum@@ atics in the past ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can influence the tumor negative . &quot;
&quot; if you are a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; if your values are too high in the red blood @-@ off ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk of blood @-@ jumping after the surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines / use or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you use Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of suppression of the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor will arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
studies have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system ; for example in cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood poverty ( an@@ emia ) refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks , until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor will possibly arrange regular blood tests to verify the results of treatment and make sure that the drug works correctly and your hem@@ ost@@ al value does not transc@@ end a certain value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses from Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 kg / kg twice weekly , distributed to two equal injections . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after the men@@ opause and in men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have recently suffered a short trau@@ matic envelope such as when falling down ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get will take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with pus@@ hes should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of infection ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can reduce in the three days after in@@ fusion of symptoms such as fever , muscle tissue , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get must be prescribed ap@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , only by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material was used for Z@@ om@@ eta to assess A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; during the first study , almost 8 000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis and it was investigated the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ating and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( any other bis@@ phosph@@ ate ) . &quot;
main indicator of the efficacy was whether the salary of alkal@@ ine ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme that builds up bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal cord in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis medi@@ ate ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients below placebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis , with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ates or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all the bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients are subject to the risk of kidney illness , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ai ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a presents layout material for doctors ready to prescri@@ bing the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis that contains indications of how to use medicines , as well as similar material for patients , in which the drug side effects are explained and advised if they should consult the doctor . &quot;

&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope . &quot;
&quot; patient inform@@ ational package should be provided and the following core message contains : • The Pack@@ ages • contra@@ indication of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , the non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • W@@ ying signs and symptoms of serious side effects • W@@ ann on medical or nursing help &quot;
&quot; treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women • in men with an increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic envelope . &quot;
for treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men is recommended a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
&quot; in case of patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic hips , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to two or more weeks after the operating supply of hip re@@ frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , only by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ te period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 m@@ ally essential calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a recent low @-@ traumati@@ zing case , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ bit@@ or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disorder ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min becomes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a not recommended since limited clinical experiences are available for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to the younger . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age as data is missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there is only limited clinical experience for these patient population .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ cite is before the beginning of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a through adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of customs acid on bone mineral , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ cal@@ cite can develop their maximum usually within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancers , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene ) should be taken before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate correc@@ tive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental attacks , there are no data available whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw market . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the doctor &apos;s doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the frequency of symptoms which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by gift of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of as serious side @-@ effect reported cases of atri@@ al co@@ bs was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 1.3 % ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT , H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Frac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al frac@@ ture between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare drug impacts are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney disorder Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y has been associated with kidney disorder that has been associated to decrease the kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um @-@ cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured against administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
temporary increase in the ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after gift was observed at 1.8 percent of patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of laboratories , the temporary as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic values presented below the normal tail unit ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies treated patients . &quot;
&quot; all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for the prevention of clinical questionn@@ aires after a hip re@@ frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen was on the j@@ aw market occasionally , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( primarily in the ortho@@ don@@ ate ) reports that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates , including customs acid . &quot;
many of these patients had evidence of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients by tooth extraction or other dental attacks .

&quot; in the case of exagger@@ ation that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ cal@@ cite , can be achieved through the gift of bio@@ calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium carbonate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either two mild or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ as &lt; 2.5 or without signs of an existing spine @-@ body .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after one year the frequency of one or several new vert@@ ebr@@ ates ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal cord compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reported a sustained effect over three years , resulting in a around 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar acid , hip , and at the dist@@ al radius , compared to the placebo treatment significant at all time points ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients who were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies of the pelvic floor .
a micro @-@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ ular bone @-@ volume and the preservation of the tra@@ ular bone architecture .

the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the initial value and was kept at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the base value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not measured rout@@ in@@ ely , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the overall duration was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D on the total and Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als at all times .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months in comparison to placebo treatment to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.2 % of the total th@@ ig@@ h and around 4.3 % on the Schengen area .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and with 185 patients the BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical trials in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on placebo .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg customs acid in comparison to intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was proven in two six month studies .
in the combined results for 6 months a similar decrease of pain strength and pain rep@@ airing was observed in comparison to the starting value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ fied by the end of six month &apos;s main study ( upon the therapy ) could be taken into an observ@@ ational phase .

&quot; unique and multiple times lasting 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs acid in 64 patients have the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level decreased rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of customs clearance by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma centr@@ ation against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic substances is unlikely , because customs acid is not metabo@@ li@@ zed with humans , and because they are a watch@@ ful or not a direct and / or irreversible , hydrogen @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;

this results that an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney disorder down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment to customs acid .
there is only limited data for heavy kidney disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance / min ) only limited data is possible for this population .

&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly estrogen that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is made un@@ arranged , which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works , by creating the bone structure again norm@@ alized , thereby creating a normal bone formation and thus gives the bone its strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or have to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you use other medicines / use or have recently taken / applied even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , known from which it is known to the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , together with food and drink , you worry that you can take sufficient fluid according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken down the hat@@ s , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will make two or more weeks after the operating supply of the hip . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg which is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a V@@ ene .
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you may possibly need another dose after one year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions exactly , so that the calcium mirror in your blood in the time after in@@ fusion is not too low . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get can work A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a more than a year , and your doctor will inform you when you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed , Set@@ ting you immediately with your doctor or hospital in order to arrange a new date . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a Falls , you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next doctor reviews and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects in connection with the first in@@ fusion very often occur ( with more than 30 % of patients ) are however less frequent after subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
&quot; fever and sho@@ ok , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions up to the application ; usually 24 h at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C is not exceeded . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic rec@@ ess case , in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to make two or more weeks after the operating supply of ho@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be supplied adequate with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the quick inser@@ tion of the effect of customs acid on bone mineral , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ cal@@ cite can develop whose maximum usually within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient supply of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently exp@@ ired low @-@ traumati@@ zing case , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ bit@@ or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; a summary of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Associ@@ ations report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , in which the studies assessed , as the Committee on Human@@ Promotion ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos are used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ ational medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the account treatment except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ant or insulin is reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body can be improved better and the blood sugar level decreases , thus allowing type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of accounts in Tri@@ ple@@ therapy was examined ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants , in addition they received either an account or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied ha@@ em@@ ine , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar consumption at the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the triple therapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for an existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values at 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin has been studied in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients , the accounts in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients , which also took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with accounts were visual dys@@ functions , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( erot@@ ica ) , weight gain and hypo@@ cris@@ y ( reduced sensitivity to irritation ) . &quot;
&quot; accounts may not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic ket@@ ac@@ aci@@ dity - ac@@ id@@ sp@@ aci@@ dity - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( with the only use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients should serve , in which met@@ form@@ in is not displayed . &quot;
October 2000 the European Commission signed the European Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for approval of the entry of accounts in the entire European Union .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved , and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate in insulin and in which met@@ form@@ ality is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; for use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; patients who are endangered by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. former coron@@ ary heart attack ) or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardiovascular reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency to gain weight gain and oils when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency showed that , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x surface of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver illness may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
if the AL@@ T mirror up to 3 times the upper limit of the standard area increases are the liver enzymes as soon as possible once again .
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms developed on a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , waiter @-@ curing , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker res@@ n , are the liver enzymes . &quot;
the decision whether treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued by the pre@@ trial of the trial parameters of clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dos@@ is@@ tran@@ ge weight is detected , which can move from fat deposits and in some cases associated with an hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a bun@@ ge@@ al , under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a minor reduction in the middle hem@@ ost@@ al glo@@ binary levels ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes have been observed in comparative @-@ controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ al gland by 3.@@ 6 @-@ 4.@@ 1 % ) and to a lesser extent also in patients under sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ants and insulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ al gland by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity , in patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin @-@ combination therapy with insulin is obtained , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after market launch was reported under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ e@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the appearance of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , but prescribed doctors should report on the possibility of a bro@@ o@@ cular disease ; a suitable oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone brood from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the cran@@ ial incidence amoun@@ ted to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the women of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision drug . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this entry is the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ ro@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulting in a lowering of AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ishes in pregnancy , hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance of the parent and thereby dimin@@ ishes the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the Federal Statisti@@ cal growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rarely &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( of present data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the trac@@ ted inde@@ xes of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ en@@ sti@@ ces occurred over the tri@@ ght of the surface of the standard sector as often as below placebo , but less common than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
in a Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular illness was the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than on placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch of the market , rarely has reported over heart failure among Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone brood , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with compar@@ atively @-@ related groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years running pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days were no symptoms . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core @-@ key recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ G ) , which results in the animal model to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and boo@@ sts the periph@@ eral glucose in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study conducted with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time until after@@ math of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment , a blood sugar was able to maintain ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) through Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated under Gli@@ dec@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ e@@ controlled study about 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were dis@@ continued despite three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced itself to 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued only insulin ; a reduction in insulin @-@ based group was observed in the group of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ onal compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small and 18 @-@ week study of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics .
&quot; in most clinical trials were observed in comparison to placebo a reduction of the total plasma fun@@ nel and the free fatty acids , and a rise in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as low , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in comparison to placebo &apos;s met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ ca@@ em@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ ols .
compared to placebo was not statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels observed while met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values have been observed .
&quot; in a study on 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has not only reduced the fun@@ nel tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the Tri@@ gl@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ it@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular output , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is rapidly resor@@ bed , whereby the top con@@ centric Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV reflects the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies could be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ mon@@ y ( Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) and lo@@ wers the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ active distinctive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the mark@@ er was found mainly in the shelves ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the Har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination time of un@@ changing Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is for man 5 @-@ 6 hours and that of the entire active Met@@ abol@@ ites is at 16 - 23 hours .
the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its Met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy pros but the prim@@ ates of the oral clearing of the native material but resem@@ ble .
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , according to repeti@@ tive administration @-@ volume plasma @-@ magnific@@ ation with hoo@@ ks , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible cardi@@ op@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , dimin@@ ished in the link@@ age of hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the feder@@ ate growth . &quot;
in long term studies ( up to 2 years ) have been induc@@ ed in the rat of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male cr@@ ates ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous Poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons led to an increased frequency of colon@@ ists .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the markings &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; the cran@@ ial incidence amoun@@ ted to 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years with the women of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated women and 1,@@ 1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a compar@@ ision . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision drug . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical studies over 1 year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ onal compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study on 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is not only a so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study l@@ acked the goal of its primary end@@ point , which represents a combination of the overall survival , non @-@ deadly cor@@ yo@@ car@@ dium , stroke and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , coron@@ ary ar@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , cor@@ onal re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries that are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no cardiovascular risk . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and carry on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the ins@@ cription &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events regarding bone brood from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials were treated with more than 8,@@ 100 patients with more than 8,@@ 100 patients who received with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and increased from over 7,@@ 400 patients to compar@@ atively increased incidence of bone brood in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study about 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with a compar@@ ision drug . &quot;
&quot; in a study on 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the fun@@ nel tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this is both a effect on the tri@@ gl@@ it@@ eri@@ de absorption and hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ it@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was tested in a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as does not produce insulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin in effectively . &quot;
&quot; after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied ha@@ em@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a decrease of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c sp@@ eg@@ els , which pointed out that the blood sugar level is similar to it with a different human@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an should not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ly ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the complete list is the Pack@@ ages ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) achieved the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ans ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks of diabetes in relation to the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission shared the Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the release of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already had signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pains and inflammation in joints ) or pl@@ itu@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; ) , that can lead to artic@@ ulated and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ure@@ tic level depends on two to four weeks more and more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , even tox@@ ins can occur ; for this reason , patients may take at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for preventing gyp@@ sies . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ@@ transplan@@ tation because it has not been studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , participating in the 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( spotlight ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ tic leu@@ ka@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied to a dose of 300 mg once daily ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary bars have been under 6 mg / d@@ l in the blood of the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) had received 80 mg once every day , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once had a daily 120 mg , with the last three measurements of a ure@@ tic level in the blood of less than 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , it was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adenauer ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , skin rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with heart problems , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects which affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary tract in blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
&quot; treatment of chronic Hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to pri@@ at@@ abl@@ ings ( including one of the medical history known or currently present toxicity and / or an toxicity ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ cker &apos;s bar after 2 @-@ 4 weeks is still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , a dosage increased to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with severe kidney function , the effectiveness and safety has not been completely investigated so far ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ tra Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people have no experience in children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; organ@@ transplan@@ ts received no experience at Organ@@ ic tat@@ too , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In case of patients with isch@@ a@@ oh@@ coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or de@@ compensated cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency is not recommended to treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ ant medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to a acute tox@@ ics , because by reducing the Ser@@ um har@@ n@@ so@@ ur@@ pi@@ eg@@ els initially to be mobil@@ ised in tissue . &quot;

liver disease during the clinical studies of Phase 3 were observed light abnorm@@ alities of liver function with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate patients to be observed ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended , before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s , and in the further course depending on the clinical trial for a liver study ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was were not done in@@ effective studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ shirt can lead to an increase in the The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhibit@@ ation of the met@@ alli@@ zation of The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) . &quot;

pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not include side effects from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate to pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; zo@@ experimental studies do not allow directly or indirect effects on pregnancy , embryonic development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , serve of machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities , until they can be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC is not detrimental to their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the test @-@ colored events was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies found significant differences to F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ nit@@ rate or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .

the prescribed studies reported during long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in the studies of phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .
the following treatment related events have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups in total more than once and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ( up to 4 years with an assessment time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patients ) .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) which were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out study .
the primary efficacy point was in each study the share of patients with which the last three month of certain ser@@ um har@@ n@@ so@@ ar bar &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were included .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a service incre@@ mentally at the beginning of a study of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study demonstrated in terms of reducing the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ so@@ ar level below 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority both of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated in terms of lasting reduction in the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els among 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction in the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ sä@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) has been observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and permanently maintain over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with Ser@@ um@@ an@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ ase &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function . the AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness in 40 patients with kidney function ( d. h ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point was made at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x per day ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there was no clinical significant differences in the process of ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ac@@ acid concentrations in proportions , regardless of their renal function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disorder ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ centr@@ ations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a ser@@ um res@@ in con@@ centr@@ ation of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years of the open extension study during phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction in the incidence of gyp@@ sy@@ ism was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 required no treatment against a g@@ love g@@ love ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the g@@ gling size , which with 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ cht@@ ing no@@ des until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 8 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
for healthy pros the maximum Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate after administration is easier and multi @-@ cou@@ pler from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than the dos@@ o dis@@ proportionate increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking a simple or multi @-@ pler doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , there was no clinical significant change in percentage decline in ser@@ um @-@ acid inhibit@@ ation , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady @-@ state distribution volume ( v@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma allo@@ y of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is achieved over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( an illness , in which the bones are used in women after men@@ opause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking advantage of other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamin in@@ supple@@ mentary ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient should not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines which are approved in the European Union and put the company data from earlier studies and the published literature .
the company also carried out a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to detect the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D sp@@ eg@@ els .

&quot; the company also laid out data that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose is exactly the dose which is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headaches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( muscles , bones , or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , beverage or intru@@ sion of medicines ( including ant@@ acid , calcium and vitamins ) for the day . &quot;
following notes are precisely to be followed to reduce the risk of ös@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE shall be swal@@ lowed up after the day of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is composed , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is supposed to leave , as a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a is supposed to take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tics , are given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms which are advised to indicate possible irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when dro@@ pping or retro@@ viral pain or new or become lim@@ mer@@ ing so@@ ckets burn the medicine and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
3 The risk of severe ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who are not correctly taking the medicine correctly and / or after the appearance of symptoms that indicate a mal@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important to be given to the patient transfers to the patients and understood by patients ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at no increased risk was determined , rare ( after market launch ) stomach and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the inser@@ ting of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who require a j@@ aw surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the j@@ aw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the doctor &apos;s treated doctor is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be reli@@ ant that they should take the tablet in the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their om@@ issions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally scheduled for the week@@ day . &quot;
other disorders that affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated before the beginning of the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ ir@@ ron@@ at foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplement , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ ignation of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait for at least 30 minutes after taking al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies have not been performed , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without being clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore must not apply during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no indication of direct harmful effects with regard to pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vaginal is administered for adult patients , which was a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ ul@@ ting of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft have already been used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously performed studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vaginal raf has been compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , in which transp@@ l@@ ant has been st@@ acked after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , as often a renewed organ@@ transplan@@ tation or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies have been conducted in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and studied how Ad@@ vaginal raf in comparison with Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with a hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components Ad@@ vaginal should not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) drugs should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vaginal medication since the Ad@@ vaginal dose or the dose of the currently used medication should be adjusted accordingly .

&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should be able to classi@@ fy this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to the clinical @-@ relevant differences of systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ plan@@ ation or an increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ isation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical practitioner ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vaginal should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual case and on blood levels ( see below , &quot;
&quot; after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us body levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a talent level , with both formulations of both in kidney and le@@ aking transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after a transp@@ l@@ ant under Ad@@ vaginal to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ no@@ ons of time .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vaginal Dos@@ is@@ chem@@ e can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the state of the patient allowed no oral intake of drugs in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment is intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application of the application of the transplan@@ tation , the immune system must be maintained ; consequently , the immune system can not be specified and consequently a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
tin recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ fer@@ rous Therap@@ y The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further tin adap@@ tations may be possible later because the Phar@@ mac@@ o@@ ine@@ tics can change from Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us during the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
tin recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of Tran@@ splan@@ tat@@ ted The or@@ ale Ad@@ vaginal therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , must be converted to a transp@@ l@@ tat@@ too of twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vaginal capsules , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants on Ad@@ vaginal once daily needs to start treatment with each in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation recommended or@@ al@@ d@@ osis for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transp@@ l@@ ant on adult patients , which are placed on Ad@@ vaginal , is an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transp@@ l@@ ors , although there is no clinical experience with Ad@@ te@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pan@@ demic use and col@@ li@@ zed patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function to maintain blood @-@ mirror in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver disorder a reduction of the dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Da kidney function does not influence the pharmaceutical function of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the Ser@@ um@@ an@@ at@@ in@@ ) is recommended , a calculation of the creation and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
conversion from Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Ad@@ vaginal With the conversion from a cy@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations on the valley levels in full bloody , The dose should be primarily based on clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in the individual case under attack by full blu@@ t @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ mirror checks . &quot;
it is recommended to carry out frequent checks in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us talent levels during the first two weeks after a transp@@ l@@ ant followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy .
&quot; blood @-@ talent of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vaginal , dosage adjustment , modifications of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous application of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full blood circulation ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal is a drug with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State occurred . &quot;
data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the mirror levels in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml does not exceed .
in clinical practice the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in full swing in the first time of liver transplan@@ ts usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with ant@@ ages - and sav@@ ory patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent exploration of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts , blood con@@ centr@@ ations were usually used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious unwanted events , including transplan@@ ts or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a consequence of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transp@@ l@@ ant medical practitioner ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment adult patients with transplan@@ tive tat@@ ters that proved to be in@@ consistent with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vaginal . &quot;
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ actic Fast@@ eners at adult heart transplan@@ tation and transp@@ l@@ ors in the kin@@ des@@ age are not yet clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation Ad@@ vaginal .
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction in the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal medicines ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) contain , or other plant healing during a treatment with Ad@@ vaginal Dis@@ ability ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood are offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels under such circumstances be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under pro@@ gra@@ f , was considered to be seen as a cardi@@ ac disease or Sept@@ hu@@ al hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also be found under Ad@@ vag@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver disorder , infection , liquid pollution and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of mal@@ ignant skin lesi@@ ons by suitable clothing or use of a solar protection using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients assume the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for pris@@ ings like head@@ ache , changed state of consciousness , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vaginal carbide rings , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose contain , is available in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose intolerance , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose tin@@ act@@ ose Mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies , which are known as inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended that can change the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the simultaneous gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
a strongly distinctive interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ yc@@ otic drugs such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ id@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol and the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV @-@ Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies studies , that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the inhibit@@ ory of the g@@ astro@@ intestinal duct . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ do@@ si@@ zed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used for acute abor@@ tion , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or reduce the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood . &quot;
effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicinal drugs may be metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism means .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us desc@@ ends the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus can increase hormonal exposure , is especially careful when making decisions more receptive . &quot;
the results of animal attempts have shown that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can extend their half @-@ time .
the results of a small number of investigations on transp@@ l@@ ant patients give no indication that among Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in comparison to other immune sup@@ press@@ ants is an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o Ex@@ pos@@ ure , a monitoring of the new@@ bor@@ ns for possible effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;

cases of B@@ K @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated multi @-@ virus leu@@ co@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vis@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; it has been reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign , including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high loyalty of Er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma is assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ able . &quot;
&quot; active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects on molecular level should be conve@@ yed to the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its loyalty to a cy@@ tos@@ o@@ ic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent chem@@ ist of signal @-@ reduction due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the trans@@ cription of a certain number of ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ kin genes .

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate blood pressure disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application depends on whether Adv@@ ent is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
&quot; it is produced by a cell that was introduced into one gene ( DNA ) , which it is committed to the formation of the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is approved by another in the European Union named Re@@ y@@ ate , similarly , however , is made differently so that the medicine contains no proteins human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was investigated using bleeding and surgical intervention . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was evaluated in the prevention of blood vessels in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or with &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate may not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or Ham@@ dying protein or one of the other components . &quot;
March 2004 the European Commission signed the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for the recovery of Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy according to the severity of the factor VIII , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
&quot; at the following here@@ ha@@ in events , the factor VIII @-@ activity in the corresponding period is not intended to sink under the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in that time / d@@ l ) . &quot;
inj@@ ecting every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated . &quot;
inj@@ ecting every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during treatment course , it is used to control the dose and frequency of injections , an appropriate provision of factor VIII @-@ plasma bars . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times . &quot;
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis z@@ ur @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses of 20 to 40 by factor VIII per kilo@@ gram body weight by 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plastic activities are not achieved , or if the blood flow is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to prove to be a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic interventions must be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the rate @-@ speed should be directed after the patient &apos;s procedure , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators activity by factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma per ml plasma .
&quot; the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positioning days is the greatest and dependent on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; for pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 signs and am@@ nesty , known inhibit@@ or development was observed , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII @-@ product to another , the recur@@ rence of inhibit@@ ors ) In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare rise of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , women lie on the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients who have previously untreated patients who have a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 up to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is very rare ( incidence based on the available data not neg@@ li@@ gible ) . &quot;

the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in plasma as well as the clearing rate showed sufficient values on 15 post@@ operative day .
&quot; in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnostic hard to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inflation ( 2.4 B.@@ E. with the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;
in addition to none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed in severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) an F@@ VIII inhibit@@ or .
&quot; in previous patients , not treated patients of a current clinical trial , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of the patients on traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed through the investigation of the anti@@ body ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters , and measured side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward vision as well as an ongoing peak of the anti@@ body level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise however , did not appear any signs or symptoms that raised to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , united on the appearance of Ur@@ tik@@ aria , Pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and elevated number e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es reported on several repeated product positions in the context of the study . &quot;

December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited with the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) officially agreed that the company returns its application for approval for the in@@ transport of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the meadow ( tissue , the other structures in the body connects , surrounds and leans ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically modified , that there can be one gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has changed so that there are no copies of itself and thus no infections can trigger people . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in could be inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , and thus enable the tum@@ our cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein which is derived from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body is usually formed to recover DNA , and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene def@@ ective is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer in the field of the sub @-@ building , entered the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company on the questions posed , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of initial documents , the CH@@ MP is issued on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore has advantages for the patient . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug through the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not know the CH@@ MP , whether the withdrawal of consequences for patients is currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; &quot; Com@@ ment @-@ Use &quot; &quot; programs with an E@@ ex@@ in . &quot;
&quot; modified active ingredient &quot; means that the tablets are so mer@@ ging that one of the effective components can be released immediately , and the other is slowly released over a few hours . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len produced inflammation of the nose @-@ loop ) in patients with nose @-@ loop ( co@@ oper@@ able nose ) . &quot;
for adults and juven@@ iles at the age of 12 the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily to be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ loop ( hidden nose ) , are deduc@@ ted . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be detrimental to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main more effective interventions were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ y fever , which were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard sc@@ ure , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all hay@@ fever , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , compared with a decrease of symptoms by 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ loop has been considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a link between symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26,@@ 7 % in patients who took dis@@ lor@@ ry in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , oral di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ otrop@@ hic hyper@@ activity ( eg@@ l@@ act@@ lessness ) , ti@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ enz ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ness ) , sleeping disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients suffering from a bot@@ angle glau@@ coma ( hypertension ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ tis ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) or have already had a risk for a mur@@ der@@ ha@@ in stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission , the European Commission , SP Europe distributed the approval of the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however it can be swal@@ low in the whole ( d. h. without it to cr@@ ush or di@@ gest ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after lowering the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days , as for long @-@ term survival , the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time . &quot;
&quot; after the decline of the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ass in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after completion of such a therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ in@@ amine , vap@@ ori@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ in , eph@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ in , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ ol@@ olin , Nap@@ ol@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the security and effectiveness of this combination therapy has not been verified for this patient collective , and the data are not enough to send corresponding recommendations to the dosage . &quot;
safety and the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data are not enough to send corresponding recommendations to the dosage .
&quot; patients must be notified that treatment in the occurrence of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , or other neurological disorders , sickness or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of headaches ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; in treating the following patient groups , care is recommended : • patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with cardi@@ ac disease in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological testing since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce in their extent .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ ries in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol have additionally been administered , however , there were no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or testing , no significant differences could be found between the patients with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether dis@@ infection was taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the metabol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ th@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes was not yet identified , so that interactions with other drugs cannot be ruled out completely . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
the in@@ conceivable use of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured to experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancy outcomes however no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ k@@ tor@@ ical properties of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied to aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however understand that it may occur in very rare cases to a ben@@ evol@@ ence , which can lead to impairment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , Ap@@ no@@ e , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular h@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ ways , con@@ vul@@ sion ) with possible let@@ tu@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , ag@@ grav@@ ure , muscle weakness and increased muscle tone , euph@@ oric , arousal , vom@@ iting , sickness , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , ten@@ sing , ten@@ sing , ten@@ sing , ten@@ sing , ten@@ sing and hyp@@ ot@@ ony or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely to children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mou@@ th@@ iness , pu@@ up@@ ill@@ ary and g@@ ossi@@ ation , bon@@ ding , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ found@@ ational cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells and c@@ ophil@@ es on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dose of adult with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes of flight performance , including the strengthening of subjective bats or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were detected at the recommended Dos@@ age of 5 mg daily with no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to placebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ or manifest@@ os of a Z@@ N arousal . &quot;
&quot; it took 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficiency of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nas@@ al @-@ loop @-@ swelling ) , significantly higher than below a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the slo@@ ping effect , determined by the nose @-@ loop , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ ries in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed with regard to gender , age or ethnic @-@ defined patients no significant differences . &quot;
as part of a single dose study to the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze it is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
according to the per@@ or@@ al application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy pro@@ ban@@ den over 14 days the flow @-@ weight of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in day 10 reaches . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was performed with the formulation as a tablet at healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ den , it was found that four pro@@ ban@@ ces of dis@@ lor@@ ry was very rare . &quot;
an components Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ Study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equi@@ valence was to exposure to the administration of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on security strategies , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity , pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with dis@@ lor@@ ence and no special dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; the combination possessed no greater toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ production studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ in at the or@@ al gift of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day is not ter@@ ato@@ genic . &quot;
March 2007 and Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application of application of pharmaceuticals are established and works before and while the product is on the market .
&quot; hist@@ amine wear to allevi@@ ate the allergic symptoms , by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect can unfold . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms which occur in connection with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) such as kidney , current or ju@@ ck@@ ling nose and tri@@ ck@@ ling eyes with simultaneous con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; it is available as 5 mg @-@ tablet , 5 m@@ g@@ - Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at to capture ( sol@@ uble tablet ) , 2.5 m@@ g@@ - and 5 mg @-@ melting pills ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml @-@ sy@@ rup and as 0,5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies at seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( itch , number and size of the qu@@ add@@ ling , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weekly treatment . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies submitted to detect that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to capture and melting pot in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us has been taken by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom amoun@@ ted to six weekly treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission signed the Commission SP Europe for approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to reli@@ eving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy in application of dis@@ lor@@ ries in youth from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter @-@ allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be completed according to the previous disease process and can be completed after the end of the symptoms and when re @-@ occurred again .
the pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients throughout the allergy time a continuous treatment .
clinical relevant interactions were not found in the context of clinical studies with dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ in tablets where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the in@@ age of A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases it may come to ben@@ ding , which can lead to impairment of traffic , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently posed side effects which was reported more frequently than in placebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mou@@ th@@ less dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years was the com@@ mon@@ est side effect of the patients who were treated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with dis @-@ lor@@ ry and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo .
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , at which up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ found@@ ational cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells and c@@ ophil@@ es on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ fac@@ tions , in the dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily was administered every day by 14 days , no statistical or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in the dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of the clinical dose ) was administered for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dose @-@ study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ad@@ in 5 mg has no influence on standard measurement sizes of flight performance including the strengthening subjective hassle or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and itch of nose , j@@ erk@@ iness , tr@@ ams and redness of the eyes as well as j@@ erk@@ rei@@ z on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified according to the duration of symptoms and also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as a occurrence of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the total of the questionn@@ aires for the quality of life with Rhino economic ti@@ vi@@ tis , reduces A@@ eri@@ us effectively which is characterized by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was investig@@ ating further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ology of the eth@@ ic in different forms is similar and chron@@ ically patients can be re@@ pro@@ secuted .
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is an caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ulous diseases , it is expected that Des@@ tru@@ th@@ ad@@ in apart from other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria is also leading to improving symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was as@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of p@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin intervals .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients with dis@@ lor@@ ries in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of sleep and wak@@ ening is significant as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients with the general seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s would be comparable with 4 % of patients increased a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ ries . &quot;
there are no clue to a clin@@ ically relevant p@@ ulation for a clinical use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ tru@@ th@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes , however , has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs are not completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ in inhi@@ bited in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ Gly@@ co@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
in a single dose study with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 7.5 mg real meals ( fatty acid breakfast ) do not affect the availability of dis@@ lor@@ ries .
&quot; the clinical trials conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in conducted in pre@@ clinical studies , in a comparable degree of exposure from dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the toxicity of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and from Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on security strategies , toxicity in repeti@@ tive gift , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity can recognize the pre@@ clinical data with dis@@ lor@@ ry in no particular danger to man . &quot;
&quot; coloured movie ( contains l@@ act@@ ose @-@ mon@@ Gen@@ ic , hy@@ on@@ less , titan@@ ium dioxide , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go@@ car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , color@@ less film ( contains hy@@ s@@ less , Macro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , Car@@ nau@@ ba@@ c , a light wax . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years ( see below section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available to support a inf@@ ective rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ alies should play a role in diagnos@@ ing the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratory studies . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of metabolic dis@@ lor@@ ries in limited and learn a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ure ( see below section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up for children between 2 and 11 years old , which is restricted to metabolic , is identical to the children who are normally metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients should not take with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose absorption or a Sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ - in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine . &quot;
clinical relevant interactions were not determined in the context of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets which were additionally administered in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol were additionally administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the in@@ age of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol was not ampli@@ fied by alcohol ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up group similar to the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported in the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study on adults and juven@@ iles , at which up to 45 mg of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( ninete@@ en clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;

&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in in adults can be extr@@ ap@@ ed in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a clinical study with multiple adults and juven@@ iles , in the dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in the dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ ad@@ in in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) has been applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls showed itself . &quot;

&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ form of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are restricted to metabolic rate .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was about 3 to 6 hours higher and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a termin@@ al half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no clue to a clinical use of dis@@ infection after a daily use of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .

there are limited experience from clinical studies on the efficacy in application of dis@@ lor@@ ries in youth from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately prior to the application , the bl@@ ister needs to be carefully opened and the dose of melting tablet is taken , without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and in@@ consistency of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall prevalence of side effects between the dis@@ lor@@ ence between the dis@@ lor@@ y@@ ad@@ ins Sir@@ up@@ - and the placebo group was identical and turned not significantly from the safety profile used in adult patients .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. is officially agreed that the company has reg@@ ained its application for approval for the failure of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied by adults and elderly people for the protection against flu which is caused by the trunk ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a trunk of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; Gri@@ pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of flu virus is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man , because the people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; according to administration of the vaccine , the immune system ackno@@ wle@@ dges the parts of the flu virus as &quot; body @-@ alien &quot; and constitutes antibodies against it . &quot;
the immune system is later able to make contact with an influenza virus this pedi@@ ms faster antibodies .
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body foreign ) , re@@ united and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; inspection of some of the study centers showed that the study was not performed according to &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the scope of the clinical data base for assessing the security of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for preventive vaccines . &quot;
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years which are infected with human immun@@ ode@@ che@@ virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which are infected with the acquired immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase stands as a solution to capture , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has examined , which anti@@ viral medicines have previously taken , and the likelihood has judged the virus to address the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; for children between the ages of four and twelve , and with patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of aging is based on body weight . &quot;
axi@@ as is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at low levels .
&quot; AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and thereby delay the development of AIDS related infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously had not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this with low do@@ si@@ fied gem@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously been prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other prot@@ eas@@ antry are compared . &quot;
main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ants , even after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than among placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , only very few to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , which were treated as effective with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ weekly treatment as well as other prot@@ eas@@ ations : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , that was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase to a stronger waste of the virus last for four weeks as with the patients who continue their previous prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headaches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fatima gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase must also not be used in patients , cur@@ ses ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are just as normal as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other drugs against HIV there is patients suffering , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ee@@ pers ( symptoms of an infection , caused by the immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) achieved the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ war@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared with the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee noted that the use of A@@ war@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously been no prot@@ eas@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; a@@ gener@@ ase was originally allowed under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information was presented . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group limited approval for approval of A@@ war@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , pro@@ sthe@@ tic ( PI ) , and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r along with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r should take place considering the individual viral agent and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generative capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg Am@@ mm@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants have not been studied in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the lack of data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ generative caps in adult patients with moderate liver disorder on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver disorder on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations which contain Johann@@ is@@ k@@ ine ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ mm@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that ag@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination . &quot;
for usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have an increased risk for heavy liver impacts with potentially deadly disease . &quot;
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please refer to the technical information of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with existing reduced liver function , including chron@@ ically @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under a anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ generative and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ cular or other glu@@ k@@ ok@@ o@@ ids , which is not recommended above C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment is the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and Sup@@ pression of the renal glands ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ap@@ ex with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( among the monitoring of the International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma bars in Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ blown avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ onic symptoms , especially if there are also low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of toxicity because of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ generative solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in length 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ dd@@ skins are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ers , was reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ az@@ er@@ cion of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to be associated with therapy drugs which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug dependent factors , like a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ ka@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous and hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy with severe immun@@ isation therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to serious clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune system , higher body size index ) , cases were reported by oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase should not simultaneously have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ war@@ ase is not allowed to be combined with pharmaceuticals whose active substances are primarily associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plas@@ modi@@ ties with he@@ avi@@ est and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; at the attempt to detect the degra@@ ding plastic bars by a dose of other protein inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver observed . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ k@@ herb ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r can be brought low by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient is already fed by Johann@@ is@@ k@@ herb , the amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r@@ ine mirror , and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and cut the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which is the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ kable of this treatment site . &quot;
52 % humili@@ ates if Am@@ pri@@ est@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ viol@@ r + 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered .
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma was achieved in the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended to a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there has been no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with di@@ dan@@ o in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ as , however , due to the phantas@@ tic component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , it is recommended that the income of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da down ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) does not require dosage adjustment . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
the effect of ne@@ viral to other prot@@ eas@@ antry and available limited data suggest that Ne@@ viral into the Ser@@ um@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation may lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din should be less effective because of the decreased or perhaps sub@@ therapeutic plastic bars could be less effective . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus an increase in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin levels .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered along with A@@ generative , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; Phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted , however the Plasma level of both medicine could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ mm@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma at 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 replies ) to the 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ m compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once a day without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ az@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly lead to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be applied to toxic reactions associated with these medicines , when they are used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ antry , it is advisable that ant@@ acid cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to res@@ entment disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as an enzyme all@@ ine ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with Am@@ blown avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of plasma bars of Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium carbonate like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Rocky di@@ pin , ni@@ p pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ ckel pin pin , cervi@@ cal pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased 10 through Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r , thereby causing the activity and toxicity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ war@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations , and ampli@@ fy with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , ten@@ acity and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den were increased the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ ate ( 90 % per day ) while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous gift of A@@ war@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these Glu@@ c@@ ok@@ o@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment weigh the risk of systemic si@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , the frac@@ tures of plasma bars are expected at the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since Plas@@ mas@@ hed increases of these H@@ M@@ G @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors may lead to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeu@@ tical concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror as the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased from am@@ ino@@ cul@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be applied together with edi@@ fic@@ tional mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is offered with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants indicates a possible increase in the plasma level of mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ onic symptoms , especially if there are also low doses from Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of compar@@ ability of historical comparisons , there is currently no recommendation given to adjust how the Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is to be adjusted at the same time when Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not pre@@ dict , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption methods are recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended by A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine must be applied only after careful dismantling of potential commercial use for the mother in comparison with the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk check @-@ box rats were detected Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , it is not known if Am@@ pri@@ cl@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a re@@ production study of the r@@ ams which was given by the n@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ klu@@ ft pregnancy . during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase of the 12 body weight is given at the offspring .
the further development of im@@ mortality including fer@@ til@@ isation and reproductive capacity was not com@@ promised by the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most associated with the a@@ gener@@ ase treatment connected side effects were slightly to moderate , occurred early and rarely resulted in the treatment of treatment . &quot;
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of axi@@ ase or another at the same time applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side @-@ mentioned side effects are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which prot@@ eas@@ ants do not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , used by the investig@@ ator than in connection with the study media , and recorded at over 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of subject laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of periph@@ eral and resili@@ ent fatty tissue , multip@@ ell@@ ular and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection ( stit@@ ches ) . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ fit , not pre @-@ treated people who were treated with Am@@ ast@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine , over a medium term of 36 weeks , was only observed ( stit@@ ches ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - prescribed patients under Am@@ blown avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) with 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a middle duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin attacks were usually easy to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ id@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without j@@ erk@@ iness and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks , without the treatment with Am@@ ino@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with generally known risk factors of advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune def@@ ective can develop an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .

&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ ni@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines the resistance as the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V / C / T / V , I@@ 84@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M , as well as a dimin@@ ished probability of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up current interpre@@ tations systems to analyse the results of resili@@ ence . &quot;
on phenomenon @-@ based analyses of Klin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otype @-@ interpre@@ tations systems can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for the assessment of the activity of Am@@ pri@@ mor@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ on @-@ resistant insul@@ ates .
&quot; companies who sell diagnostic tests , have clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otype cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ders ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to interpre@@ ting results of a resource testing . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ated genetic patterns generated a certain crus@@ hing resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ nete rests , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients with which a Fos@@ ag@@ grav@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ viol@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , In@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 Isol@@ ate ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ations @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early interruption of a se@@ perate therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a multitude of mut@@ ations in limits that may affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of axi@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open trial ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ C ) with an PI , predominantly with lowest k@@ do@@ si@@ da@@ r &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert , &quot; received . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty patients ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ under@@ superiority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI Group in terms of time @-@ ad@@ ated average ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the virus after 16 weeks ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the non @-@ under@@ weight wave of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ approved A@@ war@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children between the ages of 2 and 18 .
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generative solution was approved for inser@@ ting and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low do@@ si@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients received a plasma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration of 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ ated increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value . &quot;
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cally on this data should be considered with the treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children , to the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ approved &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
after oral administration the average duration ( maximum ) up to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max currently reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with Am@@ blown avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the intake , although the simultaneous food intake influence the scale and rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent position volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of Am@@ pri@@ zed from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease of the overall concentration of the substance in plasma , with the quantity of un@@ bund@@ led Am@@ pri@@ zed , which will probably remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r remains consistent , the percentage of the free active component in dependence on the total medical level in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss &quot;
therefore medicine must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ or or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are given to be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generative capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily v@@ itali@@ an exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r is due to the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ are@@ foot@@ er than from the capsules , therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and ap@@ e@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram . &quot;
also the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney disorder is likely to be low on the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these therapies schem@@ ata lead to Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r @-@ plasma comparable to those that are achieved at healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ cr@@ ity with Am@@ blown avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at dos@@ ages , which spoke to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present expos@@ ures to people , both clinical studies as well as for therapeu@@ tical application , however , there are little evidence of adopting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial Re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes in human periph@@ eral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver toxicity can be detected in clinical daily life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; previously , clinical trials has not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies for toxicity in young animals that were treated from an age of 4 days were treated both in control and with Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r animals that were high mortality .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposure which was significant among ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the anticipated exposure to therapeutic dosage , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes that point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generative capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sted ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generative capsules is 20 mg Am@@ mm@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application is to be done with caution in patients with qu@@ aint or lighter liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( among the monitoring of the International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in length 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ dd@@ skins are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
the C@@ min values of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in plasma was achieved in the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg / k@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended to a close monitoring , as the effectiveness and in@@ conceivable of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ers would be low .
&quot; if these drugs are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be made , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin can be administered along with A@@ generative , becomes a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentrations of calcium carbonate like Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Rocky di@@ pin , ni@@ p pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ di@@ pin , cervi@@ cal pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r , thereby causing the activity and toxicity of this medicine . &quot;
in a clinical study conducted in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ den were increased the Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate Plas@@ tic@@ ate ( 90 % per day ) while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol ( 90 % -@@ Con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ intervals 82 to 89 % ) .
&quot; at the simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) is recommended for the possibility of de@@ preci@@ ation or rein@@ forcement of anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ blown avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine must be applied only after careful dismantling of potential commercial use for the mother in comparison with the possible risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
a re@@ production study of special r@@ ams which was given by the n@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ klu@@ ft pregnancy . during the lac@@ tation was a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight when descendants .
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of exagger@@ ation , the patient is at signs of in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) to observe if necessary , are necessary supportive policies . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in ak@@ ut and chron@@ ically infected with ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % inhi@@ bit inhibit@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ pri@@ mor@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and is 0.@@ 41 µm in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µm = 0,@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ations @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , it should be considered in treatment optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children of the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ approved &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r remains consistent , the percentage of the free active component in dependence on the total medical level in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the area of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
therefore medicine must indu@@ ce the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhibit@@ or or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 if they are given to be given at the same time ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
also the renal clearing of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of kidney disorder is likely to be low on the Eli@@ min@@ ation of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies for can@@ o@@ cr@@ ity with Am@@ blown avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ ome at doses of 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - times of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular Aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet un@@ solved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present expos@@ ures to people , both of clinical studies as well as for therapeu@@ tical application , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

studies for toxicity in young animals that were treated from an age of 4 days were treated both in control and with Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r animals that were high mortality .
&quot; these results make it clear that juven@@ iles are still not fully mature , so Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ scal@@ ase solution to capture is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ antry ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ generative solution for inser@@ tion was not proven neither with PI @-@ treated patients with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a solution to capture is 14 % lower than from Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , a@@ ase capsules and solution for inser@@ tion on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to capture ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ generative solution is 17 mg ( 1,@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ ins@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , since no tin @-@ recommendations can be given for the simultaneous application of A@@ war@@ ase solution for taking and low do@@ si@@ fied gem@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided in this combination with this patient &apos;s arms . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for Am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r is not necessary for necessary , is an application of A@@ generative solution for taking in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col is A@@ generative solution for those in infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure , and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration may lead to a Com@@ peti@@ tive inhibit@@ ation of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be noted that ag@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 in transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( among the monitoring of the International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) , are methods of determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be removed in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ dd@@ skins are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk for a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ ka@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous and hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and to a resource development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increases , for C@@ max is reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ war@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations , and can increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , ten@@ acity and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to be used by Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

&quot; in the milk check @-@ box rats were detected Am@@ pri@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances , it is not known if Am@@ pri@@ cl@@ avi@@ r is transferred to people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a re@@ production study of such disorders which was administered from Ein@@ n@@ ist@@ ung in the uter@@ us up to the end of lac@@ klu@@ ft period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during lac@@ tation . &quot;
the in@@ consistency of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; with many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of axi@@ ase or another at the same time applied to HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease . &quot;
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ not pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ ino@@ vi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - the described mut@@ ations are rarely observed .

&quot; the application rigi@@ dity and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treating condition in the genital area , Al@@ dara is up to a maximum of 16 weeks a week , • In case of two four @-@ weekly treatment cycles , each week with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; cream is inf@@ used in front of the bed@@ time frame , so that it remains sufficient for long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each 16 weeks . &quot;
main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete cooling of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell disease in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or placebo every day or five weekly .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete cooling of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies at a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acoustic ker@@ at@@ os .
&quot; in all studies Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • When the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was treated 15 % to 52 % in patients with Al@@ dara patients , but only 3 % to 18 % in patients with Al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or itch ) .
&quot; sound@@ ing typical , not hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ chy , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants ( AK@@ s ) on the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ cular adults , if the size or the number of lesi@@ ons are limiting the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;

&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all visible f@@ eig@@ ners have disappeared in the genital or period range , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an interruption in the above @-@ described treatment plan should occur when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) or if in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; if at follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second line treatment the lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was abandoned , the patient had put the cream when he / she noticed this and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is absorbed in a thin layer , and to cast into the framed , using f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin , until the cream has been completely drawn . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take an acceptance between the benefit of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a potential worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
&quot; the risk associated with this patient should take place between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , and the risk associated with possible organ@@ ab@@ dic@@ ation or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one for circumc@@ ision le@@ aks observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk for heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , even among proper application heavy local skin irritation were observed , which made a treatment required and / or to have temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine that needed an emergency ca@@ the@@ ori@@ zation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous funds for the treatment of extreme f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and period range there are no clinical experiences so far . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of funds reduction in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser efficacy in this patient group regarding the removal of the f@@ eig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm to the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin actions are common but the intensity of this reaction takes place in general during therapy or the reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary because of the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local skin actions , a treatment break can be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be judged after the re@@ plen@@ ishment of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the treatment of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , super@@ fici@@ ally bases should consider other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , there are no clinical experiences before , therefore the application of previously prescribed tum@@ ors is not recommended . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lesser probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy consists .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of acoustic ker@@ at@@ oses , inside the nose , or the ears or on the lips within the lips . &quot;
&quot; there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , for the treatment of acoustic ker@@ at@@ oses of anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the available data on the actic ker@@ at@@ ose on the sub@@ poor and hands support the effectiveness in this application &apos;s purpose , so it is not recommended such an application . &quot;
local skin actions often occur but these reactions usually take effect in the course of therapy or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin @-@ actions are great un@@ eas@@ iness , or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ ER lesi@@ ons show less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies , no direct or indirect effect on pregnancy , the embryonic / federal development , the dis@@ connection or post@@ nat@@ al development process ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ recurring application , quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) has been reached , no recommendation can be given to the application during down@@ time . &quot;
the most frequently shared and as likely or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation related side effects in the studies with three weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
&quot; among the most frequently reported and probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the applic@@ ations@@ ort with an incidence of 2@@ 8,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the study of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of phase III reported side effects are shown below .
the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effect , in these studies were a reaction at the application location ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
side effects that were mentioned from 25@@ 2 in plac@@ e@@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ational ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; this according to study schedule , evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently came to local skin actions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion or he@@ els ( 14 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the evaluation of the clinical signs , the evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five @-@ time treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream very often leads to severe cold subjects ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and too severe pi@@ or@@ f@@ ation and c@@ rests ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for the investigation of the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acoustic ker@@ at@@ osis , al@@ op@@ zie was established with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the apparent unique recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , mysti@@ cism and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred according to several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;

in 3 per@@ missions relevant phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in regard to a complete healing of the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior to a placebo treatment .
&quot; at 60 % of the total of 119 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients treated the F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely ; this was 20 % of the patients with placebo @-@ treated patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;

the calculated apparent half @-@ value lay approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged Ret@@ en@@ tion of the drug through the skin .
&quot; the data for systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , according to topical skin of patients aged 6 to 12 years was low and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ mos@@ or super@@ car@@ cin@@ oma . &quot;

&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to form almost all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the treatment of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged interruption , must be taken carefully due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ lock ) to deal with the potential occurrence associated reactions .
&quot; in case of an easy or moderate @-@ wide in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be vo@@ iced and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to half the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is required . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( Anti @-@ hist@@ amine and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of in@@ fusion rate occurred in which the preceding reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
&quot; veterinary studies do not leave directly or indirect effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; no data for new@@ bor@@ ns that were expon@@ entially po@@ unded over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended while the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not too breastfeeding . &quot;
&quot; side effects in clinical trials have been prescribed mainly as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which at 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients were observed in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) . &quot;
unwanted drug actions associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a total treatment duration of up to 4 years ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , heavy reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial wrinkles ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desired drug impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ e- 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe decay and treatment duration of up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , it was reported in 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version , whereby it came to a Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version in the age of 5 years ( average after 26 days over 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients no longer det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ting researchers ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies before including 3 patients , in which there was never too ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of lower body rejuven@@ ates for a ru@@ gged reduction in the gel mirror in the Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies to determine a variable reduction of g@@ ag in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in the Phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally until low neutral inhibit@@ ory effects on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to interfere with clinical effectiveness and / or reducing gin in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug actions although the appearance of unwanted drug interactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale of the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulation of accumulation and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ates recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ e@@ controlled phase @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged between 6 and 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were dis@@ continued by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients have been recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute secret distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients against the placebo group , an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and o@@ in@@ ability which is shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , improvement and / or maintenance of these effects showed up to 20@@ 8 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as goes out of the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically and the absolute lung @-@ volume increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) until the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant decrease in the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the end of the study was constant . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease period between the patients resulting from use of a combined end result , the clin@@ ically significant changes taking place in the 6 @-@ minute walk , the range of the Schul@@ ter@@ gel@@ en@@ ks AH@@ I and ten@@ sharp@@ ness ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase @-@ 2 study was conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their intake in the study ( 16 patients with the heavy sk@@ ating form ) .
&quot; for four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 R / kg in the last 26 weeks to 200 R / kg in the last 26 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been determined after the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and every 4 patients with the moderate @-@ rate form showed only limited , or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
in a Phase 4 study studies of pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata were carried out on the G@@ ag mirror in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walking test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , a reasonable alternative ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two faculty schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate all new information that will be available every year , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged 5 years was similar to older and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , or is likely to be easily removed from other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ignant or metastatic &quot; non @-@ cl@@ ums@@ y &quot; lung cancer , which does not apply the epitheli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously have previously received other chemotherapy as a sole therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered along with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drug against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent an hydr@@ ation lack ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood picture changes or occur when certain other side effects should occur , the treatment should be reduced , reduced or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ els slo@@ ws down , thus the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug through and a longer life time in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the painter Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study has been treated to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( a further drug against cancer ) , in combination with Cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study on 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived at an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months during the all @-@ administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; patients who previously received chemotherapy was the average survival with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients , in which cancer is not attacked the turn@@ out cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival times than with the compar@@ atively medicine . &quot;

AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown to treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ sensitive bron@@ chi@@ al car@@ cin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² CO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in case of patients with non @-@ sensitive bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ac disease , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² CO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin actions , the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift as well as the day after treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ oid are given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose , P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 c@@ anned fo@@ lic acid and the intake must be continued during the entire duration of therapy as well as for further 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ gram ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as after each third respon@@ - hand@@ cycle .
&quot; in patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be created prior to each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thy@@ roid . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , A@@ part@@ at @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be a &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle a tin @-@ examination must take place under Ber@@ ück@@ ing of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the forec@@ ast@@ ering treatment .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mono@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 blood pressure .
&quot; should patients not develop @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity ≥ Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy needs to be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient gets the value before treatment . &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be broken when in patients after 2 Dos@@ is@@ reduction toxicity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity degrees 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued with the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or in comparison to patients aged 65 years an increased secondary risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because of non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ consistency and effectiveness .
in clinical trials in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min there were no tin customiz@@ ations necessary to go over the recommended Dos@@ age adap@@ tations to all patients .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of under 45 ml / min was not adequate ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
however patients were examined with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 times of the upper limit value and / or Trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ tion of &gt; the 3.2 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( near liver metastatic breast ) or &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metastatic breast ) .
patients must be surve@@ yed with regard to the Kno@@ wing market and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ atel@@ ic figure again has a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ ism of cells has once again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ uter number and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity as they are observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; a lesser toxicity and a reduction of degrees 3 / 4 hem@@ i@@ th@@ mat@@ ology , f@@ eb@@ rile ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was observed if a pre @-@ treatment had taken place with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a preventive measure for reduction treatment @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ ids ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which a therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is provided , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s must be used with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ ten@@ tious hypertension or Diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space an dra@@ in@@ age of the result in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment shall be repeated . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dio attack , and zer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally when this substance was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ dant ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is conve@@ yed ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irreversible cran@@ ial - the reproductive capacity is composed by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment - g@@ ush to get advice on blocking systems . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can cause non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed breakdown with the result of a pro@@ long@@ ated occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advised if in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine acid in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed reads ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data regarding the potential for interaction with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ e x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , must be the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with ph@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the bar@@ gaining status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards ( Rati@@ o ) when the decision was taken to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant , but as with anti @-@ tim@@ ber@@ ths are expected to be made in the pregnancy severe birth def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if absolutely necessary and after careful dismantling of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irreversible damage of reproductive capacity is given by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , consult with regard to blocking the sperm count . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in sal@@ ted inf@@ ant may not be ruled out . &quot;

primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received pre @-@ treatment in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clinical @-@ relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ignant P@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the application of the Lun@@ atic Cancer Research Centre in AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ Arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the sole Cis@@ pl@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms rose by an improvement of the pul@@ mon@@ ary parameters in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin @-@ arm and a di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment of pul@@ mon@@ gers in the course of time in the controversy .

&quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( Body Mass Index - BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , fatty food . &quot;
patients who are taking up the All@@ i and have no weight @-@ taking after 12 weeks should contact their physician or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are inhi@@ bited , they can not disman@@ tle some fats in food , thereby causing a quarter of the inf@@ led fats of un@@ aut the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was overweight with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies on patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients had acquired an average weight loss of 4,@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg in the intake of placebo . &quot;
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 there could be no loss of weight loss of weight loss .

&quot; it must not be used in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( for preventing the organ of transplan@@ tation by transplan@@ ts ) , or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; it must also be not applied in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ onic syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are taken from the digestive tract ) or to chol@@ est@@ ase ( a liver illness ) , and with pregnant or breastfeeding mothers . &quot;

alli is inde@@ b@@ ted to weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal or fet@@ al diet .
&quot; it is not to be used by children and young people under 18 , because not enough data is available for effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ list@@ ate is only minimal absorbed in elders , and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likelihood of occurrence of occurrence of intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if alli is taken together with a gre@@ ase intake of fat or fat @-@ rich nutrition .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a drug against diabetes before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic can be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take care as well as drugs against hypertension or have increased cholesterol levels should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage needs to be adjusted .
&quot; it is recommended to make additional fluctu@@ ations of measures to meet , in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible claims of or@@ ical contrac@@ eption ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ ate and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed one of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bar .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with Or@@ list@@ ate , the Quick @-@ values could be influenced ( international norm@@ aly rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients who were treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ ate , the concentrations of the vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ enes . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be recommended before bed@@ time a supplement of the mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure an adequate vit@@ amine ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a unique dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , a limited number of healthy volunteers , which at the same time received Or@@ list@@ ate , a minor decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; zo@@ experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of or@@ list@@ ate are mainly g@@ astro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug by means of having the absorption of bi@@ ased fat .
the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg for a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easily and temporarily .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( incidence based on the available data is not neg@@ li@@ gible ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of those side @-@ known side effects which were found after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli made for conversion in view of possible or true g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects can lead .
single d@@ ants of 800 mg / list@@ ate and multi@@ fac@@ ili@@ es of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered for over a period of 15 days at normal and overweight pro@@ val that occurred without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by or@@ list@@ ate , either no side effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; based on the investigations on humans and animals , the effects of a rapid de@@ formation of systemic effects can be attributed to the li@@ tic properties of Or@@ list@@ ate . &quot;
the therapeutic effect uses in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper fertilizer @-@ intest@@ ine by kov@@ al@@ ente bond to the active Ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ str@@ ati@@ cal and pan@@ ni@@ cal lights .
&quot; clinical trials were derived from 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , three times a day , the absorption of about 25 % of the food is blocked . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , plac@@ e@@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of orbit , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cris@@ or@@ ical , fatty food . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the variation of the body weight opposite the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in the body weight course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg -@@ 2,@@ 4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol in with Or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change @-@ circum@@ ference amoun@@ ted to 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ ate 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ ate were not measurable 8 hours following the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ ate ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , for therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages in plasma was not only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ l ) and without signs of Kum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients which was administered into the minimal toler@@ able dose , the M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ si@@ ed Lac@@ ton@@ rings ) and M3 ( M1 after deriv@@ ative of the N @-@ form@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine group ) identified the approximate 42 % of the total plas@@ mac@@ a concentration . &quot;

alli is the weight reduction of weight reduction and is applied for overweight adults aged 18 years with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or beyond . alli gains should be used in conjunction with a fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight in relation to your body size or are overweight .
&quot; even if these diseases first do not lead to that you feel uncomfortable , you should nevertheless ask your doctor for check@@ check@@ up . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight , which you can take in the frame of a diet , you can lose an extra bed with the help of alli . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;

&quot; when you leave a meal or contains a meal no fat , take no capsule . alli can only work when food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in combination with a meal that contains too much fat , risk nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to the new eating habits , you start already before the first capsule with a cold and fet@@ ching diet . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries are effective as you can comprehend how much you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your diet habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight , you should define in advance two daily objectives : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; nour@@ ish yourself fet@@ ched , to decrease the likelihood of nutritional supplements ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot;
remember to ask your doctor if you are not used to exercise physical activity . • St@@ ay during the intake and also after termination of the intake of alli physically active .
• alli cannot be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can determine no reduction of your weight after twelve weeks use of alli , please consult your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under circumstances you must end the intake of alli . • At a successful weight loss , it is not about to switch off diet and return to old habits again . &quot;

the most common side effects hang together with the effectiveness of the capsules together and thus arise that increases fat out of the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after treatment of treatment because at this time you may not have consistently reduced the li@@ posuction share in the diet .
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ inside you already several days , or better one week , before the first intake of capsules with a fet@@ al diet . • learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite food and about the size of the portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , sin@@ es the likelihood that you are going to exceed your fat limit . • If you share your recommended fat amounts even@@ ly on your daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may have to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ sufficient capital or a good after@@ ward appearance , as you may possibly occur with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these esc@@ ences occur , they learn to control the time through adaptation of their diets . &quot;
&quot; • Buy drugs for children un@@ accessible . • You may not apply to the expiry date specified on the expiry date of expiry . • The bottle has two white seal tanks with sili@@ ca@@ gel which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk for the emergence of various severe diseases such as : • hypertension • diabetes • cancer cases • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis speaking to your doctor about your risk for these disorders .
&quot; lasting weight reduction , for instance by improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent a serious risk of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and learn to eat permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in the kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ le , which you can also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake offers how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the below listed below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with every meal .
&quot; which quantity for you is suitable , take the number of calories below which is suitable for you . • Due to the effect of the capsule is the compliance with the recommended fat intake . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat to yourself as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by keeping the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight decrease and at the same time dimin@@ ished the likelihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to step @-@ gradually and continuously . &quot;
34 These decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight and continuously approximately 0.5 kg per week to lose weight without frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you burn through motion daily 150 k@@ cal , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For sustained weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ ori@@ ents and fats and also adhere to this . • useful is a nutritional diary with information about cal@@ ori@@ zation and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you begin with the intake of alli . &quot;
&quot; the alli program for supporting the weight loading combined the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information material that can help you feed and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with a tailored program for the support of weight delivery , you can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and to achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( as Cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as with chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ar@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a drug which can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
&quot; the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended , as the effects in this age group does not exist enough information . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , prevents the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy reg@@ isters , which are powerful or moderate rede@@ em@@ ers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chemotherapy who are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chemotherapy who are excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with alo@@ xi in 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 15@@ 3 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared 69 % of with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
compared with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission signed the company Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a permit for the in@@ transport of Alo@@ xi all over the European Union . &quot;
al@@ xi is indic@@ ative : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting at strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy because of a cancer disease and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting at moder@@ ated chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be reinforced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can prolong the col@@ on age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub @-@ jack@@ ets to the injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 @-@ antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable while using Pal@@ on@@ otic tron with medicines that prolon@@ gs the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or tend to be an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemical psych@@ otherap@@ ist , Alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy was neither used for prevention , nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials inhibit@@ ory Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron is not inhibit@@ ory activity of the five examined chem@@ otherap@@ ists ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ar@@ , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a sing@@ ular intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of the met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pr@@ ami@@ ds , one C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ ine , hal@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , hal@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , hal@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , hal@@ i@@ ti@@ dine , k@@ ine@@ tic , k@@ ox@@ al@@ in , ser@@ ve@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron . &quot;
&quot; experience on the application of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on human pregn@@ ancies are not present , so Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron should not be applied with s@@ ang@@ ers , unless it is considered necessary by the treating doctor . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ gram to observe side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with alo@@ xi related to headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions to the administration ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , there were similar frequencies of unwanted events such as in the other worlds ; there were no dose of working relationships . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out , due to large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in a Alo@@ e over@@ do@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients were received with &lt; 50 mg / m2 cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ar@@ ine ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , that was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ar@@ ine and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , that were given on day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ ed chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls comparable to the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ co possesses the ability to block the ion channels at v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization involved and extend the duration of the promotion potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study was conducted at 221 healthy volunteers , the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ BC admin@@ ton Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in individual d@@ oses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
reset After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initial decrease of Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations a slow eli@@ ation of the body with an average time @-@ time half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plas@@ mac@@ a centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentrate time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire Dos@@ age range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg with gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ propor@@ tionally .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average of 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ cin@@ oma between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ otic @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; due to pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that the value of 0.@@ 75 mg of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron is comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) with the value of 0.@@ 75 mg of measured value ; however , the C@@ max is higher than 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and some further 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies at the Met@@ abol@@ ization have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ sto@@ C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ co are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous individual dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron were found approximately 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron as un@@ altered active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ ting injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearing 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver disorder the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation sh@@ al@@ b@@ wer@@ time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron increases , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered adequate over the maximum human@@ ic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre@@ clinical trials indicate that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can only block in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ pol@@ arization and may extend the potential for action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ ples of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ins Ne@@ oplas@@ tics ( in thy@@ roid , pitu@@ itary gland ) and skin tum@@ ors at rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but due to the high doses used and since alo@@ xi used to be a unique application , the relevance of these results is being valued as to human beings . &quot;
the holder of this approval for the in@@ duction must be informed by the European Commission on the plans for the in@@ transport process as part of this decision approved .

June 2006 The Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative value in which the approval of the approval for the induc@@ ing of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C intended for treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting solution was recommended .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar to the same practitioner &apos;s eff@@ ec@@ tual constitu@@ ents , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; Re@@ ference Aid &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one by a viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic investigation , the liver tissue uses damage , in addition , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in- and neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters ( AL@@ T ) are increasing in the blood circulation . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which one gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which is stimulating to the formation of the substance . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that cover the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug through , effectiveness , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference dose by means of 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 out of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after hi@@ ring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 e @-@ mail : / / www.@@ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is .
&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in detail that the data on the stability of the substance and the drug is not sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar to the clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon flame retar@@ ded the disease in more patients than with the reference practitioner , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was conducted in the study to study the question , to what extent the drug uses an immune response ( i.e. the body forms anti@@ body - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of th@@ peti@@ go ( one with cr@@ ust formation ) , and small infected in@@ infected in@@ dis@@ ations ( cr@@ acking or chi@@ cks ) , de@@ parts and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been veri@@ fiable or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ toxic@@ ente st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because aler@@ go against these kinds of infections may not affect .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months but patients under 18 years of age may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
&quot; if the patient does not speak to treatment two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
&quot; it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ses ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle , in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was deduc@@ ted after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ asser , Al@@ tar@@ go and c@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with Hau@@ tw@@ asser , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( vain cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or infections , which have demonstr@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA , are not effective enough . &quot;
the com@@ mon@@ est side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the client .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go can ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the following superficial skin infections towards the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • in@@ infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , di@@ lig@@ ations , or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
may 2007 the European Commission shared the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the failure of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with which no improvement can be looked after within two or three days therefore should be investigated once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; in case of an awareness or severe local irritation through the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is abandoned , the anoin@@ ting will be careful and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or is assumed ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical studies at secondary @-@ open wounds was the effectiveness of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ardi@@ zed st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy is to be considered if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or degradation of the infected body occurs .
the impact of simultaneous application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means at the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ations , which have been reached with people after topical skin or infected with superficial wounds , a clin@@ ically relevant shirt in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the medium Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to top@@ most application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ be on the poor skin of healthy adult men around 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , tin customiz@@ ations are not required for required when topical ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a re@@ produc@@ tion@@ sto@@ icity after oral intake and are inadequate in terms of a statement regarding the birth and the feder@@ ate / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied only during pregnancy when an top@@ ographic anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is to be prefer@@ able in the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the breastfeeding continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continued / ended , between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most common ad@@ jun@@ cture of irritation in the place of place , which looked about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is passive by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction with a certain bin@@ ders of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the bin@@ ders of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ agi@@ cally anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the bonds ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales protein L@@ 3 is involved and is in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bin@@ der and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by li@@ aison at this bin@@ ders point inhibit@@ ing P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ ut@@ line , block partial inter@@ locking interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ aler under@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local prevalence of resistance , the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin appear in at least some infectious forms , a consultation should be pursued through experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to Meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional virus factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din should be considered . &quot;
reset In a study with healthy adults was rated 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ ine daily using oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to the top@@ ographic treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plastic were generated . &quot;
sampling was carried out during the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in particular before the mediation and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system absorption in people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP Hem@@ hal@@ ation .

&quot; in studies for oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid particles . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female genital signs of reduced fertility with oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby one up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 on poor skin : &quot;
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study on rats were observed in oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ fold of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ icity ( decreased body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ern@@ ale toxicity . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which concern the liver ) for children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used in the context of one of two doses of existing vaccines , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix can only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that it can end from two doses existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose is desired for hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines have an effect on the immune system ( the natural def@@ ender of the body ) , &quot; how it can defend against illness . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix incorpor@@ ates the same components as the Ad@@ rix Ad@@ rix Ad@@ rix which has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 : Twin@@ rix Children .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix Ad@@ rix and Twin@@ rix Children are administered as part of three doses existing in the existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also used as proof of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s use . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection a protective anti@@ body concentration .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 months distance between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix led children between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection to develop protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection from Ambi@@ rix had a six @-@ month and at a 12 months distance between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the inj@@ ector , redness , mat@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as emp@@ t@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients in one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 brought the European Commission to the Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the iner@@ ation of Ambi@@ rix throughout the world
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is given to the appointment of the choice and the second dose between six and 12 months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her chim@@ era is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines or with a combination of combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B @-@ virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) anti@@ body values lie in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vaccines .
&quot; it is still not completely safegu@@ ar@@ ded whether immun@@ ologically speaking individuals who have addressed to a Hepatitis C vaccine , as they are also protected at no longer det@@ ectable antibodies as they are also protected by immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 How with all injections should be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine appropriate possibilities for medical treatment and supervision are always available .
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the stand@@ ardis@@ ation scheme will be recommended using the combination of hepatitis B @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ antes hepatitis @-@ B surface surface . &quot;
&quot; at Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body , so in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ inations can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could lead to an optimal imp@@ rec@@ tor , these injections should be avoided . &quot;
in these cases Ambi@@ rix cannot be inj@@ ected at a compar@@ atively sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding .
if Ambi@@ rix had administered in the second life year in the form of a separate inj@@ ected - tet@@ ell@@ ular Persian ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps cluster ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immun@@ def@@ ective must be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study that was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , Mat@@ ty , Gast@@ ro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headaches and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed when earlier Thi@@ om@@ mes and preserv@@ atives . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 and including 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix had been compared with the 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ iness on a calculation basis per vacc@@ inations in Ambi@@ rix , but not on one calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % compared to the testing of a dose of 3 @-@ doses of the vaccine .
&quot; after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , which was administered by Ambi@@ rix , about pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % in the pros that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ tin combination . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of matri@@ mon@@ ality was comparable high ( i.e. above the entire vaccines at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the Pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix got , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the pros that received the 3 @-@ doses combination . &quot;
the frequency of distinctive pain and Mat@@ ernity was small and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination of the result of the 3 @-@ doses vaccine .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines , the occurrence of local transactions and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface surface . &quot;
&quot; at the 6@@ - to 11@@ - age of age , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix had a frequent appearance of pain ( at the inj@@ ure place ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ inations , associated with severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis C surface , it was not different . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were per month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , for the month of 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 years of age , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination of three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 persons , whose immun@@ o@@ ogen@@ icity was worth@@ less , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ op@@ rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the gift of 3 @-@ tin containers were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study from 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ year after termination of the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the table below . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vaccine with a combined vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface surface .
individuals who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old could have proven the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over a minimum of 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 month period .
the immun@@ ode@@ ficiency immun@@ re@@ action against both anti@@ gens compared to the vaccine administered after vaccination of 3 doses with a Com@@ bin@@ der vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ in@@ activated Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 years of age could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccination scheme is comparable to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months .
&quot; if the first dose was administered in the second life of life at the same time with the refres@@ her inf@@ ecting of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , az@@ ell@@ ular Persian ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ m@@ umps vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask @-@ m@@ umps vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed for the present formulation similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ or and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion rates , as for the earlier formulation . &quot;

&quot; hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in water de@@ filed waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a flas@@ hy face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix cannot be completely protected from infection with hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B virus infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels / feels ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections affecting the liver or symptoms , which are similar to those of a Hepatitis C or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves through ju@@ ck@@ ening skin attacks , breathing emergency or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the planned administration of the second vaccination dosage ) . &quot;
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis C / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dose ( 360 ELISA test ) of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a viable hepatitis B surface surface . &quot;
the second vaccination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually administered for one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection against the vaccines .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood pressure disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle tissue . • If you are weak / your child due to a condition or treatment in your / its body &apos;s resistance , or if you / your child sub@@ mits to a hem@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons to the vaccine may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to the vaccine is .
21 Sa@@ ver to your doctor if you / your child will take another medicine / include ( including those who have been unable to receive without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated or have been administered or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administered / or this in the near future is planned .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate points and as many different limbs . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix had administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine is still sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women are not administered , except it is urgently needed that they may be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you have been an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packaging to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that have become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the in@@ circulation , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefits risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix had only been placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data is limited to this medicine due to low patient exposure . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with endo@@ cr@@ ine endo@@ cr@@ ine defect , or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ oton@@ ous En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ concentrations ) in the pre @-@ history . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is distributed - split into several single pants with meals - swal@@ lowed , under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ ella does not work with any other treatment or with placebo ( a hypo@@ cris@@ y medicine , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also lead to loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , irritation , fluids , mal@@ e@@ ability , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , in@@ convenient body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ y in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ moni@@ tions are effectively prevented .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the condition at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indic@@ ative in all patients , with which a complete endo@@ cr@@ ine deficiency already manifested in the re @-@ born old ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fixed form ( in@@ complete endo@@ cr@@ ine def@@ ective , which consists of the first life @-@ month ) then there is an indication of the use when in An@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ic En@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low pills or for patients with lo@@ op@@ ia is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated considering the protein intolerance and the necessary daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg ( 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or arg@@ in@@ thin@@ trans @-@ o@@ carb@@ ons , the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with an arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must be arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered in patients with lo@@ op@@ sy , as a risk for the emergence of eco @-@ ho@@ gan@@ y sh@@ ed@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , when the tablets enter not immediately into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium and wast@@ age @-@ based clinical conditions only with caution .
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kidneys occur , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure , only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a distorted loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a hesit@@ ated irritation of cer@@ ebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS stood at 56 % of patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they did not associate with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , severe hypo@@ cal@@ a@@ emia , pancre@@ atic N@@ europ@@ athy and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old small child with a wasted single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day a dose of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic link which is contra@@ ven@@ ed by acet@@ yl@@ otic with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is left over the kidneys .
&quot; St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both connections contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen . &quot;
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary Cycle can be accepted that for each gram uni@@ denti@@ als Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ ate is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is important that the diagnosis is early and the treatment is being started immediately , in order to improve survival chances and the clinical result . &quot;
&quot; the prognosis of the early @-@ proof form of the disease with the appearance of first symptoms in the re @-@ born old age was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease himself led to death with per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alo@@ ga during the first year of life . &quot;
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ex@@ cre@@ ase ( sodium in@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ri@@ um@@ ben@@ zo@@ at and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , prot@@ ein@@ reduced c@@ ost and possibly substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new @-@ born diseases on 80 % within the first month of life . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease were diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates were 100 % , but even with these patients it was time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ soli@@ ds form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of or@@ ni@@ in@@ yl trans@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ial en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then permanently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ectable diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological shortcomings are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ stru@@ ed in liver and kidney pol@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ishes in plasma and urine were determined after the gift of a single dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at among so@@ ber @-@ metabolism and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis after single transmission and repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses from up to 20 g / day ( not controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its Met@@ abol@@ ishes was also examined in cancer patients by intraven@@ ous gift by sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tab@@ le@@ form were determined 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders or hem@@ o@@ do@@ bin@@ s was subject to different doses Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting is no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma .
&quot; in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations on the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is carried out within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of con@@ ju@@ erect product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ancy and children , who can do not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with slip problems ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ either , or a nose @-@ son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; after previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg ( 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ching @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early @-@ proof lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or arg@@ in@@ thin@@ trans @-@ o@@ carb@@ ons , the substitution of Cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) Nat@@ al per gram Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2,5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat feder@@ ate were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain . &quot;
&quot; a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tical patient , which developed a metabolic encephal@@ opathy , severe hypo@@ cal@@ a@@ emia , pancre@@ atic N@@ europ@@ athy and Pan@@ cre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; ste@@ e@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess . &quot;
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary fec@@ ycle may be assumed that for each gram can be produced sodium in@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ic glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
already existing neurological shortcomings are also hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur .
after an oral dose of 5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form there were 15 minutes after taking measurable plastic concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this action the small measuring spo@@ on 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use also in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , there are certain liver enzymes , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ ck@@ ent waste products that can occur after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period you are not allowed to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because the drug can skip to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , con@@ cre@@ teness , head@@ ache , taste distur@@ ban@@ ces , indul@@ gence of o@@ cr@@ acy , Des@@ tru@@ er@@ edness , remin@@ ders and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , you immediately sit with your doctor or using the emergency room of your hospital for the introduction of appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed to same individual pants ( hose , which runs through the abdom@@ inal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose @-@ son@@ de ( hose , which is led through the nose in the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • remove from the container a le@@ as@@ po@@ on of gran@@ ulate . • St@@ range a straight edge , for example a knife on the edge of the Mess@@ l@@ ener to remove excess gran@@ ules . • The recommended number of Mess@@ l@@ po@@ on gran@@ ules is equivalent to a measuring spo@@ on . • check the recommended number of Mess@@ l@@ po@@ on granite from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox will be applied for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example under inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest , with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ g ( cardi@@ ac disease ) without &quot; ST@@ - H@@ ating &quot; ( an anom@@ aly ) at the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or EC@@ G . &quot;
&quot; if applied is applied to the prevention of blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients took part in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ ine / II@@ IA / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with He@@ et@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI was often used to patients a p@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arteries , to prevent a closure ) , and they were additionally received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without gift from GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , cardi@@ ac disease or recur@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as effectively as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who have subjected to PCI was An@@ gi@@ ox in relation to all indicators just as effective as he@@ et@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , with which it was significantly more effective than ha@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ er@@ u@@ dine , other stags or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also be applied to patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney infection or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ itarian Medicine ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during one PCI is a substitute replacement for s@@ par@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission signed the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd provides approval for the in@@ transport of angi@@ ox across the European Union . &quot;
for treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile anxiety ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) at an emergency attack or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt should be increased from 0.5 mg / kg and increases in@@ fusion for duration of surgery to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; after PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a fixing is administered from 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ ster of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a few Bol@@ us @-@ Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to 225 seconds , should be carried out a second cable carrier of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence lower ACT values , the re @-@ constituted and di@@ lution medicines should be carefully mixed before the application and the bol@@ d@@ osis is quickly given intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney penetration ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which will be subjected to PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is below 225 seconds , a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis is to be administered from 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and re@@ viewing the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) that resulted in the approval , the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without tin @-@ adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous Gift of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ned armies or 8 hours after termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of low @-@ molecular armies .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against deer • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a disorder of hem@@ ost@@ as@@ es@@ ystems and / or irreversible bacterial infection . • severe un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able hyper@@ ton@@ ic acid and sub@@ aly@@ sis patients ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
&quot; patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of blood pressure , especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; even though at PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine most blood vessels can occur in arter@@ ial points , in patients who undergo a per@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ act ( PCI ) , during the treatment in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients , the war@@ far@@ in and with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be considered , to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should once again reach the level of treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ at , war@@ far@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tika or thro@@ mbo@@ genic aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , it can be assumed that these active ingredients raise the blood . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine with thy@@ roid aggreg@@ ation@@ , or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters are regularly monitored in any case . &quot;
&quot; the e@@ experimental investigations are inadequate in terms of the effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see below 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone ; 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ized to either im@@ min@@ ted pi@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ ine plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine group as well as in the patients treated with he@@ als and patients over 65 years of age came more frequently to unwanted events than in male or younger patients .
heavy bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and TI@@ MI &apos;s standards for heavy bleeding as defined in table 2 .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine alone considerably less frequently than in the groups with he@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or and bi@@ vali@@ dated plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy plat@@ o@@ ung was defined as one of the following events : in@@ contrac@@ ular , intra@@ o@@ cular blood vessels or blood flow in the point of point , a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ atom@@ a of ≥ 3 g / d@@ l with known blood flow , re@@ traction due to a blood flow , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine at 6000 patients who are subjected to PCI .
&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine Group as well as in the groups treated with he@@ als , it came in women and patients over 65 years more often in adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding found under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine significant less frequently than in the comparison group below he@@ et@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ inhibit@@ or .
following side effects which are not listed above were reported after comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to system organic classes in table 6 summ@@ arized .

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children starting six years with diabetes that need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is an illness where the body does not produce enough insulin in the blood of the Glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin is not effective .
&quot; insulin is very slightly different to human@@ ly , and the change means that it appears faster and has a shorter effect of life than a short @-@ term Human@@ ité . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was used in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin gene in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body does not produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; for type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body insulin is not effective , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adult . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ zed hem@@ ost@@ al ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study involving adults with type @-@ 1 diabetes has been found after six months a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration amoun@@ ted to 0.@@ 46 % after six months with ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal age .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra must not be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other components , or in patients who have already suffered from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of Ap@@ id@@ ra must possibly be adjusted , if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose level . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission signed the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH to approve the use of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the field of abdom@@ en or the secre@@ tion or the del@@ etes or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the field of abdom@@ inal bags .
&quot; due to the decreased glucose capacity and dimin@@ ished insulin change , the insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the strength , the brand ( Her@@ - writer ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ised , etc ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , in particular in patients with an in @-@ insulin diabetes , may lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ box ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin , or insulin is supposed to take place under strict medical supervision , and can make a change of dosage . &quot;
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change to change the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; on the substances that increase blood sugar and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ ine include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic enzymes , fibro@@ us pyramid , tri@@ angular pyramid , tri@@ po@@ xy@@ s , tri@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ ali@@ zy@@ na and sul@@ fon@@ ation antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ ol@@ y@@ tika such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ in , gu@@ ano @-@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ der@@ ers are de@@ ported or missing . &quot;
Animal Experim@@ ental Studies of the Re@@ productive Tox@@ icity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ities in terms of pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin occurs in the human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin occurs neither in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; in the following are those from clinical studies known to those undes@@ irable drug actions , group@@ ed according to system organic classes and sorted according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( incidence on the basis of the inf@@ ant data is not neg@@ li@@ gible ) . &quot;

&quot; licensing ystro@@ phy , the injection of injection within the inj@@ ector , can occur in the episode of a Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy on the injection place . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ vities with consci@@ ences can be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by an appropriately trained person or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin cuts the blood sugar by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing the glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be done faster and the time is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ ly normal .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes ( type 2 / kg ) in therapeu@@ tically relevant doses of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , one to the dose of dis@@ proportion@@ ality effects , and with 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose effects , just like human@@ eness . &quot;
insulin ul@@ l@@ ul@@ um has twice as fast efficiency as normal human and achieves complete glucose effects about 2 hours earlier than humanity .
&quot; from the dates , it was obvious that in an application of insulin ul@@ cer@@ ous in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached as with human normal age , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin R@@ ul@@ l@@ ul@@ um was reached in 2 minutes before meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ ger control than with human normal age , was given 2 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin is wasted in 15 minutes at the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as with human normal age , which is given 2 mi@@ xes before the meal ( see figure 1 ) . &quot;
insulin delivery time at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - formerly ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal age that was given 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) and compared to human normal age that was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Northern Uganda that was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
