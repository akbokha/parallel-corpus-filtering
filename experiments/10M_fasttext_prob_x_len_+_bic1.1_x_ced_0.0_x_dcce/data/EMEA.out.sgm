<seg id="11">Aripiprazole probably appears above all as "participatory agonist" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripipozole, such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than neurotransmitters works to enable the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"da dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and its recurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, preventing recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of injection resolution has been compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia, or similar diseases, compared to increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>

<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injection resolution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, received a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in use for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify has decreased in four of the five short-time studies more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Abilify fettered also up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes with previously treated patients, and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms strained unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify to capture (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrappyramid, headaches, blurred secretion (constipation), gradation (dropping), softening (constipation), softening (dropping), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeping disorders), insomnia (sleeping disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanitarian Medicine (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-severe to severe manic episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the Ottoman episodes had to weigh on the treatment with Aripipozole, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injections in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia, or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable to overlull the risks."</seg>
