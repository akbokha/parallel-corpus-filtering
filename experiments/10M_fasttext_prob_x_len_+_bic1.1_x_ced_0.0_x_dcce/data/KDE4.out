&quot; package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some features of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; by which it is easier to use . &quot;
more information about using &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual or Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; select Settings extensions , open the card menu tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of standard settings modules from the package k@@ de ; add @-@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are on your system , if you have any additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , which contains &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
&quot; the module mapping filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter filters . with the module you can filter &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; it &apos;s up @-@ to @-@ date working directory in different ways . &quot;
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree @-@ view in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to use ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document . as default , the display starts with the root node of the document , example : document@@ ations , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root sp@@ leen . &quot;
&quot; module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ bar and text views , to view the contents of your local file system . &quot;
&quot; the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of representing the folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ map . each object is displayed by a rec@@ tan@@ gle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , the size of a folder can be easily detected , as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command can be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ ff representation of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles provides meaningful color and let@@ tering settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched on color mode , can be either depth for the easy detection of the prescri@@ ptions or the illustration of another file @-@ file such as name , owners , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can specify , if there is enough space to display , only if there is enough space to display at all , or if the surface of sub@@ ordinate spelling occurs ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; for pedal algorithms for tre@@ ad@@ aps , the rule should be respected that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the tre@@ ad@@ in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always respected . note that the sub@@ ordinate entries are no longer available . note that less space for the frame is lost , if the square is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation will be made available to the fitting and to prevent space losses by setting the space that rec@@ tan@@ gles which are as square . the best methods of this are lines , columns , or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimum display area for an entry over the menu item view App@@ ly . instead , a smoking pattern is drawn into the area of the higher level of order to indicate that this area is actually occupied by an associated entry . &quot;

&quot; publication came ; represents a lumin@@ table available in a separate window , with which you can easily compare pictures . he works with all supported image data formats , also raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em lumin@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its windows open . if you are back in &amp; checking ; main window , you can quickly open the lighthouse with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the thumb@@ nails you can compare the images that you want to compare , to the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is displayed . thus , you can choose the same area of the two images too . so you can compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to select quickly from a picture series . if you are using p@@ air@@ wise navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the left mouse button is automatically displayed in the fields below . now , the left mouse button is displayed in the right area . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ dering actions are also working directly from the illumin@@ ants such as F@@ 4 file Edit .... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the lumin@@ table . this makes it easy for example to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can recognize at the crossed arrows . to squee@@ ze the visible range of the image , you need to press these to and the &amp; L@@ MB ; keep in the mode of preview , then both images show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ regul@@ ator under the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; scroll to zoom in and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are preview in the game .
&quot; what is a digital display Management - apart from the fashion point ? digital invent@@ ories looked at every part of the process , following the picture was taken up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos recorded , sc@@ anned or digital photos se@@ duc@@ ts a form of digital display . however , most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , you will set up and use photos again . we consider downloading , convert , backup , evaluate , review , review , wait and export images . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , categ@@ orized , is seeking , transforms , transforming and exported contents which have a mon@@ ary or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata must be used according to your definition data that may provide information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you can find out more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you need not even know how many photos you did . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely will not use &amp; publication either for you to access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know what to maintain in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be stored on your computer , whether you want to save it onto a fourth drive or on a network point &amp; etc ; notice that you will eventually have to switch to a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll be happy with this structure . dwelling can be quickly found through your location location , unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you have enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is a folder for images that you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant access from images to various topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure to this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile processing easier . separate new ones of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option to store the met@@ adata page in &amp; checking ; this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written to the file . if you forget this , then you can easily convert the met@@ adata to the database by selecting the corresponding point in the menu album . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information about your database , but what happens if you want which to change ? this provides &amp; publication ; they provide a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select every photo keywords , let@@ tering and a review . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then put the value then . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as well as with other programs often called , or categories continue . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
if you import kat@@ alogue images from another source with embedded key@@ word then &amp; checking came ; automatically the tree for you to build b@@ z@@ w the images to the right place . the changed keywords will be done by &amp; publication ; updated while the sub @-@ trees are pro@@ secuted .
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata is cut out , since each block of met@@ adata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ame and calendar data are characteristics of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough the keywords - the next section refers to label or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from a distance not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the square . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you this is the Al@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! one begins to dream , associations , the historical period is again present , you might even hear the silence . the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider the title may be more important than the picture itself to generate an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help Him via the motif you &apos;re moving to understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok if an image is not perfect , if the strength has only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can use any number of text in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , when lab@@ eling it . K@@ DE will even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even use it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even give you a rec@@ tan@@ ker according to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you have to tell the story for the opening @-@ lo@@ op@@ ting not a second time . &quot;
do you have to remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ olo@@ uring are already un@@ coun@@ table and will be in the future even deeper . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can visu@@ alize your travels with geographical references . you can also export the photos at the entrance location . you can also export the photos at G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewers . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a game of copyright and calls for copy@@ rights to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions , i.e. also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information comes in the interior page of &amp; publication ; when information is stored :
&quot; the author ( syn@@ onym for creator and Writ@@ er ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who has created the photo , for example , the name of a company or organisation is used , then it should not be changed once more . this field does not support comm@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; title : associated with the author . this field contains the working copy of the photographer . examples for this can be title as : An@@ nam@@ ter photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a reference to the author field , this must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily be the author . if the photographer is responsible for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a stock photo , then the picture / agency is offered here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has no little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , delete or change the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important against it . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ marks is unique per image unique . &amp; checking , will be such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future . &quot;
&quot; topics : record label , black@@ outs , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , b@@ ast , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we are not talking about CDs that have been lost on the street or fire . these kinds of losses are the same which can happen to you in traditional pap@@ er@@ images or neg@@ atives . in this section it is about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the biggest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes a loss of data . &quot;
to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs must be treated and you may no longer trust than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archives . of course there are offers of gold coated DVDs that claim more difficult and much more expensive . if you believe it is in your measurable room .
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be im@@ legi@@ ble , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good reception equipment . the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheapest but you write a lot of reliable . so it is about choosing the right choice . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to error , even if you were just written first . therefore , they use a control mechanism to protect yourself . despite this massive protection they are required for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs , there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that causes miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read the damaged data of damaged flo@@ ppies , hard disk drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
op@@ tic media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the For@@ mat@@ war against the HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost h@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual Lay@@ er DVD with 8.@@ 5 GB . everything that has been said to CDs and DVDs also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non@@ propri@@ ated format . then check out the media with a description , date &amp; author label and afterwards to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturing warranty cover a new disk , but not the data . Google represents a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard disk drives : dis@@ error study . &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks keep the longest if you are operated in the temper@@ ate range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . electronic parts of the controller are the most common troubles@@ hooting , SM@@ ART , these errors do not notice the most common failure . these are in particular Les@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and evac@@ uation . the expected lifetime of life amounts between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric power supply before you have secured the files , but these losses can normally be recovered without major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment does not constitute much power , the device with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors are different . these can cause severe damage to your computer . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against rap@@ tops is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that bin@@ ds a part of the energy heat and det . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in list , but remember that not every plug @-@ in also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an immer@@ sion protection , then you should be sure that he meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to protecting it against ligh@@ tening and thereby protecting the right devices . &quot;
&quot; as a over@@ voltage each cable can use to your computer , you should be sure that also all the periph@@ er@@ als can be connected to your system . some manufacturers set up over@@ voltage support that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks , and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects against smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even an accident of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful in dis@@ ruption @-@ free power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting head@@ ings , these devices can automatically launch cordless energy when a black@@ out occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system again . if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concern the potential risk that your computer system is exposed and and compare its safety in electric problems with the costs for avoiding this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection may be you up to &amp; euro ; 20 cost , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your calcul@@ ator is protected . at the end you should remember all the cables go back before you go into the holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to save it as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can save any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; you are very expensive compared to the hard disk drives , however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of key images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com make online storage services available to pictures . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 each year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked only in reality . &quot;
&quot; due to the view of the data backup , the Web @-@ solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically re@@ united thanks to the TCP protocol and is included in the offer of a backup and a shared memory . this makes them easier . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem and b@@ tr@@ ance provide at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing is that no one says when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ detected until you have destroyed a photo and this to your surprise is destroyed . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than the inside your machine . &quot;
un@@ reliable power supply are another source of transmission loss as they produce inter@@ ferences within the data flows . normal data systems remain un@@ noticed .
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle turn@@ tables at low levels and are highly scal@@ able . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has its own initiative with its b@@ aking file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same prot@@ ections and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the notebook and 46 % of the operating systems . not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft is already 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most popul@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; has long been spot@@ ted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , itinerary , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to name the wi@@ dened file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the course process at a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an in@@ defin@@ able status is avoided . however , a file is not completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical limits . it is meant that technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise @-@ characteristics are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and high quality optics have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . even DS@@ LR cameras require a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive is available today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make anyone else concerned for data loss . 6 % of all PCs is affected by a plan and test this backup before you do something more dangerous than the re@@ installation of your operating system to make exchange of records or the size of your hard disk drives .
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you get lucky when the drive was not connected in the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget flight un@@ glück@@ e : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are hazardous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the complete house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ .exe always means a not local storage . bring your back@@ ups to the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a more common reason for a loss of data despite safeguarding the panic . if you have a backup that is not available immediately , you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files is to be secured . it is a snapshot of history and represents a complete copy at a time .
difference protection : a backup of the files changed since the last full backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : that of the complete assurance and of the last differential .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files which have been changed since the last backup . you can re @-@ establish the original status at any time when such a backup was made . this backup comes the next one with the exception that only has been sealed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transmission trans@@ cri@@ es copies r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase security through ssh .
backup important pictures directly after you have saved them on your computer to DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this procedure lets you get enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come up with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for every month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visual devices , ... &quot;
&quot; so valuable pictures can survive the next 40 years that is about the time period in which you really are interested in , because they remember your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be observed : &quot;
&quot; as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you must look at all that is said today . unfortunately , there is no other option than having a certain wax . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system uses backwards . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available to everyone . if you have an old system important for reading your images , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and when necessary to convert a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means to enlarge .
let &apos;s go from that you plan the scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated record or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and move onto a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ warf if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them up . &quot;
&amp; T ; dd if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Quelle is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; F ; res@@ et@@ res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; Ds ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of travel needs if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software you can read it then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
&quot; G@@ IF is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard developed by G@@ IF , but it can save much more . P@@ NG can save gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ cs data for improved colour instruction at hetero@@ genic platforms . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF needs and a slow personal expression . this format we would like to save you to store your images . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely distributed as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ zi@@ pped form or in a container with a loss of free compression salt ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there is a problem however that this format is adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licensed and open @-@ format that was developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed on the TI@@ FF / EP Format and is committed to the use of met@@ adata . a handful of camera performers is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime sometime .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata platform ; it is a label of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive up an original of your recording , mostly in the blank format , as it saves the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization based on fully compatible online met@@ adata , which support a large range of applications and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI occupational groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the dealer or the scanner . as long as the images on the cam@@ am@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing process , you can use external programs . if you return the pictures again with &amp; checking ; then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were under circumstances exp@@ elled from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact leaf@@ lets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos into &amp; publication ; in the section adding a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard disk , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to imports from your al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on display mode and turn it . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a skill indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ame will be displayed and a symbol for the file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera displayed . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the side effects and met@@ adata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information , which is stored internally by the camera . a symbol shows that the picture has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not have any information available . &quot;
&quot; the met@@ adata tab shows the internal met@@ adata like EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the picture . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page , from the main window of publication ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata may not be available for some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos to your computer is the click on the button download and then download the choice of All Download . this download the photos from their camera into one single album and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired using the default options of &amp; k@@ de ; select the photos selected , use the button Download and then download the selected download . the button exec@@ utable until you have selected some photos . &quot;
if your camera supported this is an option New download is available . these images have not been downloaded by &amp; publication ; in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the window display . if you choose this option you will of course have downloaded the new pictures .
&quot; if you can download the buttons All download or choose out , a dialogue with which you can select the target album , in which the photos are sorted out . the list of existing albums is displayed as regular folder , then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; publication ; download the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete them all at once by using the button Dele@@ te . if you just want to delete it , you must select it first and then delete or delete it . &quot;
&quot; note that there are no possibility of re@@ viewing the photos you deleted from the camera . so , you should not verify that the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so much faster , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras are used as fil@@ en@@ ame for the photos frequently not particularly expres@@ sive names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually deleted once again , after the photos from the camera would be deleted . therefore , it may be useful , the date and time in which the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirrors of the picture and for dat@@ ag@@ glomer@@ ate underground . if you use this last option , automatically a folder will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options for transmission will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the record . first , the data on the author is copied to the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to use a different file format as the standard format , you can for example in the editing field the pre@@ fix photo - % d % H : % S . place the option date &amp; time to add . for further modifications , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time reading . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you have the option to change the fil@@ en@@ ame in small letters . or if you prefer if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; checking came ; for a photo , is shown below the name that the camera will be displayed in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; publication ; can use all the information about orientation of camera for time @-@ point of recording , to make an automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras are ready . in the side@@ bar Met@@ adata page , you can read further details about the information that your camera embedded into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic rotation is usually switched , and if your camera does not supply this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic spin turn , use the button Exp@@ anded in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera is information about the date when the photo was made , can be available , &amp; publication ; this use to automatically download shelter in the target album . not all cameras with the same date are available in the same sub@@ album . not all cameras with the same date will be available to download which information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; publication ; the photos directly in the destination album . if you want to change this option . use the button @-@ based sub@@ al@@ ben on the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to their camera is the button download . then , select up@@ loading . the file sel@@ op@@ dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appear in which you can select the files to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection is done , asks &amp; publication ; you , where the images are to be loaded up . select here the desired folder and press OK to boot the upload . you will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude . the identification of the data can be displayed on the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to bar@@ gain an area through automatic inclusion of GPS data to carto@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ ers , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten it later , where exactly the photo was done , you can tap into a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; publication ; users want to loc@@ alize the location of the photo , it is good to get the position of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data sets , such as the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , via a post@@ processing of GPS data and image files using the K@@ IP@@ I module to geographic assignment ( manual ) and at least the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit , but there are a few that work with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a ticket module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye and A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can take place with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . however , these data will be saved in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module to geographic assignment . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and the GPS and cor@@ relate it . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the leng@@ th@@ - and lati@@ tu@@ dinal or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pr@@ elo@@ aded coordinates that are created for example by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com does not show any European road@@ maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; publication came to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; publication came ; to select to these settings , you need to set up in the menu settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
&quot; selecting the action can be displayed on an embedded preview or picture editing , so that the standard behavior of &amp; publication came out ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation and the copyright data . this data is automatically selected in the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . also , when downloading is selected from the camera cut . also , in a database synchron@@ isation , these data are written in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym of fibre : this field should be the professional designation of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations as a photographer photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , as this one is registered for a news agency like Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press . if the image is a warehouse , then the group or agency should be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ der@@ . this makes it possible that met@@ adata is permanently stored in the picture and not only available in the database of publication ; these met@@ adata may also be available from other programs and can be imported into &amp; checking ; imported without having lost .
&quot; images can be saved as an embedded description ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this syn@@ ced the comments that you can add to your photos , with the pictures embedded in the pictures , they are already written by the publication ; over@@ written by the publication . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window appears above a file . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; publication came ; supports a number of different formats and some video formats and audio formats . to determine which data types &amp; publication came ; view , you can add the file exp@@ and@@ ations of this list and remove . any file contained in one &amp; publication ; Alb@@ any folder , which has none of these extensions , will be ignored by &amp; publication ; &quot;
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh on the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ aire of publication came ; can be set on this page to the default values if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size you can use . if you have one , then you can get better awareness results . &quot;
&quot; by default , picture editing a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
Over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright colour in the picture . these colors will be defined here . in the picture editing this post@@ cards can be displayed with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 and be switched off .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the further explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG required a loss of free algorithm . the only effect is that the images are more time for initial and un@@ packing . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value on a high compression . it means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
with the option TI@@ FF files compressed can turn to the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sor for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is free .
&quot; with the attitude of loss @-@ free JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can reduce losses . even if you posted the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata were still not supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; publication , the image processing was only a image label for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . at this dialog , you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default offers is that all green pixels are equal . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option paints the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option paints the image a little soft , elimin@@ ates this problem with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the whit@@ ening of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white is not set off . standard is it a solid colour balance , which was photographed on a white map that is photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this option is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images can get more details in four steps more details in the top @-@ ways . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the top of the top , so the parts of your images are burned out , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to catch the top white , as they look at the top @-@ time white into the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the spi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; this is possible to re@@ construct as blue pixel generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; publication came ; and d@@ cra@@ w try to re@@ construct the missing green and red proportions from the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
put the L@@ umin@@ ant value according to your taste . you probably have to set it a little bit higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the publication ; image processing should keep you conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to convert a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered image sensor which provides lots of cameras and is known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction .
&quot; and checking came ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was created . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ b . however , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was of interesting when you search a quick fix with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue proo@@ fre@@ aders here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you run during the conversion . &quot;
a profile translated the color formations and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; publication ; information such as the color formations of a dy@@ e in the others are to be as accurate as possible .
behavior issues when a picture is opened in image processing / colour controller module with raw files .
&quot; color Pro@@ files Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can store all your profiles . &amp; publication ; investigate the folder then during Star@@ ts . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when opening the pipe file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color@@ fully not managed the entire screen .
&quot; input profiles should be made to the camera performers , and model you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently , there are some , such as Canon , which do not have any color @-@ like or Gam@@ ma@@ Surgery . this means that you have to perform the color @-@ in yourself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given by one device again . this is very useful before you print a smaller color section as your camera and some colors therefore can be highly satisfied , instead of relying on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious that colour profile provided for them for what is planned . unfortunately , there is a table of cameras and profiles that match together . this answer is obviously in@@ officially : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile lets the style to be recognized : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image processing . through the Deli@@ vering of this interface , you can support many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these are then loaded by &amp; checking ; these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short manual for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short command . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I @-@ modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ l@@ ates the time between the pictures , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other inter@@ cross@@ ings turn off the met@@ adata and / or , which are listed at the bottom of the images during the ad . &quot;
&quot; camera properties show on the left a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right side above there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . currently there are the portals , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage camera cameras . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / or , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your computer to put them in the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; publication came ; the camera automatically re@@ alizes ; if not , you can set cam@@ am@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you have set your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can choose any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert it here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving out &gt; images in the trash cans , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; checking ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections dele@@ tion of a photo and del@@ eting one album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar , tac@@ itly , can be used , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any feedback . otherwise , you will have to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the advertisement of the welcome screen of &amp; publication ; when starting , this was accelerated under circumstances the launch of &amp; publication ; &quot;
&quot; when looking for new photos , the base folder came to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the launch of &amp; publication ; if something from the base folder was deleted , ask &amp; publication ; you whether it should delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; to adapt the main window to your taste . these settings can be used under settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text@@ files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information about it in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correction and improvement . image processing may be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of preview and Edit menu . &quot;
image processing contains a set of tools to improve your pictures . some of them are available as modules in &amp; publication ; so you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in the section image processing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current data number , enlar@@ ging factor , and the current image size shows . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar at the top of the edge , including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently used functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you use the file saving or save the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should start a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving than perform .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can re @-@ establish the original image by using the File Re@@ manufacture or the button Res@@ p@@ ecting the button processing in tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have done at the photo since the last save . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting the manipulate , or restored by selecting editing from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for return and c@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift key to re @-@ establish . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the return or re @-@ manufacture button in tool@@ bar you press a moment longer , get a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between pictures in the same album or same key@@ word by using the navigation devices in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down , or use the entries in the menu file , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; scroll wheel , or the symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the menu bar . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in tool@@ bar : enlar@@ ging factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full @-@ screen mode shows the photo in full @-@ screen mode . normally , you can use the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can view this in the Settings dialog of &amp; publication ; you can view this from the publication ; main window view . see this section for setting the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the actual picture , you can print in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; button dialog . you can customize the settings before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture pages can be printed out of your selection . you only need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu album Export printer . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected pictures . the same side@@ bar is available , even if one of the five rider is clicked on : &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ like clicks on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear , or disappear again into the edges . &quot;
&quot; in the description view , you can enter or insert documents with unlimited size . note : the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . that means that all special characters are allowed in the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields to allow you to be used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only supports AS@@ C@@ II characters , and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and want to use special characters . if you want to use the IP@@ TC marking field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented on using the button , you can either use the button or simply switch to the next picture , the cap@@ tures are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or database . however , you can also use the met@@ adata to be written in the files . however , this is always selected if you have a met@@ adata attitude that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section valuation shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and Sor@@ ti@@ ces . it can be applied either with single mouse click on the 5 stars on the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut string . to evaluate multiple images at the same time . select it and use the context menu .
the rating will be written in the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the sampling view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the key@@ word and a selection with the previously mentioned in this &amp; publication ; -@@ session of the keywords . &quot;
the sampling tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the search term . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is a further relief in the input of keywords in a picture series . if you entered different keywords , it is stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the corresponding anch@@ oring fields in the tree . all words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main window and select a key@@ word in the word box , this only applies to the highlighted image and not to the whole range , If you want a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word section . &quot;
&quot; the side bar key@@ word filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , dat@@ or , sampling , and addic@@ tive views . if additionally one or more keywords will be used in the right @-@ hand side , only the intersection of these two are displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and disc@@ ard them . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main window to draw you with key@@ word . if the key@@ word exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put on to the selection . then a dialog , which you ask if you want to set the word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures of a calendar day . the key@@ word filter is selected based on no keywords , what the quantity has been reduced to three pictures . they were taken with C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a head@@ word was placed from the right point of key@@ word to the selection and then put a dialogue to whether this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes will take place at each start of the program . it can also be switched under settings different .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and discover that it would be one or less , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in control . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry according to which is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already in the database . &quot;
for example you can set a Exten@@ ded search for all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group the options , you only need the junction box at the end of the rule and then use the button group@@ ing . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly made it at &amp; publication ; s concrete implementation was adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color@@ work@@ flow work@@ flow is that the colors used by your camera or scanner come a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can reach that the colors on your monitor appear to those of your camera or scanner and publish the colors you want to print out of your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes to colour management , everyone wants to know what buttons , he has to press for the results that he wants . unfortunately , the sense of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient information about colour management . in addition , you will find links with deeper information to make your own informed choices to make you want the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; their only other image spending is by e @-@ mail or the Web , where s@@ R@@ GB of de facto standard . &quot;
so if s@@ R@@ GB works well and life for everyone is so easy - why one should then use a different colour base and thus have to worry about paint managers .
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ ms , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger farms to compare so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on information and then on Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to rot@@ ate my monitor ? if I decided to work on the s@@ R@@ GB farmer ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB farms or not , you need to work on your monitor , because s@@ R@@ GB works out that your ; on@@ itor is running on s@@ R@@ GB , then you must either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you try a further manual editing . &quot;
&quot; the features norm@@ alize , dis@@ same , automation , and contrast extend from the menu of correc@@ tive automation correction will automatically try out of your colors the best . you will be able to experiment with these effects , in order to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method will scale the leu@@ st@@ stronger properties over the entire image , making the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without its color gra@@ dations . this function is often a magic correction for pictures that are dark or washed out . &quot;
&quot; the same method j@@ us@@ l@@ ates the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so the H@@ isto@@ gram of Inten@@ sity range is as flat as possible . sometimes , nearly every brightness range produces the same number of pixels . it is a very powerful operation that can either be caused by a picture or it is destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic shut : this method maxim@@ izes the colour @-@ range in the red , green and blue @-@ channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and j@@ us@@ cated the red , green and blue channels on the entire h@@ isto@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; contrast , this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the maximum possible area and a re @-@ creation of all values in between . this is only visible in out@@ sour@@ ced images and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the whit@@ eboard used by &amp; publication ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ el@@ dy correction is a little limited because of a color level with 8 @-@ bit per color can occur . in case you can perform too far from the original image . if you do not work too far from the original image , which in 16 @-@ bit mode works , your ways of correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a whit@@ el@@ equ@@ ali@@ th@@ mus which is copyrighted by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it using the menu items white from the whit@@ eboard .
&quot; the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left side are both the original picture as well as the preview of the target image . if you want to see the original spelling again , then it is enough to click the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target photos has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ escence of Pix@@ els in this mark@@ er is shown as vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right side , a H@@ isto@@ gram is displayed that dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful , even in well illuminated pictures , most pixels would be very small L@@ umin@@ ant . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade alignment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also get down . &quot;
&quot; An@@ stat with the above controls run around , you should use the color @-@ temperature p@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the images to use the color @-@ temperature of the white @-@ comparison . in this way the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white comparison with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indic@@ ator raises the colors if more than a paint channel of Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the buttons Save as and store make exactly this . each setting of the white @-@ comparison which you have set can save you in a text file and re@@ charge it later .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; preference settings &quot; &quot; settings again uses its default values and the related neutral whit@@ ening of the white . note that the neutral settings may result in another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the codi@@ fication for each colour channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit enco@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding is also required for high @-@ quality images . this code is also required for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue as to the processing of raw materials . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correc@@ tions . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use it for multiple photos . this is useful when your camera or your scanner always need the same error . in the manual for the tape correction you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility of correc@@ ting problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; tool Far@@ ms effects provides you four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a cl@@ assy filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , solar alli@@ zation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that was created when you completed a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then the delicate , dark areas darker and the colors due to the second lighting were inver@@ ted . the result was a partial negative part of the image . this tool allows you to fine this very interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity control the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity displays the picture what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase will eventually produce a negative image that so not to generate phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of the solar power system . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by giving it a stronger contradiction , which makes the colors brilliant and gl@@ it@@ ating . try it simple , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the trademark name for one on natural daylight , made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . its name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth colors . Vel@@ o@@ as strongly saturated color are also some phot@@ ograph@@ s , especially those that little landscapes melt , too much . &quot;
&quot; the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates Ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome , and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ lich@@ é . in great pictures the filter may extend the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and illumin@@ ating your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button O@@ k and you are used .
if you make a photo with bad light rati@@ os you can get the revers@@ ed problem : one to great satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation . even in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can be reduced to you . if you like it , you can confirm the changes with o@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool engra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ aire / contrast / g@@ amma is the tool sound correc@@ tions for improving exposure . even though the dialog to this tool is very complicated , you need only the area of shooting . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intention , an H@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into the inside and the move can be changed to change the Inten@@ sity of the picture . the left side represents the dark and the right side of the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to post@@ p@@ one the regul@@ ator and to look at it as the picture changes .
&quot; on the right side , the original and the preview of the picture can be seen . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the picture , updates . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be set out whether the h@@ isto@@ gram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is often dominated by linear image . in pictures the large areas of a constant colour will contain the linear H@@ isto@@ gram by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark sounds , the average for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called Gam@@ macro values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ching can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the shade of the shade , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adju@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; extracts : the ga@@ des allow you to modify the selection of manual values for each section . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the ga@@ unt@@ ami@@ able such as in the input field . the compression of the ga@@ des can be used for example , while creating something else in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically , with this button , the values are automatically set in dependence on the intention of the image . &quot;
&quot; saving as and loading : with these buttons , the values in the file system can be saved and later loaded again . in addition , the Gimp format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically re@@ activated for all shade , resources and solar scene . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image for rotation , green , blue , and the L@@ umin@@ ant channels . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the input options applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the exit status are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original is displayed as and the target image is displayed dynam@@ ically in dependence on your settings . on the right hand , the following options are available : &quot;
modification channel : this selection box allows the channel to indicate the channel changes from the module :
&quot; besides this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures , the linear mode is the most sensual mode . for pictures with large areas of a constant colour , the linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a short @-@ cursor to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones are corresponding with dark exhau@@ sts and that will be the associated image pixel . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the range you want to change , a suitable line is shown on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and then move on and down to the value according to your taste . &quot;
save as well as loading : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve that you have created can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . the file format is the Gimp short format .
&quot; if you are creating this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ting buttons , automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and solar scene . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the check@@ points for the red , green , blue and L@@ umin@@ anz@@ kur@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . in case of more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the effect only displayed in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ator canal . shadow and solar scene was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; publication came ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the channel @-@ op@@ box you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first notice how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to their own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram will display the corresponding color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are on the right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to preserve the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then becomes the option Mon@@ och@@ rom as the channel mix@@ er then DAS tools to create magnificent black @-@ white conver@@ sions to your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a color occurs to a visible smo@@ ker which occurs from the color canal . color is made up of small smokers in each channel differently . if that is the case , you can improve your mono@@ chrome conversion in which you reduce the colo@@ uring first . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitrary setting allows you to save for later and then load it . the file format is the Gimp &apos;s channel bl@@ ender format .
&quot; the option of over@@ exposure indic@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that is , you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s not an effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a photo shown in the blue channel . the L@@ umin@@ escence is enabled . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / White @-@ photography has always been fascinating on account of your abstr@@ action capacity . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step , since color pictures simply can be converted to the machine . also , with a set of film roll@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky . thus , similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; Oran@@ filmed : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a orange lin@@ sen@@ filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air photos . thus , similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ filmed . &quot;
rotation : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates a dramatic ascension effect and can simul@@ ate moon li@@ ken@@ z@@ enen to the day @-@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure to a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore like the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces hot bright and medium tones while he adds a bit cold in the shell . this is typical for the photo of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ ep@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; publication ; tools apply you can apply decorative textures to an image .
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can look it like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu item &apos;s picture texture can be used for this . &quot;
Rel@@ ief : move this parameter to the right raises the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text enco@@ ding has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; publication ; tool setting can add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping an eye on the limits of a photo is not an easy task . a possibility to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to stream an eye . under picture frame the module can be started out of picture editing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you set the required cream type for your picture . in detail the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce converted it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white images ) , cras@@ hed it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is 1 % to 50 % limited .
&quot; this combined target image will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for the printing of the images , especially when you cut the tool according to aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text in a picture of any place . this also goes to several places where you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color size and the character set with its characteristics as you need . the larger the picture , the greater the character of the character . the larger the picture , the greater the image needs to be . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text may change until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the picture has been stored once , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; publication ; tool Sch@@ abl@@ one , you can specify a sten@@ cil via a picture . &quot;
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one can be used in the image processing in order to put sten@@ cils on a picture .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you must also use the P@@ NG file format and should add to maxim@@ ise compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to the reduction of the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you just want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the publication ; mailing list checking @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for first time , you need to put your scr@@ otum folder with the button base file in the dialog . select here the folder in which you copied the jack@@ ets file . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; once the root @-@ root folder has been set for the template , the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ ner is reflected . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ nails of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
you can preview three buttons with which you can change the enlar@@ ging factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button raises the displayed picture . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller size : this button res@@ ized the picture below : it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image according to the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to move the image below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
&quot; OK , if you want to apply the template on your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came , three different tools are available for grinding . each of you have advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool for sh@@ utter . it is very fast and simple , but creates , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ular images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact I can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es , and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , since he really improves the loop . it is a little more complicated in his application and has different parameters for adjustment . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ alized pictures need a correction of the loop . this is the case that the dig@@ itali@@ zation process can be summ@@ ed together with only minimal differences . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more in@@ toler@@ able than normal cameras for private users .
with JP@@ EG images a camera has often been applied to the camera . images in the white @-@ format must always be shar@@ pen@@ ed during processing .
&quot; some scanner is using a fre@@ er filter already during the reading of the picture . if you disable it , you get the control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by shar@@ pen a photo with the gr@@ in @-@ train balance . this allows you to call with the menu input procedure . &quot;
&quot; however , you should be careful about this since the results do not work very naturally : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of edges , but ampli@@ fying the noise . in general , the most useful technology to shar@@ pen one image is re@@ focused . below re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for wear . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to shar@@ pen . use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry cor@@ rigi@@ dity and experiment something with settings . the window display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ hed is a very good tool to remove V@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview of the image will help you edit . the preview display shows the version of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase in radius or view ampli@@ fy the effect . if you make the un@@ shar@@ pen mask strong , they will generate noise and impression of gr@@ ats in the proximity of sharp edges . &quot;
the radius sets a like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filters . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radio . they therefore should raise pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage of the original and the bl@@ ur@@ ring image to be added to the original . this makes the strength of the sharp@@ ness set .
&quot; the sul@@ try value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the use of the difference . one can thus define a minim@@ alist difference in order for a channel of filters . in this way , areas with a soft change between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore , beauty defect is avoided in faces , heavens and water surfaces . &quot;
this is an example of un@@ sharp mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a sul@@ try = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; tool re@@ focused is focused on an image due to the improvement of the loop . it used to use the copyrighted discharge filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool is trying to und@@ ulate a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focused class quot ; in which there is a better approach than just trying the photo . it uses a technique called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technology called F@@ IR Wiener Fil@@ tering . you can start using a technique called F@@ IR @-@ mask . you can start using it from the menu by using colours re@@ focused on image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular f@@ lange works far better than the Gau@@ ls &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ls &apos;@@ sche f@@ lar@@ ing has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result from the original pixel , which is far from the original pixel , which is far from distant pixels , which causes unwanted results . &quot;
circular loop : this is the radius of circular folded . it is the most important parameter for the use of this module . for most pictures the standard value should place good results . you can place a higher value when your image is bl@@ ur@@ red but then on hal@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module .
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 is rarely helpful . however , values higher than 0,@@ 1 is rarely helpful . if the smoke filter is too low , &amp; b ; 0 is the image quality very bad . a high value is added to the image even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ls &apos;@@ sche scar@@ fs : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ls &apos;@@ sche scar@@ fs . use this parameter when your bl@@ ur@@ redness Gau@@ ck is . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to increase in@@ compar@@ ably ar@@ te@@ facts . in most cases , you should avoid this value zero , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter . &quot;
&quot; size : this value determines the size of the trans@@ ference matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sh@@ ell@@ ate or the Gau@@ ck &apos;s cord . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the area of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any arbitrary parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then .
&quot; try all cutting , dy@@ e and Inten@@ sity codes on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes are not immediately visible , but leaving later unpleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you want to read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally producing more bl@@ ur@@ red Mas@@ k@@ ieren better results than scar@@ f . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than scar@@ ves .
&quot; theoretically , it has to be seen as bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king always ar@@ ming arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of in@@ shar@@ ps . for the Vienna filter you can indicate that it is the optimal linear filter . practical , the F@@ IR Vienna filter is often better in dealing with small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused image : &quot;
the original uncomfortable color picture has to be corrected . this picture was taken with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods of in@@ toxic@@ ating Surgery in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator j@@ t@@ te puts the in@@ shar@@ pen of the area of dark dark to create a natural more natural P@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; the color tin@@ ts allows a adapted color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want a blue eyes instead of dark , you can set this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove no desired ar@@ te@@ facts with an unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ settings as a starting points to simplify the restoration . the settings available are listed below :
&quot; if you want to edit the filter settings , you can use the &quot; &quot; smooth@@ ing and advanced settings &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; detail configuration p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ est over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should therefore obtain details that no scar@@ ves is necessary . please note that the details of detail should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; reefs Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ ed even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a high value of heavy patterns . JP@@ EG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value close to 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this puts the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . put this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is affecting larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to assess the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ letin , he must set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is going through . usually enough is enough for 1 or 2 .
&quot; Win@@ kel@@ p @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , there should be small angles a long run . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
integrated step @-@ wide &#91; 0,@@ 1 / 10 &#93; : integral loop range in pixel . you should bet the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 .
linear Inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you receive by choice of this option is only low . it doubles but the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow it to be allowed .
the buttons Save as and store make exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can be saved into a text file and later re @-@ loaded .
&quot; picture defect is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and a high CPU load after moving . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button drop . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how graphical errors are taken away with small ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is used on a photo that caused in Guatemala City with an an@@ alog@@ ous camera , that is caused by a bad footage during the journey ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; smoking in@@ duction is a very powerful tool to decrease ima@@ gery . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides a sel@@ ectable image filter available to remove spots and other arti@@ facts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor from the camera or fashion ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information on digital cameras from digital cameras , you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; the scre@@ enshot picture shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and high ISO sensitivity . it shows a bas@@ eline smo@@ ker , which can be successfully removed with this tool . &quot;
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub @-@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can remain with the default settings . &quot;
radius controls the window size from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and the image is moving over the image and the color in it is plug@@ ged and thus minor bugs .
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the filter . this value sets the pixel forward to determine the filter changes . if it is raised , the foam filter will change . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive Filter image is no longer preserved and smoking or lubric@@ ating again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controlled the edge @-@ precision for the har@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if he is too strong cannot be removed the whole smoking or smo@@ ke@@ wise , if you want to remove it at a value near the maximum , if you want to remove a watch@@ man or JP@@ EG arti@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controlled the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend that you change color or light @-@ density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controlled the colour effects of the picture . we recommend that you either change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process which is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; Gamma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the picture . this value can be used to raise the tolerance values of the dark areas , which are typically stronger , but it also lubric@@ ated the shadow . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the alignment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ p@@ adding . this value is defined as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius is re@@ acted to variations of the lumin@@ ance . when it is increased , the edges may appear too high . he can remove rob@@ bery and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges . it can remove smokers and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; store and store : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters used for in@@ duction , which you have set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and later charged . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how to change in@@ duction of your lives . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the in@@ duction was applied with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is too cr@@ ack@@ y for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than one image . use this tool for soft signs with the menu entry , inser@@ ting soft@@ ness and experiment with the smooth@@ est . the window display on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to decrease phot@@ ar@@ te@@ fak@@ te .
&quot; this filter to restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to show Gau@@ ls &apos;@@ arian noise , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sing and local error that occurs in digital , original or after@@ able digital images . the smooth@@ ing takes place along the image con@@ tours and therefore gets the content as it also makes human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm may be used for colour and textiles . the Tex@@ process is designed with another tool , the image error correction , performed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ado and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas it is not perfect , in some areas it generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts . - small standards that can be seen in un@@ zi@@ pped picture . this setting should be correct . &quot;
the buttons Save as and store make exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and later loaded again .
&quot; photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can last very long and a high CPU load after moving . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
below you can reduce as a photo with equ@@ ilater@@ al rob@@ bery . the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film is applied to an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie gra@@ ding on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old colour photo that has been read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo paper ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows Hot@@ pixel of photos that were loaded with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copyrighted by Martin Dick@@ stop . &quot;
&quot; bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are particularly high in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression to have a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hydr@@ ated quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ sub@@ tract method . currently there is no manual method to select the bad pixel . &quot;
download this file in the wizard with the &quot; dark picture . &quot; the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to view the dark picture directly in the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels by C@@ CD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the right dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and then automatically loads it in the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview can help you correct the result within the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels have been raised in all sections .
select an area to see the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ l these pixels . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ ing : it is determined an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels in the block . for an 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pix@@ el@@ block will be drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
Kub@@ ically : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction to a color photo , from a def@@ ective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image to correct . &quot;
&quot; vast@@ ly objective , in particular the medium and large photo format , often the entire sensor area can not be even@@ ly illuminated . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; instead , they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . Tele@@ objective will also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has disadvantages . many Center filters need one factor 1.5 or 2 in the Bl@@ en@@ den@@ filter that makes it impossible to hold the camera with the hand . vast@@ ly , objective , also with center filter , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise in@@ fi@@ ery effect caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the great exposure to today &apos;s film and dy@@ e or gra@@ dations of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using a fin@@ alisation filter that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ bility correction is applied with a C@@ enter@@ filter on an image . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker . &quot;
three Re@@ sli@@ ders allows you to control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fication filters and with three other exposure to the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light cutting edge at the point of the largest density . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , resulting in a optical filter with a aper@@ ture set of 1 , or random@@ ly to offset the density by a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re@@ vert the exposure to these options , as you only need to increase your settings as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re@@ construct the exposure of the target image , allow the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; publication ; image processing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lamp @-@ increased image was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the publication came ; lin@@ sen@@ li@@ ment is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . color@@ less distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ der treats the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ e.@@ Form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar circular effect , fla@@ p however at the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the remote corners opposite the second gra@@ des . if you combine these two can be eliminated any geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion nearly eliminated .
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion second gra@@ der . with negative values , ton@@ ical distor@@ tions can be corrected , and positive values of low @-@ shaped distor@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ des . this value affects the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &quot; corners &quot; has the opposite sign of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value will scale the image size and thus results in a correction first gra@@ dient . negative values enlarge while positive the image smaller .
brigh@@ tening the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used at the next start as default values . &quot;
the ton@@ ic or low @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all random or size changes . in the best way you perform this correction as all the first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then carry out a ton@@ ical correction would be the effect apparent .
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse button to fix the dot@@ ted lines in the picture . move it into an important place , such as the sea side or a building screen , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can fix the ton@@ ic / pil@@ low distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a pil@@ low distor@@ tion , the resulting image black corners will have . you can trans@@ cri@@ bed them using the cutting tool in the menu transforming out of the image processing or using the zoom re@@ gler of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the ton@@ ical correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs , such as pictures from the front , frame and paintings it is the perspective so to correct all the angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that when you keep the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of a ton@@ ical correction to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating the infrared movie of the G@@ imp@@ lic@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity area of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for the preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters set up the radi@@ ance and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO Re@@ gler alters the amount of cinem@@ atic texture and the dominance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; because the filter channels used to reproduce the infrared film , especially the green channel makes it no sense to apply the effect on black / white @-@ photos , since the color @-@ formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter applied to a Land@@ scape photo from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the top @-@ ways .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; filter film@@ making is an easy to use tool to reproduce footage on your images , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers large silver bas@@ kets of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film @-@ maker &apos;s effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere , or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ ined sight specifically in your mono@@ chro@@ ms photos , so you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of gra@@ ins are calibr@@ ated . the standard value is , although often higher values need to be set on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more Kör@@ ner , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of film production effects on a black / white image applied . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited ( 2 ) . the used film @-@ sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; publication came ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; filter oil painting , gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for great pictures . gl@@ ass@@ ures controlled the glasses or , from the other side , the arti@@ fici@@ ality . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the work is marked with the ( 2 ) . Pin@@ sel@@ size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and glasses 17 .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; filters coal @-@ drawing used colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a carbon sheet . the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ating you . this would be good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper controller chooses the foundation size and the sub@@ e j@@ us@@ ted the contrast ( j@@ t@@ te ) . &quot;
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adapting the intention value .
&quot; the &amp; publication came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , in order to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ ary landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filtering . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ tion effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave @-@ sticks 1 : spl@@ its the image into cells and it lets look like it is considered through glass blocks .
&quot; wave @-@ blocks 2 : analog to the wave @-@ blocks , the picture is dist@@ orts here with another version of glass blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of bl@@ ur@@ inary effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ erde lines that go from a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of often in the sport photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels to a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
dele@@ tion sharp@@ ness : bl@@ aming the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
soft @-@ sharp@@ ness Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image soft into the dark and strongly in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dream@@ y and gle@@ aming soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
sho@@ ok @-@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image due to random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a random camera .
smart Un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color bas@@ ins in the image and bl@@ ush it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : split the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the shelves are a nice little tool to make shelves to your image . this makes it natural to your pictures an appearance appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
&quot; trou@@ gh size , it allows the size of the drop @-@ size to change . since the dro@@ pping size is not automatically growing with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fishing changes the optical effect of drops on the picture . &quot;
&quot; you can use the &amp; publication ; picture editing a range free of shelves . use the tool to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you start the filter at the filter , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the cast iron . the original image ( 1 ) shows a peaceful sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example . &quot;
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can make it by mirrors or rotating into the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu transforming or transform@@ ers . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo on a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is simple . the big question is how can you keep an image infl@@ atable and the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information back ? how can you get the missing information back ? how can you get the missing information back ? how can you see the missing information back ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information again ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see the missing information here ? how can you see it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo is the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size change a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to res@@ sing the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try to infl@@ atable the tool . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are recorded in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; the aspect ratio is maintained : when this setting is enabled , when entering the new size the page ratio of the original image will be retained . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter is affecting larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is done , as it is difficult to assess the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s Tur@@ bul@@ letin , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons are saved as and store are used precisely for this . every single load for photo can enlarge as a text file , and later be loaded again . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load after moving . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
&quot; you can see an example of photo infl@@ atable , by adding a small color picture to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard Aug@@ mentation . &quot;
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not only a common operation , but also a commonly underestimated tool to put a picture . the image editing allows you to simply cut a picture with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pull the rec@@ tan@@ gle , create . you will then see this rec@@ tan@@ gle over as you move the mouse . &quot;
if you want to release the mouse over again the area of the photo will be cut off . this will change a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can drag the size of the right area by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cutting edge , use the button The cutting button of image processing in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the entries file to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the thumb@@ nails , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio which you have defined in dialogue will remain . &quot;
&quot; using aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in high @-@ format it is always assigned to the larger value of height and in the cross @-@ format of the width . &quot;
&quot; using aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use centimeters , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can e.g. see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to set the selection automatically horizontal or vertical .
&quot; below the dialog box you can use the max . ratio in the area to cut down to the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation orientation ( horizontal horizontal or vertical ) . if you are using the cutting @-@ tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cro@@ pped picture and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the inter@@ locking assistance will allow help to get your pictures better . these aids are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic divisions is based on the principle of similarity . like the third party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility of sharing a rec@@ tan@@ gle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
Golden Center : the golden middle is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the bl@@ unt blades of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the Golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and you were already used in the ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which therefore uses your temples and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artist and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 21 ,
the golden middle provides liquid aid lines if you put on a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you to your goal good results for your photos . compared to third dimension , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads the eye through the image along the line of the spiral and creates on this kind a symm@@ et@@ rical flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden square @-@ corner . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye can be in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this slightly can only be there without the eye , it will fulfil its purpose . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles also deri@@ ve from the above discussed golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the pages of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not equ@@ itable triangles . di@@ agon@@ als can be placed on these lines can be a static object dynam@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; when you use golden triangles to break your frame , create an effect of the professional photographers dynamic Sy@@ mm@@ et@@ rics . try to place your photo fo@@ cus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently . &quot;
the options horizont@@ ally reflect and flip @-@ mirror can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ic divisions .
with the button paint you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have an image with many colors and a high contrast the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to turn an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things turned around an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; checking ; image processing and tool free rotation . select the target angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are set in degrees . with the button preference settings you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are displayed on the right side .
&quot; for your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image to position the two lines . after you fixed it over an important point of the image . now , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now you adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you shot a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to fix it is the function transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot;
an elegant path to cut the picture is the auto @-@ cutting edge . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option makes the picture a bit after rotation . notice the above warning .
&quot; all per@@ spec@@ ulative transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle . &quot;
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle at the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective the image becomes a little worse . for an individual adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adapted the perspective , you get in@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to ber@@ some it is the picture with transform@@ ers cut out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the activation tool is used to shift a part of the image into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal switch will be distorted to the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part . with other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle will be turned into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can make this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
sc@@ rub@@ bing your image by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you push to preference , the angle is displayed at zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target will be displayed on the right from the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; for your assistance , a vertical and a horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the activation tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the che@@ ating , the image becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single lub@@ ri@@ cation , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots can be created twice as ex@@ or@@ ally and therefore should you avoid this . &quot;
after the p@@ adding the image has un@@ beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with trans@@ former cutting off the image processing .
&quot; and checking came ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write pictures . therefore , the formats available are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ iles to you . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all the available file formats available on their system , but they are always found JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; publication came ; displays only files in formats that knows . this happens through the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension has been listed in the list , you can edit this list of file exp@@ and@@ ations . in the configuration configuration , you can find more information about this . &quot;
virtually all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select the format to use . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; publication ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compres@@ sing data to digital images . these are redund@@ ant information to save in this way the image data to a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there is better , smo@@ other results than JP@@ EG in the same compression structure . the 200@@ 0s version may also be los@@ sy when it is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the pipe format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous , and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find rough pictures in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw material of R &amp; publication ; in the section configuration you can find further information about using modules with &amp; publication ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; publication came ; supports the store of rough pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is contained in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials supported by &amp; publication ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . however , these clips are often stored in Avi@@ g@@ or MPEG format ; however , there is no film processing program and will therefore have no one @-@ built alternative movies to display or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; publication ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings for playing movies to start playing the program . &quot;

&quot; if you exchange the steps 4 and 5 what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the white Module . &quot;
many tools you need the pictures in &amp; publication ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as jack@@ ets , soft signs , bl@@ ur@@ ped , bl@@ ur@@ red mask , re@@ focused , bl@@ ur@@ red mask , which shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress report shows the status of the filter on the current image . links from it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the thumb@@ nails . these modes are :
ver@@ tically divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected thumb@@ nails .
horizontal share without pressing . the upper range shows the original and the lower indicates the filter applied to the range below the selected thumb@@ nails .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right to the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper range shows the original and the lower to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) There are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colours used can be adjusted in the general setting page .
( 3 ) : selecting the preview of the preview . you can disc@@ ard this frame with the mouse within the image and on the part of the picture you want to see . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately .
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ tions from the last use of the module will be noted . &quot;
the side@@ bar properties indicates the essential information about the selected image and it is largely self @-@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photo . these data date from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive map tool available based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ van . you can press the mouse scroll in or out zo@@ oming . all pictures within this coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , you can check your images Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit colour pal@@ ettes and to select and use colours .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and har@@ med color . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed Pal@@ allets , or browse the folders to files . &quot;
cursor is displayed in the palm view as a line . it can be moved by che@@ ating on the area next to a color .
it displays the color next to it . the color is described under the palm view . here the color name can also be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor back . afterwards , move the mouse with pressing left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the junction box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written any other ; depending on whether the mode selected is selected . this mode can set you by selecting the crossing field below Bei@@ m cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions of copying , cut and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; &amp; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by a poin@@ ter sign , if another color is followed . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the range and output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; select a color somewhere on the screen , and then can be found in the h@@ acker on the left side . &quot;
&quot; &amp; graph@@ ene ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ite ; graph@@ ers are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in science , especially in computer science , so far there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs and programs which are used according to the program author &apos;s author &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graph@@ ene ; project has set itself the aim of replacing these programmes through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphic interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; graph@@ ene ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ ite ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; graph@@ ite ; displays graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; Grap@@ h re@@ calculated and represents in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the Grap@@ h in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack to portra@@ y more than this no@@ des )
&quot; additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graph@@ ene ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . in the beginning , when you start &amp; col@@ viewer ; without an argument , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the character . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; scroll ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressing &amp; old ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the file has just been changed in &amp; graph@@ ene ; loaded the file has been modified from another program the following window will be displayed :
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; graph@@ ene ; can make your decision later , so later , you can set up your decision later , you can set up the menu settings col@@ lar ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; col@@ viewer ; instance or to display the graph in a sub @-@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can permanently store your choice but also change it with the interior dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both save as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be chosen freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph are to be displayed on this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out of the particular parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages shared graphs without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page once again gives a possibility to set the behaviour when a file has been modified on the hard disk , &amp; b ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the possibility to set the behaviour of &amp; col@@ viewer ; to determine if a graph outside a current session is opened . you can open a standard behavior for that case ( or set the graph in a new window , or set in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site management page gives the possibility to determine the start @-@ behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) , or determine if they are asked for each start afterwards . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for specific graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or sk@@ ating depic@@ tions of directed graph . the algorithm defines the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few c@@ ame@@ ter@@ ings as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for perf@@ ected graphs . he produces portra@@ y@@ als according to the spring@@ board model . here the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm is used , the syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ cally multi@@ dimension@@ ing sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a jumping frame model . it uses the frustration @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics and includes a multi @-@ term rede@@ emer for the treatment of large and cl@@ clu@@ stered graphs .
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm per@@ ple@@ ted the k@@ not form below the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ ark@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams by multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell , and the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such layout commands , you can add &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ ite file can change special options , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graphs ( directed or ung@@ ed ) and uses the default algorithms for the respective type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ fied graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be shown if necessary . otherwise it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click with this mouse @-@ cursor on a &amp; GUI ; element to obtain additional help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og to the base file of the source archive .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewers ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ ite ; tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special institution is not necessary to use &amp; col@@ viewer ; in the menu settings you will find further options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol @-@ editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the le@@ list for character tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . afterwards a dialog , in which you can choose whether the icon will be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; represents the final step back again . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey stages . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the icon @-@ range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; doesn &apos;t change the symbol , but sets the current character colour to the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current promotions . from left to right , they will show you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current character area , the enlar@@ ging factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialogue with the three sides templates for symbols , background and tool@@ ti@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Dele@@ te you can change the templates for default File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixels or view lin@@ e@@ ale , and put you mono@@ chrome images : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency panel . you can also set the size : the car@@ os on Klein , means and wholesale , as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images to read provides tools available to read new pictures and get rid of them .
&quot; this module can be used to read and export new pictures from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as Video streams . so that this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you scan the menu item images , a dialogue will be displayed between all available sources on your computer . select here the source of which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the pre@@ determined default values to select your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you click with the button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
note that the window will be completely displayed as some settings are otherwise displayed .
&quot; after you have pushed the button sc@@ anned , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to adjust the options of the image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . here , you can also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the folder by using the image . &quot;
&quot; screen photos can be generated after you have selected in the menu impor@@ ters &gt; Screen photo ... selected , a window appears in which you can set the different display phot@@ om@@ o@@ di : &quot;
&quot; select The complete work@@ space to read , to read a single window under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when all your own program window will be selected , the open program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will have selected the complete work@@ space to read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete working surface , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop surfaces , you should select this delay too high enough to have the time to navigate . &quot;
&quot; after the scre@@ enshot was made , the dialog options of the target range with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; after successful registration , the module can send out photos to the Flickr website . you will be presented with the following page after a successful login . &quot;
&quot; just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed on Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will appear in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the module is launched to Flickr on the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog based on the current access per@@ missions . the module currently does not require any other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should add once again after you have placed all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Flickr Server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with one through comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the image as a tags during the high @-@ purpose .
&quot; with the options open , friends and Fam@@ illi@@ e you can set the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to adjust the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading are changed in size . size is taken out of the value of the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is modified so that the aspect ratio remains consistent .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery Export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; at present , the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery Export has currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata &apos;s met@@ adata , and geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ For@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographic loc@@ alizing Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call on the menu . to load a possible correlation about time and loc@@ alization , you must of course download a trace file with GP@@ X files , like the pictures of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation does the coordinates are recorded in red . GPS trace amounts are recorded in GMT . this is why the camera can be converted with GMT . this can be done by time zone . set here your camera zone .
&quot; the adjustment for the maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ per@@ ation . lies the devi@@ ation between them , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one location for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in min can be used if you do not have suitable data . if you know that in reality , a loc@@ ating difference between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . as the dialog automatically shows the coordinates of a call to the next one , you only need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the shown map and be found and set it . select the relevant region and enlarge it . the height must always be selected manually , and the map can always be changed manually . the map can switch between map mode , satellite images and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to hang on the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script to use the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery of HTML pages compliant with the version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums available as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set becomes UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ded to provide the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four hor@@ semen in which the settings can be customized . the rider selection allows you to select all the albums you choose . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically indicated . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly see a large number of albums . in the area below , you will quickly appear a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explained . the option For each image will create a page in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image , &amp; b ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be stored with all your related pictures . select a folder that contains the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ le Export , which contains everything it will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color @-@ depth . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are in@@ explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider &apos;s thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , these are small pictures to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore start the program to determine whether errors occurred during the generation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press Connect to enter the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I sculptor allows the Ih@@ n@@ ene to look at a selection of pictures and run on them basis operations such as la@@ vers , zo@@ oming or shifting . the spect@@ ator can be used with short notice and quick access to its functions . &quot;
after starting a picture is shown by default in full @-@ screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss is a tool to change images without imp@@ airing your quality .
&quot; this module permits , for which the actions listed below are to store images in JP@@ EG format , without the usual losses on quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the colour formations is held . this can be found e.g. in the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is a tool to enable you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
&quot; at present , the K@@ IP@@ I Module digital camera client is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the modular module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the import function , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata : the data will be copied to which you have pressed on the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not to write in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in the form of a gas@@ h@@ au .
&quot; the module MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages m@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base image . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition , you can choose the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
&quot; first , you must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . afterwards , you can start using ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
the images you select are then listed below image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sor@@ ting of images or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . if you plan to reproduce the file on a TV , you must select the appropriate TV standard PAL , Sec@@ am or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the one image is displayed . a low value creates very sudden , a high against it very smooth @-@ shift change . &quot;
the background colour can be set next . in doubt you should leave them black . you can specify the name and path of the created file under name of the MPEG @-@ output _ file .
&quot; if you specify an audio file under name of audio source file , then this is integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can easily get a coffee with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can quickly drink a coffee and enjoy the slides , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , so you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages over the button settings right down . &quot;
&quot; the print super@@ visor allows multiple images to print on a piece of paper in standard photo@@ sizes . this combined images can also be automatically opened with imaging Gimp . this is e.g. useful , to enhance you or print a direct expression using the Gimp module . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import and convert your images stored in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original description of Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w , that it produces the same results as the software from your camera performers . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in the mode for a single picture . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re @-@ optimize the values new to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the whit@@ e@@ els are to be used . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the image later . &quot;
a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera works in R@@ GB mode the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect .
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats , and the conversion ratio remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , maintains all the information of your image and uses the los@@ sy L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or use later otherwise , you should not choose the JP@@ EG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG as storage format , the met@@ adata that contain in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data . &quot;
&quot; if you have customized your settings , you can start the conversion button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can cancel it . &quot;
&quot; the stack mode mode allows you to convert various images to once . use this mode therefore , if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility to re@@ write the existing file . this is helpful in case this is not available in an earlier attempt . however , a preview of the progress has progres@@ sed as far as the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used for ren@@ aming all images of one album . you can use the pre@@ fix , the starting and tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
&quot; this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the picture smaller , or enlarge . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , chosen . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; pressure preparation : prepare the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge @-@ size and background colour , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . further images can be drawn to the list of images to be sen@@ sed and disc@@ ard there .
&quot; once you have started the module , the pictures will be displayed in the pictures selected by you . over the button images you can add more pictures . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of the images to be displayed .
&quot; with the button pictures , the selected pictures from the list of the images will be removed . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all pictures , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients using the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select are attached to an app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
please do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations to send to the size of your e @-@ mail . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and every@@ time until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you have to install the G@@ Mail@@ Agent on your computer before . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in an attached file , the comments are attached to the pictures into a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG Format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best to use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise , we recommend you to the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and the original files in the JP@@ EG format are , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the end @-@ to @-@ end images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down the status messages , in search of errors , can be seen automatically . your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end . with the button shooting , you can unlock this window ? &quot;
after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au you want to have a window with questions like you have shown your slides . you can choose among the pictures selected and all pictures of the album .
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation activate very elegant frames using OpenGL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , since otherwise the slides can be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option will show that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images in the lower left corner of the presentation will be shown .
&quot; the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end@@ release loop . you can then do it manually with Es@@ c , then ab@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; the option will be random accidentally , makes sure the images are shown in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album . &quot;
under delay between images there can be a temporary distance between the individual images . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should have au@@ st@@ ole before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly chooses to choose between the images a different effect .
&quot; during the slides , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; at the left side of the screen , you can see the current date name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; at present , the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module comprises the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE working . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can view on &amp; photo@@ album ; see through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , therefore , in person , places and in group keywords are present entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window view the categories , for which you entered the categories as you look at your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course see the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each case is described . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser is changing . see picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select another person only the images are displayed on which both persons are displayed . through this selection method , you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few single pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view with thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . however , for each person you can store their own thumb@@ nail , that applies naturally also to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined . see this image . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button , which you want to use on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords . ( if you have no suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide yourself which image for each individual person is to be displayed . now , you will need to open the image &apos;s image window ( in closer ) and select in the context menu item you can customize the enlar@@ ging factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the picture is displayed and displayed . &quot;
&quot; if you are entering the main window to search the entry , you will see a dialogue which is very similar to the dialogue for fixing the image properties very similar . this dialogue can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tures or descriptions of the images are asked for this text . if you want , you may also be a date to be searched for , i.e. in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the images according to specific name as you can see in the picture . here , according to pictures , on which Jes@@ per is not Anne Hel@@ ene pic@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the fast entry to the screen pictures and the introductory videos .
&quot; start &amp; photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , in case you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu using the menu entry on photo@@ album ; ther@@ eu@@ pon , some example images are loaded and you can test the functionality of &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as an associated HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; view the tool@@ bar . an image of this bar you see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar can show you several different periods of time . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you see a part of a database by showing the l@@ list only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar you can use on the following ways : you can edit the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image shows the current date in the preview display ) and also displays the current date of the current pictures displayed when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and drag the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ ings , draw you in the preview of only images of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides two options available to create HTML websites with your images . the one is integrated in &amp; photo@@ album ; integrated in &amp; photo@@ album ; built in the following part of the user guide ; integrated version that you can create via the menu file HTML ...
&quot; before HTML @-@ pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each section is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the surplus and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album ; html @-@ example page you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo@@ album file ; export file should be created on the overview page . nutritional information about exporting files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you may avoid that information is displayed on the viewer . for example , that all images are exported from a party . notice that you can &apos;t use any images from a party . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting in order to hide certain images from certain view@@ points . &quot;
&quot; in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most of the settings are clear , which is why not specifically received . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for the pictures . thus , those who have viewing your website and possess a monitor which supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images longer download the resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewers can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so he can search your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if he wants to see a picture larger , he will change to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folder and URL where your website will be stored . &quot;
&quot; preferably , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be automatically added to the storage location next time . you can select either a folder or a log @-@ backed protocol for all future images , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can verify whether these are really all visible for viewers . if you choose for the basic folder a URL will be started . the URL you should specify , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them to the final destination folder . thus , the import function , see , correctly , you need to specify the final aim of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are . &quot;
&quot; the currently described settings apply all three to basic folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to have a HTML page for viewing the images , location , etc . then you have to go on with &amp; photo@@ album ; this work will not even go once . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the images are imported with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or if the file can only be stored in the file . the advantage of all images can be stored in the file . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can select a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Ex@@ cep@@ ting ... or together with HTML @-@ pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in a double way . first , the pictures you search in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file are not found , so the images of the URL you are looking for when creating the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML Export layer . &quot;
&quot; the following is described in the dialog for the export of pictures , which can be accessed via the Export File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether internal or external .@@ k@@ im files should act . the following three options are available :
&quot; with the option Manual to copy the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically copied to the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , the images are automatically copied for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are regular Zip files . since most pictures already have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is normally not necessary to comp@@ ress the files compressed .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum limit size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to limit the images in full size , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . here you can limit the size by saying that each image is at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , &amp; photo@@ album ; exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for imports is made up of four steps . first , you have to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can person@@ alize the category persons of the imported file ( if you are a D@@ ining ) , while this category is in your database persons . therefore , you are asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and what categories are to be specified in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can specify the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse images and watch : if you look at pictures you can often see pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will pass the various steps from ( 1 ) to collect the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the per@@ sever@@ ance and look , through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ photo@@ album has been started as a program for managing your pictures . but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently also closes the video with one . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file at the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , such as standard backup tools , back on a disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they would like . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your images are stored and used for future Star@@ ts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; photo@@ album , so you can launch another folder album with pictures , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the option -@@ c . as example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; to set up the menu settings on photo@@ album ; set up into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user guide , you will be explained the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can view six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each attitude there is detailed help available , which you can access the F1 button and one click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; was described as you can specify for each picture different properties , e.g. individuals , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog , which is used to already edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section of sub @-@ categories , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog options , you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. all members of a group on once in a group instead of explaining all groups of a mid@@ day as explained in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings , you can choose to set up the membership groups . with the indicated selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . nour@@ ishment information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called upon the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this hand@@ book as they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , they are not part of &amp; photo@@ album ; however , most modules own a help @-@ page that you can call through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be shared among each other with each other , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; photo@@ album ; this is why you can always test new modules first with the demo database , before you call them on your own pictures , using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; copy \ &gt; or via the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , allowing it to be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also arrange K@@ IP@@ I , that the other applications does not support their pictures in albums : this type of order is not supported , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order according to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; yet simul@@ ates &amp; photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , i.e. all the images that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , &amp; photo@@ album needs to pass on a list of albums . on this page we go on photo@@ album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ album ; s browser shows the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have specified in the recruitment dialog as a category for virtual albums , so if you use the category people , will do so if you have chosen people to view and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; as some modules with &amp; photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove it from the list of modules . start setting dialog , and select in the area modules that should be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you will see an example of an entry screen , as soon as you can start your photo@@ album ; with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top one menu and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you see the window , with which you can browse your image database . at the moment you will find no information about your pictures . in the section we will see this window , so please click on the images to show you an overview with all the available images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the option to provide any picture with notes , which include information about the persons appearing on the picture etc . you can place every image separately or for a larger number of pictures given certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures Jesus pic@@ tured , and all pictures taken in Copenhagen have been recorded . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you may see these notes when you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see you three lists with a text box by placing people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; because you will always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is the shifting of the images inside the list : if you have a family celebration and in all 50 images are depicted on the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , so that the names used are moved upwards to find and assign each person quicker . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to have a alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting by date on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen comments on each image individually , you may want to edit all the pictures selected and add these pictures with notes . simply click on the pictures before and back buttons , which are under the preview of the image at the top . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. using the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all these images and to use the menu item multiple entries to once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ group . to indicate that it is an over@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the feature catalogue , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new Over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can simply drag an entry to a category and disc@@ ard there to sort out this to a sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just sort your category alphabe@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the clue by clicking on the le@@ list , which form the upper edge of the frame , click and move . you can make your own window from a frame also moving outside the window zone . &quot;
&quot; when you have adapted the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button Options ... to save the current construction and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also complete a frame , if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then window will see you in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected pictures , or all pictures in case you have no filter . one example can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply below pulling the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . just try it . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this displayed in the image will be displayed . if you do not have a window with a image viewing , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the images . simply select the appropriate pictures from which you want to delete , and press either the Dele@@ te button or select in the Edit menu . now the window will be shown that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; photo@@ album ; namely pictures also , without having stored on the hard disk . in the picture you can see the pictures somewhere stored , so &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required pictures can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures where the right upper left is cut , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; photo@@ album ; however you can view the thumb@@ nail of these images . however , you can not see these pictures with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this function you need to copy files from the folders and copy back into it . if you want to avoid trouble , such as the mess of your images , please purchase a larger hard disk to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub@@ menu with your name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you will see the images so that at the end of the remaining , you can also block all the images that you may see for others un@@ accessible and click on Cur@@ rent View All other than present view . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , you have defined which pictures in the case of the case are to be hidden . if you want to lock the laptop with your little sister , simply select the menu item that you have blocked out . if you want to get the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which must be entered into the lock of the pictures . to set up this password , simply select password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that this picture protection is by no means most secure . for one , all the images on the hard disk and for the other you can access the inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml file , which is not very familiar to the file named inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . this type of password protection serves only to those who have on &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar to have a look at private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to admin@@ ister all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and hours over hours for you to describe is of course that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album . this is why you can view from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator allows you to see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you enter into the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag them with your mouse and then disc@@ ard what information is displayed . all of these options are displayed according to a right @-@ clicking on the viewer . then the menu bar menu can be displayed below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here on the browser , see the appropriate entries to this display . so if you click to Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene would have chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can change between them and change the buttons picture high and picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ az@@ au . &amp; photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often there is a new image to press . start and cut the di@@ ash@@ au by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful skill of the be@@ holder of &amp; photo@@ album ; it is able to switch to full @-@ screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the entire place on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full @-@ screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can get into the image and remove them . with the minus button you can get back r@@ zo@@ oming The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how an zoom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the outcome of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the simultane@@ ity set the zo@@ oms , so each pixel corresponds on the screen to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations which function in videos work , that in and out zo@@ oming are with the plus and the most powerful . &quot;
&quot; with the script functions from the context menu , you can rot@@ ate the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item note from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it can happen to set a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the Canc@@ el and Con@@ figuration dialog of the picture to insert this name . but you might prefer to highlight the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures on a printer to see the pictures on paper . to see which photos do you want to start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you &apos;re looking at one by one .
&quot; for the two examples above gives you the chance to provide pictures with features , while you look at it . features are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by pressing the corresponding letters . in view a picture where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your images , these are available in the browser . so you can see all the images you want to edit , print or whatever you have chosen , so you can copy a module to copy the pictures selected on a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you view the categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail then you can press the features to the images by simply pressing the letters for the feature after the picture was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can und@@ o your gem@@ stone later . &quot;
in you can see a picture on the painted one . to switch off the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; please click on the picture painting from the context menu . simply put the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you must not control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; but the documentation of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you necessarily have read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties Properties and displayed the object in the wire mod@@ ell@@ y@@ als yellow . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ objects already have been selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to add a new object in the item tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select menu item in the menu inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible locations , the following split menu is built , so you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar below editing or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene beforehand . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply to these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can click on the input errors or throw the changes with cras@@ hing . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; you can enter the &quot; &quot; Pov@@ ray &quot; &quot; reference dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray . reference to the object shown with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation , to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 also contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in Fe@@ atur@@ ts view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in Fe@@ atur@@ ts View and a small example of the scene is set with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is imp@@ lic@@ itly , even if you want just one part of the texture you want ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
if a transformation is chosen will disappear the check@@ points and it will display a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifting . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the whole window .
&quot; each object has a visual level . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the superior object , or as an absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their Visi@@ bility - or equal in the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : has a window order , as default . the object tree , and the view of the properties tab are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you do not like the standard window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them to any number . you can also save multiple shut@@ ters and simply switch between different orders . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle will then show the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several opinions on each other , drag the beginning to a different view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the card &apos;s card and the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window order are pending views : views which are not ens@@ hr@@ ined in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the starting point to the desktop or click the small to the left shown arrow in the fibre bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the fibre bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
you can insert additional views on the main window . in the menu view you can find entries for each type of view@@ points . new views are sc@@ iss@@ ful that you can anchor them at any place .
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window order . it will be displayed , in which you can store the window order under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can use it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to ren@@ ders , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , it was written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ der@@ ship the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu view scene . &quot;
&quot; a R@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it determines the image size and quality of ren@@ ders . if you want a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures in the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender modes ... choose , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that can be recognized the characteristics of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the box size , you can enter the width and height of the integrated image . if you want just to ren@@ own a small area of the image , select the junction section and enter the picture @-@ section to ren@@ ders in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ field quality you can select the properties , which uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if an image is generated with just a beam each pixel , there can be different errors . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or incre@@ mental effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called Ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the influence of these errors . generally speaking pictures with this property is better .
&quot; when you turn anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam each pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive technique ; adap@@ tive because the second method is adap@@ tive ; recur@@ sive , because every pixel is always further divided and adap@@ tive because the reverse shot depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam depending on pixels . if you adjust the difference between the colours to the neighboring pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you adjust the Tie@@ to 4 additional points , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated , with a lowering value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated by : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , the pixels is set in 4 sub@@ pixel , which can be followed individually and can be checked on further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another option to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generating of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn J@@ it@@ tering , altered &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the beams um a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the diff@@ use Light@@ re@@ flexi@@ on calcul@@ ates . it takes a very long time to have a scene with this property . &quot;
on this card card you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
&quot; opening a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; when &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for this here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu item imports ... and select in dialogue window , select a file . &quot;
&quot; currently , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler is currently supported by &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not yet the complete instruction of error messages or warnings occur , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the item tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray ; this adds to the source code of the object in the opened text file in the editor , just select the source code in the editor and drag it into the item tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler , and in your editor you can also insert code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command will be called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene is used . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; click on Help in the Self View View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; guide documentation to the indicated object . place the path to your document and the version . supported the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example elevation fel@@ lows ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you do files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window type labels .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catching points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the buttons separately for shifting , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; bigger values result in a closer wire model and thus a better approach to the objects shown , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detailed stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High Page loyal to extended proj@@ ections , all dra@@ fting opinions are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . extended proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and proj@@ ections . this property gives a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time for renov@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; if you show a wall , a wall behind the objects is folded . the wall is presented in a chess brake pattern from two single @-@ adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you want to display soil , a floor is cut down under the objects . the floor is shown in a chess brake pattern from two single @-@ adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ ors , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more accurate details about the parameters you can find in section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and save window orders . &quot;
the Com@@ modi@@ feld Standard @-@ window order : displays all existing windows orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen window order to start the program .
the list of existing shut@@ ters displays all existing windows orders . a new arrangement allows you to create with the button Add and delete a selected alignment with the button removal .
&quot; each window order is identified by the name , the name must be clearly and must not be empty . &quot;
the list under the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can be deleted with the button Add and delete selected views with the button removal .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ plug@@ ging the window below the existing window , with box card and anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : installed and now you would like to follow all steps in this guide . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should make the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners , very popular : a bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should notice the following warnings carefully before you complain that you can obtain as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you will receive a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything error @-@ free , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so that you can expect an adequate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols right now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item editing . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera shows the whole scene which you generate . especially please note that in the fourth dra@@ ht@@ model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the perspective of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene .
&quot; the item tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you can find the contents of the view properties , in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the guide documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that the camera can change in the view control points , with which you can change the way@@ point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the input button , the wire model views and the object tree will immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could insert a squee@@ ze ( inser@@ ting body Qu@@ ader ) and size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a te@@ dious method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the item tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree , the new name will immediately be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view is also showing the plain , albeit at the moment only as a limited end@@ ental level . if you ren@@ der@@ ship the scene , the level increases to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re watching the item tree exactly , you will find that you can click on the icon + before the object . you see the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case you will find the different parameters of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : scal@@ p , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should shift the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select the shift and set the values as below : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor in order to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select at the moment something simple . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialogue will open in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . you can change the name in the Self @-@ View view ( name = soil pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only needs a matt black material because you can check settings for the pig@@ ment . therefore , remember the colors for the pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities now , but take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on Qu@@ ader and the ball in the preview , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you have your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color that you have expected . here are further settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called mono@@ chrome . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; select in the item tree every@@ time , and change the colors in the view of the properties tab : &quot;
&quot; you should already run this step , as you should have understood the fundamental working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the ball is just as easy as the floor to create : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget the box contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float over the ground as you have shifted the floor down a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the ren@@ ders results in now a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . put in the following step an appropriate material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already in the ground , give the ball a pig@@ ment as a color : &quot;
&quot; select First Inst@@ ance and change the name for example in the sphere of pig@@ ment . click on the pig@@ ment , select then then choose the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach interest@@ ingly , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following scre@@ enshot and click on applying or press the input button .
&quot; the settings she@@ en effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler has to offer . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts a scene , the ren@@ derer is hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that affect the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene , and how atmospheric effects affect light effects in the scene and how atmospheric effects will affect how for example fog . thus , the scene pixels is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will be able to see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you see the scene . without a source of light , you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , each scene needs to be changed , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
in normal file dialog you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler : &quot;
&quot; whenever you open a new model or create , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you must enter a name and storage space . &quot;
the scene has been re @-@ recorded in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be processed .
&quot; you can only select this menu , if you have not saved changes in the scene . &quot;
repeated the last revers@@ al command . this menu item you can only select when you have used editing .
&quot; stores the current window order , and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for hi@@ ring &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler with this option .
&quot; opening a dialog to set the tool@@ box . you can add and remove the tool@@ bar icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands , and remove them . &quot;
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ map is a way to pre @-@ fixing surfaces without changing any b@@ ump on the surface , without changing the geomet@@ ric form of the object itself . &quot;
&quot; it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for both a B@@ ump @-@ map as well as for a texture map . &quot;
basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to give them a realistic appearance .
&quot; a texture map is an option to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using a picture file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewing and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select pictures to display . &quot;
images can be displayed either in one &apos;s own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can see with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the return Return .
you can set whether each image is to be displayed in a separate window or whether all pictures should always use the same window .
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply tap the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if an appropriate file has been highlighted , you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two other , short manual for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser , the ke@@ ystro@@ kes can be specified for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures are opened in full @-@ screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color that you can further adjust below . default is not a full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this item is activated , loads &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; with the ending the name of the last opened folder . at the next start it opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full @-@ screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
&quot; you can be &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only some of the file types can be displayed , which can display the program . &quot;
&quot; with this option , for large images the display window will be extended to the full screen . this option is switched on as default . &quot;
determine if the slide show with the first image in the folder or with the selected picture is supposed to begin .
&quot; the time span between the picture change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default setting is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ ps . if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow is long until it is interrupted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or the small arrows on the right next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the box post@@ cards manual for the display window and short @-@ command for the browser .
&quot; with this option , turn off between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the file ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
shows big icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .

&quot; the show@@ cas@@ ing : try to give you so much control over his work@@ flows as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of the show@@ cas@@ ing . setting up your settings is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ or or over@@ exposure indic@@ ator should display the colors with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ exposed should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also see this page in which you can click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer makes images to scan and to scan .
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; a simple application to scan images that does not make more than images to scan and to scan . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can save for each image an dialog to Save and save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also save the images in front of the image . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by checking the necessary information on this search site : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ dat@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard sc@@ anners can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; with the command sc@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; set in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to choose the scanner is opened .
&quot; the user can select the scanner , click OK , press OK to open the scanner . &quot;
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can start a pre @-@ can start and then scan the scan for the final scan . the Vor@@ os@@ can start is started through the preview button . &quot;
to select the picture better the user can enter into the image and from the current selection of zo@@ oming . it can also set the zoom that the complete preview in the window will fit .
if the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; when you store a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a window display , as shown below , then the image will be saved and s@@ lie ? en leads to a break down and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; through the &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; settings the same dialogue will be opened from the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option is to be displayed on saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be deduc@@ ted . &quot;
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images can choose to store . dialogue to save for each image opens the dialog before any sc@@ anned image . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; this automatically returns with a generated name in a previously defined folder then you need to store saving without having a fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; this setting defines where images can be saved when the option is saved without having a fil@@ en@@ ame , then this folder will be used as default for dialogue to save . standard value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically storage images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to store . automatically stored image gets up@@ loaded , when a picture is saved . the string # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #
&quot; the user can customize the quality of the image quality . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the standard value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help will start the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button above starts the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; . the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used like all the other programs short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these p@@ ump@@ tions and their function . you can set up a list of these cuts in the player window and select Glob@@ als short@@ cut , clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short @-@ command . &quot;
you may need to set up existing multimedia keys that they function as a &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; make short notice . this makes your keyboard on the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP &apos;s interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions to be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP &apos;s functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . an example call for the D@@ COP &apos;s function might have pause , such as : &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k supports the Head@@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Am@@ aro@@ K has some own command @-@ lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user an alert when the script can not run out for missing dependence . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use dialog , so that the user ID is not running . &quot;
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / Templ@@ ates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts , or simply enhance the required features . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP can control your scripts with Am@@ aro@@ K and Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is to use the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be attached to every K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow you to run external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec ( ) can be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easy . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , the script should continuously monitor their default files and respond accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the interior dialog dialog . to store and load the furnishings data , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the working folder to the folder , where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ change sign@@ aled that a new piece is played on . the script might be further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the piece length ) .
volume e@@ Change new@@ volume signal a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ ary Cli@@ cked : sub@@ woo@@ it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le indicates the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu item you can use . to remove the menu d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script add@@ ler@@ men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) D@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; finished , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to work for example , e.g. storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script Administration may also install script packages that have downloaded the user &amp; eg ; from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar Archive ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be optional with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can recognize the archive clearly as the Am@@ aro@@ k script package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the Exten@@ ded amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right properly . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ Parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; if your script is ready , you can load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; attach the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; script should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; script . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps , you will also find a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you make the decision still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . in addition , many different audio systems can be used so you can listen to your music . Am@@ aro@@ K is smart , sexy and chic - just the right to re@@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter into the base @-@ level sub@@ folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ k : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report it to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; like most applications , some options available to enable or disable the configure script using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options must be certain dependen@@ cies , so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bu@@ ging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help with the development of &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without trouble across the interior dialog . the interior dialog has several card information for setting up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; player window will display the player window in addition to the playlist , or off . if the option is switched off , only the playlist window will be pointed out . &quot;
&quot; voting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . the option cuts the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; atmospheric design : this function is only available , if &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . this makes the paint scheme for voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; voting files at the music files put : this function is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . otherwise , the .@@ lon@@ files are stored in the settings folder of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ lon@@ c files in the settings folder of the appropriate music files are stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
&quot; external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will be started , when a browser is needed . &quot;
use other browser : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list below .
&quot; save the playlist that will save the current playlist automatically when installing &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option when you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist that will not lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the memory location of playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of music files is stored . &quot;
current piece of piece change visible when the play@@ lists are visible to hold the play@@ lists window - / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
&quot; with the piece change to the context @-@ browser , it automatically shows the context @-@ browser when the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in appearance , you can customize &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section , you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; set by flag@@ ging of own scripts . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player window and context browser . press ... , so you can select a font from the dialog dialog box . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom colour scheme , you yourself have the tor@@ ment of the choice and can specify your own color scheme . use the activated color selection for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; when entering the start , results from the start of the programme will automatically continue playing with the piece in place with which it has been stopped using the last step . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the OS@@ D . when on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the OS@@ D . the crossing field shadow means that the text in the OS@@ D is sh@@ aded . &quot;
own colors will give you the possibility to adjust the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . a click on the color @-@ areas opens the dialog for color selection . if own colors use non @-@ activated colors will use the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de ; colours used .
&quot; the text display text displays the text shown in the OS@@ D . through the input of space hal@@ tern , the OS@@ D can be customized to your needs . below you will find a list of space available and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . thus , you can specify on which screen a multi @-@ plug @-@ monitor environment is to be released . &quot;
the card card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers have further options in this box .
the card card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to add a folder to the collection , select the junction box next to his name . this section will also include crossing fields to setup , as should be used with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders in@@ appropriate : this means that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the cross@@ wise and their sub@@ folders will be search for music .
&quot; modifications monitor : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
play@@ lists import : results that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; all found play@@ lists in your collectors folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection will then appear later in the play@@ lists .
the part of the library database is used to choose a database for the collection . the Com@@ bin@@ feld driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected yet another facility is needed in the My@@ S@@ ql establishment .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql @-@ facility is used to set up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; it is used to enter the machine to which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered . then , under port : the network port is entered under which the database is at@@ tainable . name : is the database name , which the connection is established . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
&quot; the card load fl@@ atter . f@@ m direc@@ ts the support for loaded .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can provide the names of played pieces on a loaded .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece . &quot;
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your loaded .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the loaded .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send off pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your fl@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters will call : after activation of this setting will call &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters are reported to the each played piece . note : you do not need a load @-@ load profile to be able to use this feature .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for Unix @-@ systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
Am@@ aro@@ k only needs the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the programs included ) because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; require some of them to compile Z. B. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal .
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will support for example difficulties . we try to support Am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these places an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will bring an error in the Tag@@ us library . you can log out the file by clicking in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . after that , you can delete this error , delete the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and create the collection again . &quot;
&quot; mostly , this is because Tag@@ lib cras@@ hes in reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , just try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; am@@ aro@@ k ; is a bit of mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used libraries with the same compiler version . if for example &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this results in dra@@ ining the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then de@@ activate machines . disable , if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or do not use at least a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open for a crash ) , and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data can write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but this does not identify as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; NE@@ W _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; errors in writing the tags of $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the status bar ( random playlist ) / repeating / dynamic playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can click on the control centre under appearance symbols . notice that in some cases , you can click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ used symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ system Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map . this can be checked by ld@@ d &apos;@@ Al@@ amar@@ ok@@ app &apos;s _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation issues are easiest by using an expert on your Unix system or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k .
&quot; Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter a mistake there , if something is up to you in Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music get there ?
&quot; this is simple , use the file browser to the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup window was converted to the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are available for evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the rating column . click on the cover bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new evaluation column . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Am@@ aro@@ k in the background is also available .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press Ent@@ f on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your choice and then select from the folding menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist , and let them fall , just as you would do it with other files . that &apos;s simple : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , directly next to the Add @-@ button , can be stored in the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably you are missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . also look for li@@ b@@ ole , this package contains a lot of very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . furthermore you can find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! no ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be supported G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ins / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm . G@@ Stre@@ amer may even support text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in the default no MP3 decoder are supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ able reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 @-@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stro@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously release audio ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa .
&quot; the output of this command should help you in the search for the problem of mur@@ derer and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to provide another S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ sal ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; don &apos;t forget that media must be de@@ co@@ ded first . you can only hear a white smoke . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; also X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to Al@@ sa , just as x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer drivers ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open the Sound Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ servers with highest possible priority ( authenticity , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set to : &quot;
&quot; at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s , which can cause disturbed reproduction . read this error report . the magni@@ fying the sound pu@@ ff@@ ers in your Al@@ sa furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well . &quot;
&quot; either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia completely to receive the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ b.@@ as &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; you may probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less contracts are responding to visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; return . why ? &quot;
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all components . perform G@@ ST register to register all G@@ exten@@ sible components .
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg download , compile and install it . then proceed in the module folder of G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST register again . start now &amp; am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
please report below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. if you have a whole list of suggestions / wishes you send it to our mailing list : Am@@ aro@@ k @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . furthermore , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , this is already possible . place an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets go and start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; run before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken by the rolling notes of the music that you are stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can you find the current title in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ongoing title if one is on another computer ?
if a functioning SSH environment is present you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and titles of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user @-@ user @-@ player Play@@ ing
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username . this pres@@ upp@@ oses that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA is present .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; window . press to the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open up in an independent , in the size of modi@@ fiable windows . &quot;
the combination of str@@ g + rights mouse button represents a piece in the queue in queue . by pressing the input field after a search in the playlist the first search result will be played and the search returns .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but what about the icon in the control panel ? &quot;
&quot; click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers are to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS drive . after the start of Am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database cannot be created and on the console , many error messages appear . &quot;
&quot; the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; does not work with NFS . either , you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k to a local drive or use am@@ aro@@ K MySQL support . &quot;
&quot; insert the CD one , then click on the menu on audio CD . it will open a file browser with multiple folders . to read in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ domini@@ um window . for automatic enco@@ ding , take your files from the folder mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ates , the F@@ ROM Statisti@@ cs &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( ur@@ cap@@ e@@ String ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a split trans@@ cription in the play@@ lists . then select the evaluation of a piece , as all the other attributes also , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : review , select or catch F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in dialog Met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the developers don &apos;t want to present you when you want to publish a stable version of Am@@ aro@@ k . this means : K@@ DE packages have set up a fixed release plan which will not bring together with the short @-@ term plan of Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; this is a new function in Am@@ aro@@ K , which some users can easily find annoying , but de@@ activate the option icon while playing animated in the general settings . &quot;
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool to set up ... and take the desired changes there .

&quot; if you want to use Al@@ sa , please use the newest version . old al@@ sa versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and therefore also causes a lot of error reports . &quot;
presumably &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled before you have been installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore the / configure routine these output modules are not compiled . you must re @-@ configure and install Am@@ aro@@ k ; new configure and install .
&quot; now I have been installed &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; probably you are using a distribution , installed the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are installed . after that , you have to re@@ install the package g@@ stre@@ amer de@@ vel . then you have to re@@ compile and install the Am@@ aro@@ k ; again re @-@ compile and install . &quot;
I get the mistake G@@ stre@@ amer Cri@@ tical * * : factory for &apos; ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is incompatible with G@@ rel@@ ational compile . a tip from Merlin @-@ TC : configure no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
&quot; I consider the error message There &apos;s no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module g@@ stre@@ amer fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ stre@@ amer , next to g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must be installed . &quot;
you will receive the error There are no elements present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run as the system managed G@@ ST register . then you start am@@ aro@@ k new . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use Al@@ sa . how can I use Am@@ aro@@ k the second sound@@ card ?
under settings Am@@ aro@@ K set up ... audio output type the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an on@@ board AC@@ 97 @-@ Co@@ dec and a USB audio device :

&quot; the play@@ lists @-@ browser creates the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the lower part of the play@@ lists , includes the intelligent play@@ lists . these use &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s built @-@ in database to create some useful play@@ lists for running time automatically . smart play@@ lists are made of : &quot;
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played before .
&quot; even self fabri@@ cated play@@ lists are possible . click the Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new intelligence playlist . there , you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) , for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod , you must find the pieces on your iPod to Interpre@@ t sorted out in the top list of the media player Brow@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them on the list of interpre@@ tations . if you are finished , click App@@ ly . therefore , the pieces will be completed on your iPod . if the transfer is complete , you will end your iPod link to your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar you can find a search area , which you can search for a file . the search is particularly useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar , with which you can get music from a scre@@ ened URL . if you press for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz , you can enter the music in the file musi@@ k.@@ tar@@ .@@ gz . now you can drag the music from there into the playlist and drop . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the app@@ rais@@ al of files can be helpful in the window . in that case the holding of the Shift key can be helpful : this will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouth . &quot;
&quot; the playlist enh@@ ates all of you to play in the box . you can change the order by selecting the entries to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces are displayed . to reset the filter so long the back button , until the text@@ box again is empty . &quot;
&quot; if you enter separate search words by whit@@ esp@@ ace , will contain Am@@ aro@@ K ; after entries that contain all search terms , the search will find all entries , one , two and three contained . &quot;
&quot; if you enter between the search commands , the entries will be searched for one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that one or two or three contain ( or a combination of it ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain space characters , then enter the search term with ge@@ ese : Mike Old@@ field . thus , according to entries , the Mike Old@@ field will contain , not however , after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a certain search column , you can also search for larger or less . for example : review : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for mosquit@@ oes that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece , that does not contain a certain search term , make a minus sign from the search term : -@@ something looks for mosquit@@ oes that do not contain . &quot;
you can combine these synthesis variations by exposure to each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this search for all pieces that contain either Mike classic field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries , by pressing the str@@ g button down , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then receive a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces will be reproduced . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left side you can add the button Add , with which you can add playlist to the playlist . right next to you can save playlist , empty and random@@ ly mixing . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons are back and re @-@ establish . this allows you to re@@ vert or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar , there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refres@@ her rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the final button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more available buttons for tool@@ bar , for example ren@@ dition controls and loud@@ speakers . you can set the buttons set by clicking on the menu and set the tool@@ box ... select . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information to playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and playback is easy to change by clicking with the mouse twice in the relevant display area . &quot;
you can also drag the status bar . to disable the status of the status bar in the General Settings .
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking the playlist on the menu . through this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
a click on this entry opens the window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ in . there you can choose the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K .
behind this entry a sub @-@ menu with link@@ ups to this document and other information about &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
cover @-@ Administration is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start it by selecting the cover @-@ administration in the collection browser .
the cover @-@ administration contains a list of all albums in your collection . you can view all albums of an interpre@@ ter in your collection by selecting the interpre@@ ter on the left side .
&quot; with the menu view , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; queue management received your big immer@@ sion in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have put a piece in the queue , this number represents the order in which &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the pieces will play at first , 2 as a second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; the management of queu@@ es long will open you with ex@@ tras maintenance management . if you want to add the queue a piece , select the piece in the playlist , and then click + . you can also use the pieces to use the mouse or change the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre @-@ given ( the details for setting up these follow later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces during the playback .
adds pieces based on loaded .@@ f@@ m -@@ recommendations ( earlier : audi@@ os@@ cro@@ b@@ bler ) added . this mode requires that some pieces in your playlist are already required . you do not need load .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
&quot; click on the desired playlist , drag them into the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on you and then choose loading . in this way your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two compiled modes , random@@ ly mix and play@@ lists , fill out your playlist and you can start playback . the playlist Recommen@@ ded pieces starts with an empty playlist and you &apos;ll need to add at least one piece yourself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can be disabled again . &quot;
&quot; the button Neu fill the current playlist , and adds new pieces according to dynamic mode . playlist will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist you have the ability to click on editing . then , the dialog opens to the editing settings of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; click here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for coming pieces will be passed and will not be heard in this playlist , but if the setting is active , the already played pieces are taking attention to the hi@@ p@@ iel@@ ed pieces . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of played pieces that are kept at the beginning of the playlist . thus , you can easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added after each played piece to the playlist . if you adjust here more than 1 , the playlist will continuously grow , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right side has already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialogue , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you want to add multiple play@@ lists , will add new play@@ lists from each of the selected play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts allow your own settings . you can adjust the settings by pressing the script and then click on setup .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts , click on the script to install a script package to install a script package . after you have installed a new script on the Internet , you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . use the &quot; &quot; More &quot; &quot; scripts . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script longer , you can delete it . select the script then click on un@@ install script . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on the writing of your own script , please have a look at the writing scripts . &quot;
the dialog window Visu@@ alization plug @-@ ins is used for activ@@ ating the available visu@@ alizations in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; the window contains a list of all available plugins . to use a plug @-@ in to simply activate the junction box next to the name .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital audio ) . in the internet such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG preview is a completely open , patented and professional technology available for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG benefits benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dek@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG video decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers layers Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a far developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial ends . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss @-@ free audio compression and de@@ compression mode . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder and the external audio @-@ Encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack decoder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ code WMA files to burn it to an audio CD . &quot;
&quot; so@@ x : an auxiliary program , which can be between different audio formats - and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x Audio Encoder module . &quot;

&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a fully @-@ equipped authors system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analysis of video @-@ CDs and super @-@ video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . for example , for creating a mix CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections can be useful ; without norm@@ alize the different recording of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces can be reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it includes the necessary software to start from CD and can automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient method , recently opened projects to load again . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored once , the file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Dialog Save is displayed with which you can select folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would like to save for each individual project file saving .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project has been changed and not saved , asks &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after what has happened . you can then throw between save and modifications . besides , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any asked project to ask what has happened to it , just as if you were called for each project file closing . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each not stored project will be asked , what happened to it , as if you were called file closing . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select from the published dialog files for adding to the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you move the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialogue &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button of burning . the burning dialogue can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it makes use of a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you do not use files for multi @-@ session CD . it is useful for you to see if this feature is not used for you so that you can see the files existing in the medium already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry appears only with an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set up &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes not files from the medium , it only ends the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD @-@ copying dialog . this allows also without project file the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use only an image of a CD which you can then later burn later . you should also have to copy c@@ ubs if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows also without project file the copying of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only be able to burn an image of a DVD with the help of copying dialog . also , the target medium must be big enough to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire content or part of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the typ@@ o and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previous CD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then immediately be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , so you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously er@@ set DVD @-@ image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously illuminated DVD @-@ Video can be converted . this dialog window is usually used after reading a DVD in the view , but can also be all@@ ot@@ ted . it contains information about the full video , code settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the view view and contain properties of the medium , such as size and titles length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ makers of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enclosed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small trail is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ its the folder view , or out . the folder view covers an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media Info , locks and un@@ locking the medium . &quot;
unlock the view or out . the view allows to select and drag files into the projection view . the view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; divi@@ des the p@@ iste in the project view , or off . the copying list is a narro@@ wer area that contains only visible when the projection box has no real function , it looks just beautiful and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the key@@ boards for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the keyboard order below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; interior assistants . thus , the correct per@@ missions to burning CDs and DVDs are set . therefore , system managers are required , so you need to enter the password of the assistant the password for the System@@ Manager ( root ) . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here you can see general application opinions . almost all the functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on hi@@ th@@ eb . this dialogue is intended to person@@ alize and to replace the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; it &apos;s like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled for example via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so it &apos;s more useful to give your taste and nature of your tasks is crucial which of the accompanying programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; to use functions , you must previously make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; start . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; programs in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as my CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other features for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ CD@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ f cre@@ ate@@ .@@ DV@@ D@@ project ( ) Vo@@ id bu@@ o@@ C@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id bon@@ ded D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id mul@@ at@@ d@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ .@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ .@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ .@@ v@@ d@@ image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Cal@@ en@@ dar@@ i ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) .
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ f ( K@@ 3@@ b ) K@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then get a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and high @-@ performance K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; bird cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id Co@@ id ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ string Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id L@@ ent ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ id ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string ) Vo@@ id ( Q@@ string id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT p@@ co@@ p / home / tru@@ ce / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ readable for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the Encoder which is installed on the computer . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for the reading of &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers who are enco@@ ding ( comp@@ ress free compression ) standard ( these enco@@ ders need to be added from the Linux distribution ) . additional enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) are compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats such as los@@ sy @-@ free FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it must now be done . &quot;
&quot; for the second step ( for MP3 ) , you have to be installed ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ up ( for MP3 ) or other Ko@@ di@@ ers . however , all these programs are usually not necessary to compile something ourselves . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ version packages are not used , the installation is also not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / File @-@ Format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to co @-@ identification , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection features , it is not possible to handle any copying protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup needs to be done only once ( the interior dialog , however , can be called as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD ; this leads us ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you can frequently stum@@ ble in the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which codes are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; may &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can get from the Internet , or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the side step by step there are more information , such as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case must first be made connection to the internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the registration card settings in the interior catalog - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , allowing the choice to be read with another en@@ coder than the default . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured in the registration card settings in the interior dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already illuminated file for enco@@ ding is selected instead of performing a full &amp; CD . &quot;
opens the furniture dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , Pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main dialog dialog of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with various cart@@ els ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression rates and helps you choosing the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is supposed to go , a loss @-@ free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also others such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; which may be available for this distribution . the down@@ sides are the small compression rates and barely available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats you lose information through data compressed according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have an easy advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences are less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ans are very good audio @-@ quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame will nevertheless be free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions . &quot;
+ High to very high ton@@ quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at low @-@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , like standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB Stick , memory card , disk ) or special auto @-@ stere@@ otypes . today - in the beginning 2009 - these devices usually support the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ Pres@@ et Media &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = These setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . takes up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compres@@ sible rate about 5.5 . still needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rates approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music by young people , portable devices and Auto@@ stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this option will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or obtained through the program automatically from the free@@ DB via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / use with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of program additions for the Ko@@ di@@ ers and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame and the title must be added by l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ d { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button lab@@ eling in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which persons can read the audio CD , so that all other information can be downloaded in the machine , so that all other information you can download instead of yourself : &amp; CD ; titles , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( m . the writer is not a lawyer . however , nobody can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there &apos;s more or less worth@@ less so that neither the artist nor the music company cannot be added any more or less , so any information may be obtained at a bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is actively choosing a junction box ( Send an address ) . for the use of free@@ DB can be used with another ( counterf@@ eit ) address than those used in the system . in this kind of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address does not use the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use free@@ DB , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally on the next lying mirror is needed . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of reflections on the online call of &amp; CD ; information given during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which readable program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ours that is used to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed at first , if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the loaded , W@@ AV files can be chosen by the Ko@@ di@@ ers and thus the desired file format . in the first opening , you can pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of free compression for audio data ) on the tab to set the code . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the codi@@ le package must be installed by the specific Linux distribution , before the enco@@ ders can be used . this is also necessary for pre @-@ defined co@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
after installing a code you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a capac@@ itor window ( eg . console ) must be replaced with the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the decor of the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the spelling and reading of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , fla@@ x@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to give both programs with a command line in a terminal window . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the envelope of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is one chapter with one step for one step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual read it all understood , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , do not follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that will make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will launch the program for the first time , all set up and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . anyway , it is not necessary to compile source files , what you can do of course . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is and that you have scre@@ aming it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the Con@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic installation of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done once , and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which must be repeated for any release &amp; CD ; &quot;
&quot; here we determine the suitable codes for the compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program with you to use the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not be able to read a &amp; CD at any time , if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the reading program so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual equipment drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive exists , so a look to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card details General settings . here is not much to do . here , an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be shown / entered as scre@@ enshot is shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; only In case of un@@ complete information requests , so that you will be informed when data are missing from sampling ( tags ) . &quot;
the card holder CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a free@@ DB computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry begins immediately when you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they may be slightly modified with the database entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not work with free@@ DB locally . however , the two selection fields will be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following box card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is available for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data on request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server on the Internet . how does the system know which data is to be received ? read the section on free@@ DB . put it all the way it is shown in the scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we just want to work on the Internet server only . &quot;
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mir@@ r@@ ored server nearby . on this way the burden is distributed between the machines . however , this attitude will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both are equivalent to what the server affects , but there are many Fire@@ walls the protocol 88@@ 80 default , perhaps more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually open to surf the internet . &quot;
in this example we do not want to submit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . you can disable the first junction box .
simply take the settings from the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp on your computer exists )
&quot; number of simultaneously bur@@ sting pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time is more than one at the same time ? parallel reading and enco@@ ding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so easy to try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , please cross this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; a custom folder for temporary files : if you want to cross this folder , then the W@@ AV files can be specified if only space on a different drive is available . if the box is not available , the file will not be copied , if you want to do something with W@@ AV files yourself . &quot;
&quot; all to input it as it is on the scre@@ enshot . the command is slightly long , under certain circumstances something must be called to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , it is a setting for very good audio @-@ quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the production of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; day@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously to co@@ ding W@@ AV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to co@@ ding more than one W@@ AV file at the same time .
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as default for any reading of a &amp; CD ; used . if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section described how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described . we will create MP3 files . first , the folder structure , the way the music is described on the hard drive , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB will have to be described . the process of which is described in this section has to be repeated for any em@@ ber@@ ing &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet available in free@@ DB , the screen@@ caps do not see a little different from the data used for a &amp; CD ; with successfully from free@@ DB data . therefore , you will learn to manually transfer the &amp; CD . comments will point out to the differences . &quot;
try not the &amp; CD ; this example is to be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD has to be defined in the drive , which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length are listed in the window , as in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD has been completed successfully from the free@@ DB , all titles of the pieces are already filled out , and also the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database named &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; keys for your &amp; CD ; gives a window appears , and you can select the database entry , which your opinion is best suited to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the junction box for the automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this through choice of the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you have no local database , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD editor - input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot : the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist must no longer be entered into the input field &apos; Cur@@ eller &apos;s title , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the free@@ DB is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it &apos;s always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words start with big letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undes@@ irable remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters allowed for the comment area . if you allow ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . this option is allowed on the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the files created at any time with the day @-@ editor at any time . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by any Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers or file formats . see in the help of the Ko@@ di@@ ans to get more information .
&quot; simply select an entry , which obviously corresponds to the style of the Tit@@ le CD ; in this example , this is not important as we submit the &amp; CD ; data anyway . for more information go to the Internet page of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example are to be found under skir@@ t . &quot;
after the choice of &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will be back and you &apos;ll see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we &apos;ve collected for the first piece . simply type the entries for the fields of the current piece . give the title of the piece to each case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
&quot; it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and album are displayed on the piece list . &quot;
&quot; note that there are a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected , or select the button Select all pieces on the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection , so this window appears to confirm . click OK , and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider &apos;s orders for switching on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to control orders . the first piece is currently read on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left @-@ bottom part of the window in the status bar .
this error message you see if you are trying to work with a Ko@@ di@@ erer which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully co@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target folder are not what we entered here for example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folder for temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the co@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and code parallel . notice the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration setting to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes to read and enco@@ ding . the machine used with a AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous exc@@ esses and enco@@ ding ( of however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window appears . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today will chat within the &amp; k@@ de ; CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . however , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , you can install the pack@@ et media from your distribution . if you read this , you probably have done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs if it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . the best to read the step by step by step the options and settings . it shows pictures of different cart@@ els of settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading on ? even if only the help menu was clicked on after the first time start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program is no audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu . &quot;
what is about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this hand@@ book . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for who always wants to add something useful to or change it . at least , after contacting the author . and if you read this , he has to leave this section and is therefore agreed with this proposition . &quot;
&quot; strange when you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need this information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and caravan game of &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others it has with real @-@ time stat@@ fi@@ k and kar@@ aoke @-@ liz@@ ards of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player does not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ cular proj@@ ector , which is required for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with variable color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window to the cap can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( per@@ taining events or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; if you &amp; k@@ de , end during the end of a song , will begin the next time again with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ synthes@@ iz@@ ers , A@@ we , FM and CIS ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P drivers and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select opening ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and pressing the button subscription in the tool@@ bar , select the entry to@@ kens from the menu item or pressing the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts once you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window pull . ( with several pieces , they will be added to a collection and then played in succession . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regul@@ ator and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of Tem@@ po@@ ad and thus change the speed speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu pieces , therefore the reproduction while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; reproduction . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text box , others use lyrics and again others . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ist@@ type is automatically selected , which allows you to activate nothing manually . so if you want to adjust nothing manually in the menu settings , but you still have the option to change this if you want the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an E@@ ign@@ ity type , select from the menu settings the entries and per@@ missions . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summ@@ arise . these are played by the row . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to set a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find this in the menu collection under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click there in New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the list in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when ex@@ iting the application , this collection is not saved . concerns this if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the button adding a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the placement of the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece by opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and activated . this collection will then be added to the added pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played off . if you select The row after the sub@@ menu sequence of menus , the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove or random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to record a song , choose it in the collection manager , or use the selective list over the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump on a song , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to go back the reverse a song back , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece from the menu item or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map General @-@ MIDI @-@ events in events that understands the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that conver@@ ts all the events of the change patch patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the Change patch patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all audio cards are GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and CIS cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all necessary changes to the playing of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section that may appear as often as desired . but a prerequisite for this is , however , that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section begins ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as an email , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section is specified , as the patches of General MIDI to your specific key@@ boards will be displayed . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches in the right sequence exist ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ To M is used to place all sounds that supports this instrument on the sound with the number M ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which is similar to a gun powder . therefore , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( a gun ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum ) and plays the tone 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ed instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone is the pitch @-@ height of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how to appear on a particular channel or instrument .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section the sequence of lines is very important , as its presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can use multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to form sounds on the per@@ col@@ on channel . take a look at the key@@ maps for example .
&quot; this section can be used to switch some channels to another . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , make it easy in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the perc@@ ussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; here is the channel , which is depicted on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will of course use the name Name for this channel ! if you are using the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this canal . in this case , then patch is used as patch x . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example , in order to always use the per@@ tur@@ o patch on the channel @-@ screen channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o will be multiplied , in which relationship Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der @-@ events is calculated with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) will be re@@ charged with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) , so that the value 40@@ 96 is used to be included in the map file . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard interface is intended to play a pitch using 40@@ 96 , a tone higher . unfortunately , however , try some key@@ boards to play two tones up to an oc@@ tave higher . to check the right value on your keyboard , you need a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; to try . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under Settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ als view is a window with a whole range of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these cl@@ ots you see which sounds are just playing .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a selection list , where you can choose an instrument , lights up no more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view in the menu settings under the point Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that includes information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can not force anybody &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a comp@@ ress proportion of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have the control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have been compiled a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; for this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without A@@ we support you have to fix the problem you need to download and install an source of source ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files separately . &quot;
&quot; agreed to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . open the folder you want to add in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; previously , activate the setting of automation to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key on the left of Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; con@@ domini@@ um ; -@@ work@@ space a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or if I want to play a file ( if I want to change a kar@@ aoke file ) or play a file in the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; drag the file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you only want to listen to a file , without adding them equal to a collection , then turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ S. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ A.@@ B. First you just want to play the first file . so , select Autom@@ atic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join us to record B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have been sent to me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , continue to develop &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to collect some MIDI files , music making music and prove things . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ pil@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make a huge pleasure , if you send me a postcard from your dwelling place or a MID@@ I@@ - / Kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all who want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file ( if you want it ) . before you send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; complete in my spare time and put it in my spare time , and I would like to emphasize that I only want to write messages from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wai and Joseph H. stages - recti@@ fying the error that the ton@@ ic at A@@ we @-@ cards was too high .
&quot; my thanks also is Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the CIS support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the A@@ we support , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Christian Cor@@ des and everyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a supportive e @-@ mail . &quot;
and of course my thanks also to all of these excellent musicians on the web that give us this wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends much on your sound card . it is not the same as you use a FM device or an A@@ we card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you must compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ player , ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program will be used to play video files of M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to playback DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ ended ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please send the K@@ DE website to new versions or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . either there is the window with the central view . either , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that is only displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to get prefer@@ ential links under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that will be played by each other , so you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ies . if you click an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; updated piece &apos; , television and continuous playlist may also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , one can only do that if &amp; m@@ player ; not running through an editor , but also by the application itself . simply click on a name of a category , and select the next editing mode . by the cli@@ pping of a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be chosen from the menu and select either the processing mode , or select another category . &quot;
&quot; all changes will be lost if the processing mode will leave , or another group will be selected without having to remove the playlist . &quot;
&quot; owing to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can be switched on only by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during startup and finish can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available it can be simply inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files are ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . this would be annoying at the end of an animation , however , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; body@@ wear ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; ye@@ a ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . / sm@@ itten ; in the source pack / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f . are in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider to configure M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path of the M@@ player and the inter@@ storage size of the data stream from the network and other things are set . &quot;
&quot; another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here , the output of m@@ player can be seen . &quot;
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured through manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able , here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played : &quot;
&quot; Flash &quot; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; to reproduce the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module has to be specified as a service provider for the m@@ ime type 2 @-@ x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishings of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or k@@ m@@ player ; is in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console out of the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus always a pre @-@ given back@@ end for a certain m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this was also identified ) , this must be done by manual modify the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ man . for example , phon@@ on must reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be viewed , the scanner is used to use the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edi@@ ted manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( video data Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected ( e.g. , PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of play@@ able of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension has to function for the X server ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) must include the following functions :
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ T for the sources different names . at the time of the creation of this documentation , dv@@ d source , source source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ ature , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are enabled , they start playing with the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
are there indications like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is the user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is imperative to make sure / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine starts slowly , why does every time my CPU must be tested on their performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ .@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player needs automatically the last saved value , only the first time will x@@ ine check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user surfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ as ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are contained on the ki@@ le ; website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experiences with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or documentation is required , the contact should be made via the ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or if extensions , this should be addressed at the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; work area . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides the possibility to complete all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs in a graphical interface and within this one simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;

&quot; just like other outputs , contains &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction with which the general features such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text files are specified with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ &apos; { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ level assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is an important function for quick creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; it offers some possibilities for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : this is hereby the type of document confir@@ ming up : article ( article &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; paper &#93; , report &#91; DIN &#93; , Report &#91; DIN &#93; , Report &#91; DIN &#93; , slides &#91; Screen &#93; , slides &#91; PDF &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or Custom &apos;s . &quot;
code : this is used to set the character enco@@ ding . it should be used to use the character enco@@ ding of the system . modern systems use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 code as default . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ Doc@@ uments ) .
this list contains the most used auxiliary packages for &amp; l@@ atex ; for inclusion it only takes place in the junction box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) : the document@@ aries of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulatory requirements ) . you should always find use of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried anymore . only a short description of the functions and further information can be found in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; does - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; there is a simple problem looking for that some mathematical appearance will not be closed . however , you can save it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , it is saves you through the humble appearance of time and time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic adaptation of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) from &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically generated a blank page ( for input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the closure of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; set up the La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle item ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the struc@@ turing , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a mouse click on the screen . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex file . as soon as a DV@@ I ; file &#91; framed File ) &#93; , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information such as the font type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools in view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and colors . &quot;
when using the R@@ Ã ¼ I search the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor is pped up and once upon an element in the DV@@ I ; file text is attached to the corresponding address in the DV@@ I ; source code is attached to the corresponding location in the DV@@ I ; viewers .
&quot; Master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other integrated .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide Master @-@ document can be adjusted . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( unless there are any errors in the source code ) .
&quot; file date : in this mode , the DV@@ I ; file on Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ s. and it is not a call by &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after the rapid construction . &quot;
&quot; in consideration of editing tool@@ bar the three gro@@ om@@ ings of the document should be calculated in the document . the first selection range is for the quick setup of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The instrum@@ entation &amp; l@@ atex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the Fur@@ ther Show more is for the benefit of articles such as tags , fu@@ ther notes , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , image or different element is created . &quot;
cover : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection counts a selection field ) .
&quot; in turn out , a selective list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author works fine editing . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the author can also be written in &amp; ki@@ b@@ tex ; files can be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection field with the name Gra@@ il is used for setting the fonts , which can be defined for the main text , the size , etc . , the following fonts can be defined as follows : &quot;
with the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; there are two choices available : 1 . the assistant for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and fixed settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with your hand .
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ Pro class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , it can also happen in the text . &quot;
once the above @-@ mentioned code example has to be entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to achieve this is the use of the menu or the button .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage the storage is automatically extracted .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched for the errors . when using quick @-@ building should be started . if using quick @-@ speed should be started . if this is not the case , the log should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English ) is a text that is treated differently from the remaining document . for example , a report with the fonts will have created 12 and only a few sentences . the command \ \ &apos; { environment } , \ \ &apos; and \ \ end { Environment } . &quot;
the changes are only within the area ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no sign@@ age ( number ) for the possibility to be within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities for up@@ setting the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . it can be used for example certain fonts , fatty pressure , shelter , sub@@ missions , etc . that commands either by the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ \ { emp@@ h } : this command is for the cur@@ siveness and is long until he is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in one set may be shown with \ \ empirical { word } .
\ \ rate : created a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ &apos; { rate } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
&quot; following the background for writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; the pron@@ unciation language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the assistants a bit text was entered , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . there should be a quotation , a few positions in the fat and cur@@ siveness and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
once the document has been viewed can be returned to the editor using Editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l ( in internal viewer ) . with an external viewer the window must be closed .
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file has been created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try and fun . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is an important file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF @-@ conversion or computer screen . &quot;
for the printing of a &amp; DV@@ I ; file are the same steps as for the preparation of the document ( see ) . in the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I - this document can be printed by a file ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) .
&quot; tool tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DV@@ I ; file into other formats . as soon as the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion can be started by means of the kno@@ bs in tool@@ bar . &quot;
the preliminary announcement allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DV@@ I file .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides appropriate settings for all &amp; l@@ atex ; only modern under settings can be set up ... tools Bau@@ en can be removed . &quot;
&quot; in order to exp@@ ire the pres@@ et , the mouse @-@ cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source text and must be clicked on pre@@ conditions in the DV@@ I ; viewer takes place . &quot;
&quot; with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in the DV@@ I ; document the corresponding &amp; l@@ atex ; document of &amp; ki@@ le ; it must be specified and applied to the corresponding line . for this purpose , &amp; ki@@ l ; as a text editor will set up ( settings oc@@ ular ) . &quot;
&quot; should the use of Travel@@ ing the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers will not exist , an error can be made . if an error is available , this is displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log source file will replace the error source in the source code . in the editor , the log file can be used in the error . to view the error file , the log file must be clicked on the error in the log file and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template for the document . the options presented are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting a document , a document can be posted either from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; full users of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates in &amp; ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file required or a new file can be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and select a document template . create a new template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some character chains are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings Ki@@ le ... settings General . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which string chains of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically , they will be used as : \ \ document@@ ate &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { article } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and that means the commands of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way the following steps have been accomplished :
&quot; when creating a new document , the own presentation can be drawn instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , it should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described above . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be carried out in the menu tools directly out &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about K@@ ate &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibility to learn the manual should be used to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; you can start directly with reading the chapter with the Editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; command reference , which can be consul@@ ted with the help of La@@ Te@@ X @-@ reference . it contains an excellent description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use can be used as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with penetr@@ ated Str@@ g button , around the &amp; tex ; meaning that in this way is clicked on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; upon pulling the text with dr@@ unken left mouse button , the text is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , with dr@@ unken Shift key , parts of the source text can be removed in the editing window . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and to emphasize that . for example the &amp; l@@ atex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ ae are highlighted by another color .
&quot; many assistants can be added to the jumping tip clip . here , it is a separate type of book@@ marks inside the text . this is also highlighted the jumping stamp , so that it is automatically generated when the first input of a sign is automatically generated . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of turning a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; even though &amp; K@@ ate ; have already added excellent possibilities for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; important commands for their selection . below Edit selection , the following commands may contain the text selection : &quot;
&quot; if a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph there is not a text containing tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all the other lines of the source code . the only bo@@ wed thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the only bo@@ wed thing is separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; choose the word under the current curr@@ ing position . this selection also has an extended meaning , because this command can also be l@@ atex ; commands with a rating score ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; for sharing a part of the document may be removed from this first , and by dr@@ ing the button de @-@ f . K with which the whole row will be removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; provides with its own command for a faster result . below editing you are the following commands to contain the text : &quot;
&quot; removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description to manipulate texts . &quot;
it has already been pointed out that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore offers &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF further commands among editing environment for an ordinary and easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ;
this command will be j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to the setting of the environment .
&quot; this command will be j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) , the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the locker . &quot;
if the cursor is done before or within the command \ \ &apos; { environment } will be j@@ umped to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many wel@@ ded Environ@@ ments commands , this command can quickly be lost over time . this command is not least the recently opened environment , so that the bar@@ red environment structure is not visible . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; groups that are determined by br@@ aces { ... } be determined by brack@@ ets { ... } are a few important commands that correspond to the changing environment .
this command will be j@@ umped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed right in front of the sha@@ ky cl@@ amp .
this command will end up at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the call@@ back gear .
if the cursor is in front or behind the sli@@ pping cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is set at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering a lot of wel@@ ded groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly be lost over the moment . this command slept well , the most recently opened group , so that the wel@@ ded structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not included . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used for two simple use signs than cutting signs . for the purpose of creating it is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple use signs is used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and will be comprised of two coinci@@ den@@ ess marks for &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
this automatic entry of the double use sign can set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X and will be ex@@ ited .
you can also use gaps form ( for example n@@ german or French ) and with it German or French courses . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; when it comes from Shift key down from Shift key to Shift key . if the current position inside a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , not only a poin@@ ter of turn , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment , we slept &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an animated gi@@ ver break from . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ placed &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to support settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments , and thereby all E@@ t sign ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; tries to encourage this . while this t@@ ator is not related , the columns , for the columns , the columns of the current tab is added . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already having a good source code , it was added in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) even expanded . these modes work for different ways of working with settings Ki@@ le ... continue to be set . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ &apos; { environment } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { Sur@@ ely } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the entrance button , the last letter is removed from the entry and it goes without saying the complete list . on the other hand , the list can be shr@@ unk from entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions can be folded from &amp; ki@@ le ; alternatively , jumping marks too , so that a simple jump to these positions can be seen by means of editing jumping tip clip . &quot;
&quot; set up under settings ; set up ... ki@@ le ; you can set up settings for these lists . it can be used several ways of choice &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands , as well as che@@ et@@ ting of general language used . &quot;
&quot; the command mode is for the per@@ sever@@ ation of environments not n@@ asi@@ ly . it will always have a few letters with \ \ &apos; s and the appeal of the complete list with ambient mode are missing . on the other hand , the environments used so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of the environment . &quot;
&quot; when calling the ful@@ ler mode over the menu above , the command to complete the environment is automatically folded and it appears \ \ &apos; { . after that , ambient temperature can be continued in the easiest way and by adding the input button . &quot;
&quot; after this has been accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is frozen . &quot;
&quot; set up under settings ; set up ... ki@@ le ; you can use settings for these lists . this mode uses the we@@ ather@@ ing list of the default mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of covers , which are instantly set up by listing strings . as an example of a down@@ stream list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered and the word is introduced , the menu item str@@ aps + old car key , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; great W@@ Ã ¼ up@@ s are not helpful for automatic tracking , but it has been found that many wool in a document has been written more than once . thus , offers &amp; ki@@ le ; the ful@@ lest already written cri@@ cket . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ ful@@ ler . here , the swelling can also be specified for viewing the full version . &quot;
&quot; configuration files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / trunk / mode / the Persian home folder , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ up@@ loading ) , Dic@@ tionary . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphic works , designed for graphics as simple as possible . for example , the basics of the graphic works should be regulated and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for advertising and ren@@ ders of pages . the PDF output can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are newly arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to watch the result of work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the men@@ ding creation , creating converting and creating view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for spect@@ ator like &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the other conversion can be used the DV@@ I ; file in the default spect@@ ator by Alt ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file is converted into a PS file using the old ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command speed@@ building is normally called a spect@@ ator after comp@@ iling . should not be used as a spect@@ ator viewer , every time a new window will be displayed . &quot;

&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL : processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file being processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , then select the current file simply . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file using the other file file sel@@ ector . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is said to . the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; even may have little to do . this creates the plug @-@ in system very powerful . this creates the plug @-@ in system in a large number of &amp; GUI ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used further below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plugin or a K@@ Part , we start with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage all the included plug @-@ ins , and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it : &quot;
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location is used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; this path to seeking the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift key ; F@@ 7 project project characteristics are configured .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the nickname of the user and serves for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project such as both team@@ leader and sub@@ project leader .
&quot; the user can choose from the list of the team members , who he is . this happens when he is looking for the team member from the list , and the button is set as pressing . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ fier ) appears after which you are : text . &quot;
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important to news and notes . see for further information on remarks .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team , there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leader when something specific is happening . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific in the project will happen . an example would be able to record the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so that later a file may be saved , or a script that has a file being added to the CV@@ S as soon as it is added to the project , etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the event of events of the Shift . F@@ 7 Project Project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team@@ - or sub@@ project manager . see in Ex@@ we@@ i such guides will be established .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
notes is simple . it can be chosen either the note entry from the Editor @-@ context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word followed in a comment field followed by An@@ y text .
&quot; notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax of the nickname of the team name ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , the nickname of the one @-@ pointed nickname of the team leader , should be led to the corresponding departments or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and roller names are independent of large or lower , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; is a development environment for scripts and form@@ atting , the D@@ T@@ D diagnostic table is and web @-@ based form@@ atting , and scrip@@ ting languages . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only through &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others may be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by using the Qu@@ anta R@@ anta ... this dialog extends over some pages which will be treated in succession .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , with regard to tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / sh@@ ell@@ ings of tags : large / small par@@ aphr@@ ase of automatically displayed tags . normal wholesale / fl@@ ot@@ ings , the tags are as inserted as described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / minimum of attributes of attributes , size : large / small par@@ aphr@@ ase of automatically displayed attributes . normal wholesale / fl@@ ot@@ ings , the attributes are added as they are described in the days of XML . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : when requested , is optional for tags , for which the end tag is optional , this immediately after the bed . &quot;
not optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish line automatically update : when turned on , the corresponding day is changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic removal of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during inser@@ tion .
m@@ ime types : Mim@@ e@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . using the standard can be restored the default ones can be recovered .
standard Dia enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of re @-@ created or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the enco@@ ding of the file can be passed ) however . this attitude here is eliminated from the same in the Proj@@ ections if a project is loaded .
&quot; default D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . this attitude here is eliminated from the same in the Proj@@ ections , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; create regular backup copies , so that a power black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program can be recovered by this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . even for yet stored documents a backup is regularly created , according to the issued time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can either be displayed in the editing pane or an individual view ( or the documentation in a cardboard box ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings back at the next start is useful when the user interface has come through changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views by each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message gives the control of the possibility to switch the indication of warnings by checking account of no more questions .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; can change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the sync @-@ behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text display in the shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which represents the figure of the Par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document . &quot;
&quot; in the area of mouse @-@ click on the structural tree causes the following action it is possible , which can change by clicking the structure of the structure with the mouse @-@ hit action . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural nut settings the visibility of no@@ des can be automatically opened in the tree , the actu@@ alization of the tree during the editing and how deep during a change in the structure tree will be automatically opened , while empty groups are those that are not found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area on the forti@@ fications of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which can be un@@ folded when editing , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; which means , there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group is valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications of the third side , which can be re@@ used by every tile application , the most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; to insert a plug @-@ in must be the following : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be handed over to the plugin for the start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component mode load : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ esis @-@ K@@ parts refuse the store , if this option is not selected . &quot;
&quot; check the plugin : is this enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; whether the provided information is correct . if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; starting from version 3.3 , the Tro@@ ub@@ les@@ hooting was completely new . th@@ ief for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger was adjusted , as well as support for the db@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger @-@ Plugin was implemented , the various implement@@ ations has been made available via plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plug @-@ in is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin selection you can change the specific settings .
&quot; when a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
&quot; a view , in which all holder points , with character numbers and conditions are listed . usually appear in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appear in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything is available or part of the following functionality . &quot;
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , on debit requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which does not have to take care of a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not have to take care of it . &quot;
the equivalent to de@@ bu@@ gging session started the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or end the foli@@ age to meet requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server for a Deb@@ u@@ g request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to begin and to send information about the monitoring variables as well as the current specified line continuously . when this happens , the finish is continued . happens before a debit request is started , the script starts with the request . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to send without information about monitored variables and the current poin@@ ter number , when a script is done , the execution is going on . happens before a request is made , the execution begins once a request is placed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , without entering the functions or covers . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next statement in the script , whereby possible in functions and includes faul@@ ty . &quot;
points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the statement and go to the next one as if there were the current ones .
&quot; opens a dialogue , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the supervised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog a variable is entered or a new value of variable .

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; to suit your needs , and how you can help us , better . &quot;
document@@ type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; to give support for market and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ed ; skills such as car comple@@ ments and hub ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script folders and tool@@ box . day folders contain two file types , the same folder and tool@@ bar . day folders contain two fil@@ en@@ closures , the text files and instructions faster in a document than one user could ever have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; D @-@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ makers . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML Files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ an@@ alogue , the &amp; qu@@ antine ; file also contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; file tool allow a fast inser@@ ting of tags in a document without any danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; day @-@ folder are nothing but a folder . they contain only the &amp; D files . day folders carry the name of writing language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all is necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to make other users a better look and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is described in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can contain only once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type over himself otherwise nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument to function . ( only family 2 )
only for the tag@@ type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type Meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has an ordinary attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; Open tag . this is a mere element type element .
describe an attribute of a tags . this element can only happen once for every attribute . additionally it contains the name and type of attribute . additionally it contains further tags to describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; this is a just element type element .
gives the source material used for the attributes of the tag @-@ Edi@@ tor@@ dialog and in attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology . the arguments that can be passed to the method . can be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container tag that group@@ ed the elements of a list . it can occur for an attribute description only once . it is an only element type element .
sets the position of the attribute of one day within a dialogue . this day can occur for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the item is empty .
gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for every field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Day ) . this item is empty .
&quot; there is a list of elements that may occur within the same tags . this element is a mere element type . &quot;
specify a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a mere element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration must begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but watch out on &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text files to be replaced . this will not cause any leg drop , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools can start up in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; window to start and check the day of Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
this feature is currently not available . at the present time the check is carried out only at the loading of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; diagram &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
&quot; in the following an example of a functioning Family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; Name = &quot; &quot; ) ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; M@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly built &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; General &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nickname .

an action can set up actions with settings ... created . click on New action to the same dialog :
that this action has a short@@ cut short@@ cut . by clicking the user interface it can be assigned a short@@ cut ; with K@@ einer is the current keyboard short@@ cut .
the simplest actions . it can be entered into the detection settings and in execution of the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but on this it is not limited ) to modify the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) ; themselves are the quick start @-@ dialogue or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first of all the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . for example : S@@ H / home / my@@ sq@@ .@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ _ DE@@ HO@@ ME / scripts / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ Path There are other special variable that can be used in the command line : &quot;
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name .
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP are used to control &amp; qu@@ antine ; from the external script . &quot;
parameters for this event normally the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script entry can be received from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; at the default entry , can be determined what to send to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output can also be diver@@ ted . there are two types of issue , written to the default output , error messages , to the default error @-@ issue . it can be specified regarding the default output written by clicking the default output output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add actions and configure your settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . push the New action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add it to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day has attributes and you plan to use their use , enable dialogue &quot; &quot; Edit &quot; &quot; if available , so that a data entry is possible to address the action . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is that a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol , we replace it before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; note that the created icon does not only help you to realize what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day started , I decided to create a start kno@@ b as a symbol . through the use of green ( green is usually interpreted as a loose , star@@ te , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled , a message to the user sign@@ aled ; ready to insert in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must be associated with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; ) and select the desired action . besides the text field you will find a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the applying button and continue it with other tags , so there is no one or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; -@@ functions to tool@@ bar , or it should set them for better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ box to set dialog on settings tool@@ bar . make sure that the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to select the separ@@ ator ( totally to the left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , push the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick opportunity to have access to the Con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone , who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ ach of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; if new XML does not exist in the correct folder , it will be im@@ printed , but your tool@@ bar ( n ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( n ) if a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; maybe the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously add , to the normal user is the option to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language , or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ documentation for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; re@@ pository if someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we leave you , the second we treat you here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = path , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html = Part 1 , 1 = day 1 = day 1 = day 1 = day 2 . &quot;
&quot; the tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation is something : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element ( inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Start@@ ed = In@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ ver@@ duction = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ axi@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for chess notes ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the index directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently , at the upper end of the Bau@@ mans &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) . &quot;
spaces influence nothing but watch out on &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; resources are replaced .
&quot; the section of this section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file which is used for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( contex@@ tual List ) and the file connector . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of covers separate context @-@ elements that are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now , you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c just save to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc or $ K@@ DE@@
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ antine ; -@@ Re@@ pository for the use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; community . they will not be rich , but proud of having worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the cre@@ tory resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool @-@ makers with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at various places there will be an email menu items such as D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) via email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ates ; -@@ users can download them . the contributions are checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and usable for publication , which guarantees the source of resources , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their private GP@@ G keys ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple key , you can share one . in the dialogue new resource , the input fields will be left empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading must be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded from the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , machine tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , studied &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and signature . if the integrity given you and it may be dis@@ continued . if the integrity given and the resource is correct , a notification appears with the specification of the author of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages that is currently not generated by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files in the tag@@ XML format will be necessary . it gives the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D store and conversion of a D@@ T@@ D file . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
target directories : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defini@@ tions : the string that is released in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / EN htt@@ p / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; tuning the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion , when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; after the conversion the &amp; C@@ TE@@ P ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , there are some key concepts . in order to understand and take full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; we must first introduce these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , who is &amp; qu@@ antine ; uses , available . from tool@@ makers via promotions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this allows the group to secure different tool@@ makers , actions and patterns in a global tree , which will be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local elements represent a personal collection of web@@ development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ box . local elements are stored in the user directory , so that they can only use this user personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ ing with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most restricted size . all the elements are stored in the folder of project , making the sharing of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the Bau@@ mans , the Car@@ rier with info and the tool@@ box . please beat in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the cardboard box with the right mouse button to re@@ charge a context menu using the current , other or all cardboard , re@@ charging , delete or upload of the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the present document . &quot;
&quot; right in the Edi@@ tor@@ area lead to another context menu regarding the processed document contents , such as basic editing steps ( cutting / paste / paste / paste ) , editing of the cursor under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string is referred to as a mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the upper end of the Edi@@ tor &apos;s tool@@ box are the tool@@ box of the editors . at present , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard , for which a set of tool@@ makers are shown . in the course of further breakdown of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; they are adapted to new functions and associated users needs . &quot;
&quot; if they want to use tool@@ ing is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag that represents it ; now , click on the icon that represents the day . now , you can insert the data for that straight ( as anchor ) , then you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow to navigate the information to &amp; qu@@ antine ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the representation of cardboard boxes are available for files , project , templates , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously . this view displays all files in the project and allows the administr@@ ations of the files in the project by far right mouse click . promotions such as adding , removing , upload , or delete files from memory disc , can then be carried out with the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; the use of templates . almost everything can be a template . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be classified in three categories depending on what connection they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; work@@ ings are always available , local templates only for the appropriate users and templates in projects are only available in the project . more about templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of outsourcing in Global , local and project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can call the available information to a script . over the right mouse button , you can boot the script to edit or send an email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ clicking of an element , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of an element , a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree will open . &quot;
&quot; this tree will appear under the other parts of the construction . with it , some can change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . this allows modification of all available attributes with a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . there can be pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc into a project can be edited and considered project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , two cart@@ on at the bottom of the window , can be accessed through the beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this cardboard box shows information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . thus , for example , the D@@ T@@ D of the current document and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this box shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there is ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ates ; tool@@ box are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the appropriate command displayed . the Cho@@ colate side of the tool@@ box is the possibility of defining their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; to define . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with an email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; sends the tool@@ bar to be compressed @-@ archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure it in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; as any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; files on your system will be able to specify a complete list of options that can be passed to the configure script . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not run here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you should verify whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path prior to her bin folder . the same is true for &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML , the developers started to create , the developer of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; a peculiar , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up @-@ language editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web @-@ development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ed ; now it is already on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . together , if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then the appropriate &amp; IDE should be . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be recorded that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; as a product is based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; development community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; follows , in a good application of free software , the idea of Why developed it ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ ours is not just this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to expand as they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; allows web@@ developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by the program comm@@ a , they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web design , and quickly developed into a mature editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more in detail documentation is available with help : / qu@@ anta ( either to enter this URL in &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help@@ desk help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; it is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ix sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes each time , if you open a file which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project pre@@ deposit box , only a mistake is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there , special characters to &amp; HTML , so that it is correctly displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions . &quot;
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; template that is the correct way to inser@@ ting special signs and space characters in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to Past@@ ing &amp; URL ; s are used in the anchor day .
&quot; tick the block@@ sel@@ ector to or from . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key ; key . &quot;
goes directly to a poin@@ ter number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages are available !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
shows the message window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of the problem @-@ lab@@ our@@ er at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , main window . the problem @-@ re@@ porter will be activated once you change to a structural tree . &quot;
shows the tool@@ bar left from the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; when book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries previous or next , depending on the position of the ho@@ urs@@ ors in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; projects are saved with the file sending .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
&quot; presents a dialog to include files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory . &quot;
&quot; searches the project directory according to new files that could be there . this allows to copy , e.g. video files into your project folder or sub@@ folders and then add it to the project . &quot;
download the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have any further input / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; settings , such as qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; projects can be explained the details . &quot;
&quot; loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu , if you have assigned them to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialogue to save your tool@@ box . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions will have to save via tool@@ making tool , or you will be asked with what they want to save the tool@@ box . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not del@@ etes them from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; with this you can send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; team , so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ makers on the main server , where any other access is able to access . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; who made you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; qu@@ int@@ essence ; their own description format .
&quot; loading / refresh the en@@ ties of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it is useful when the ti@@ ties from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; to renew itself . if this is global and a ty@@ ken are not present in the global K@@ DE folder , it fails to load the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags that are available in the currently charged tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML , ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there are the tags menu a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag dialog , if there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; enabled or disabled the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that , inser@@ ting using tool@@ bar , if this day goes against the rules to this place . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ ins menu , the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on . press a activated plug @-@ ins disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syn@@ ergy mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; select the type of poin@@ ter capture . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to the developer . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; via external application .
&quot; instant switch between the different types of interface . through some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries can sometimes cause time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended , the card setting , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display at &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu for each open window window contains an entry . with selection of a single window , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
&quot; switch the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , main window , respectively . &quot;
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application , using the K@@ HTML Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
focuses on the behavior of the editor . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialogue appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which can add and change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; what is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and free licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ antine ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from above to below , for example after filling the entire directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted with Shift key for the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &quot; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul &quot; project . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory . &quot;
&quot; here is the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , one , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exemp@@ li@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol may be used . depending on the adjustment of the remote computer , an adjustment could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path leading to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where the tool@@ box can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; that allows , files from the local file system to add to the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder . &quot;
&quot; this setting is great if you have st@@ atic web content , which you want to download and change . with ser@@ vers@@ ed script ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main @-@ level sub@@ folder of the project , if a project is emerging from scratch , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make an exact choice after entertainment . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by clicking or , by removing the tick , sp@@ amm@@ ing out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assistant contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the window window sheet or with the short@@ cut Shift key ; F@@ 7 are changed .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( space holder is possible ) , which are newly ignored by project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the projection of the project , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about proj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger is selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set with the Options . in addition , the de@@ bu@@ gger is described . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window profiles up@@ loading high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a site view for the contents of the server for each profile , by drawing up their own construction site for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window event you can turn event actions and add these actions , modify or delete these actions . event actions will be executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ oth@@ es of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously opens ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior cannot be influenced by now . &quot;
&quot; to open a different project , choose project opening ... from the menu Project or the icon project open out of tool@@ bar . the dialogue project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , however the entries are open and open with ... in the right mouse button on the right @-@ button menu : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files , see . &quot;
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is cut to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password is kept in the core memory and forget it . this possibility is useful when most common up@@ loading files needed is needed and the rather uns@@ afe password on the record does not store this option .
this will stop transmission or simply leave dialogue if you want to change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , many high @-@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile will be shown this dialog : &quot;
&quot; that is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or IP address function . &quot;
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( locally ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed unless network administrator runs a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety shaft , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the record , so that it can not be read easy , but anyone with programming can be easily seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is just a set of files and tool@@ making . it can give in a project many views , that is , by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ box can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ box . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored or stored in the menu Project or Project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ box project tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; to the own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ makers in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; best to use the menu tool@@ bar , using and add tool@@ ing . adding tool@@ makers will be treated down in the section Add tool@@ box . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ box and the icons can be set using either context menu ( right @-@ clicking on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action tool@@ bar can be set , tool@@ bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog , where can be specified on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , you will additionally remove the entries action and edited action , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ makers and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool@@ makers ... and set up actions .. set .
&quot; templates are in key document skel@@ eton , code cuts and files for link@@ age . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ing ; used templates basically like a nasty file system with exten@@ sible organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or each one on the system to link the existing directory in the pre @-@ tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; in about the restrictions that you imagine for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ Saul ; delivered templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template , prior to using precisely . &quot;
&quot; it can be inserted in documents except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc ; binary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the sub@@ du@@ ous tree under global templates . further information about the Templ@@ ates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be created by any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally you will find simple rum@@ ors for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree .
&quot; this kind of templates is useful when not a new document based on a template , but the same text area is to be inserted again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final tree under global templates . see in for more information about templates tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , serve these templates for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a zi@@ ped tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure after expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and select File As a template save as a local template . ... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , please note that ( even if it was saved as a project run ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the pre@@ fix tree under project templates . &quot;
select text in your document and click File to save as a template store as a local / project process . alternatively the selection can be easily pulled with pulling and drop on the construction supervision templates .
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied into a pre @-@ deposit folder . it can be used all file managers , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in the file tree , or in the project files , you can click on a folder on the right and secure site template , secured a name for the template and secure . by default it is stored in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow for a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can create head@@ lines and foot@@ lines , or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; creating files , insert files or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things in dealing with templates in projects very deep . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ structure structure in the sub @-@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / network / apps / li@@ anta / templates / templates / network / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates / templates /
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder in the pre @-@ view , click on the folder and select in the context menu tab . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is diver@@ ted as soon as el@@ ong@@ ated attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular sub@@ folders in the pre @-@ view . if a stem folder would fundamentally dis@@ abling , unless they would be explicitly active in this path , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a regular sub@@ folder . &quot;
allowed for a specific project by submitting the text messages to templates in this folder . this could be general Head@@ lines and foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows to equi@@ p all the presentations with special head@@ lines / foot@@ lines a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ lines .
&quot; in addition , you have a text menu ( show right mouse button ) on a complete instruction collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ane@@ ously ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that are accessible via the menu View Editor . the first mode replaces the Editor window in two parts : the source code and the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - page and a cursor . then you can edit the source code in which the modifications made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , which contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ editor . there is no plans to modify this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first one , except that at the same time the changes both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor visible , this mode is already active , puts the active cursor from one window to another , whereby the position in the document is maintained . &quot;
the sync distance between V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source text editor is adjustable to settings Qu@@ anta . in mind you can choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . basically the recommendation is required : a small span@@ iel for fast computer and a large span@@ iel for slow .
&quot; it is assumed that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of the invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; the editor will also be used : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click into the list allows modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key wor@@ t@@ 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design your vision of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change of the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style procedure by pressing to the file @-@ open button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , possible by filling with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and er@@ ase or dele@@ ne@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ box , as in the source text editor . it is to note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other must be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ box such as the tables @-@ wizard or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . later , you will be able to work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ box must be used . &quot;
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of Stil@@ ts . unlike other programs for Stil@@ ts the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of style can be pro@@ secuted .
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successful compile , need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ als , li@@ bex@@ s@@ als and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de . &quot;

&quot; on systems with install Re@@ ad@@ line library , you can handle the arrow buttons on / from the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the commands so far . &quot;
&quot; multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to put together expressions as an argument . &amp; eg : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; &quot; as an argument , a holder point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BAR _ @ quot ; &quot; . &quot; &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the AS@@ C@@ II characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a completely qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ pl@@ ate@@ name . &quot;

&quot; there are many graphical tools for comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly , why I have written . &quot;
&quot; the merger was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected , a further programmer had changed a lot of text at the same time . a further programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result had numerous conflicts . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the re@@ turn@@ out was changed . this changes had been a small nightmare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 were able to display differences within one line and changes to white signs . later a lot of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you wish to compare quickly text , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the compar@@ atively window . &quot;
one function that made a lot of work was the same and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way @-@ merge is fully supported . this is useful when two persons operate independently of each other at one piece of co@@ ders and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and at the same time showing the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge the complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with the folder @-@ merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of current color monitors . if you have to verify it frequently , you will like this feature . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and t@@ ul@@ ators are shown to be visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column at the left side . ( no more trouble , when Yemen and the rec@@ ess changes . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is equal , and the other is different in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files . &quot;
&quot; if all the files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself complete the typ@@ ing work by complete the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folders 1 folder 3 folders .
&quot; opening @-@ dialog allows to type fil@@ en@@ ame of fil@@ en@@ ame , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the file list . you will not have to specify a third file for the next time ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences are performed with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the default or merge of folders is introduced , for B and C , however a folder , then uses &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if assembled , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set a output file . you can get this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialogue with settings . here you can specify options before starting with the same / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening @-@ dialog you need to select no files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop off , drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it drop over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to upload two appropriate files to it in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; now you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections . now , you can simply copy and compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you can get nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case @-@ drop of text in a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the pulling and insert text into another program than cut and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case your original data might be lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text box is the info line . the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the drawing number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest a while on the line . then , a small b@@ ble window will show the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source codes are the letters A , B and C . a is the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( this preference may be changed over the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , one sees at the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( lead ) well to see . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text there is the sky@@ line column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages the color is not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white signs are relevant only in character chains and comments , relevant to Pre@@ v@@ essor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the contrac@@ tion column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the drawing change is activated , the line will be dot@@ ted to the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison window ) also has an info line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; it changes &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , saving disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference in the same time has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group is indicated in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a jump of position in the windows , where the start of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with colour background color for up @-@ to @-@ date and on the left appears a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t have any more line remaining in the group through manual editing ; no line is displayed in the row ; no line is displayed in the file . however , this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and paste it elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; contrac@@ tions conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the window window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if you select the sources , ignore or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ates mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can also use the arrow buttons , right , end , Str@@ g @-@ beginning and Str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the window window , you can also use the other keys to edit . with the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ ting and re@@ writ@@ able mode . ( default is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
&quot; one click with the left mouse button in one of the assembly columns , synchron@@ izes all windows to the start of each group ( as already described in the section and explains the edi@@ table window ) . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ below / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ Bild downhill ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Strasbourg / Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or conflict . therefore , there must be distinction between sol@@ dered and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option however careful , because you could accidentally over@@ write the content of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; they are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a sign @-@ in character \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ er + foref@@ ace . K@@ diff@@ 3 reserves the dra@@ wer of the source files . therefore , you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ings@@ - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides scripts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in short writing . if the chosen font does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be displayed in their pure form . on these systems the button settings automatically put an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , the switches of the t@@ ator button is inserted the appropriate number of spaces . otherwise , a t@@ ator is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you input or return , the inser@@ tion of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is activated , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which dra@@ wer type you prefer to save . the pre @-@ placed value is the generally default selection on the used operating system .
&quot; the same step tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in source files . only during this first step , white signs can be ignored . the second step compares each line . in this step , white signs will not be ignored . furthermore , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon mark &apos; \ &apos; s &apos; and a poin@@ ter &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line ; others can only be stored with different sizes on the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison but then it may be treated with different sizes on @-@ to @-@ side comparison . however , as a white sign is treated . whereas the option must be de@@ activated . in default this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . in the first part of analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in Autom@@ atically rout@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; solve automatic all conflicts in white signs by using the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual choice . ) That &apos;s useful when white signs are less important in many files . note that the Autom@@ atic choice also affects conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and handling of a compilation . take a look for details under documentation on the directory @-@ comparison and contrac@@ tion .
&quot; when a file is saved and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
&quot; adapt the language of user interface . the change of this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; stop and restart , so that the change is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is globally set up over the control centre . ) &quot;
&quot; the following code settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; over the selection fields for the enco@@ ding appears a short notice , which is the local code . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ting . as the enco@@ ding is adjustable of each file , even files can be compared and merged with different code . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which enco@@ ding should be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code can be , but the pre @-@ processing command can only set with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option it is possible to command the codi@@ fication of the output sub@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to op@@ press the high@@ lighting of changes in white notes into the text or views of the text . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options ignore or ignored C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in the normal mode , all the differences are displayed in a colored co@@ ded column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; B , A &amp; B ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; B ; C ; C will be displayed next to the normal yet a second command @-@ column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ending the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
assign the same window next to each other or other . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . current file merge together , if you only use two files . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as the pre@@ placed name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot this file , then the name of the last used file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own preference to cut exactly your demands . you can use this function for example to cut out annoying parts or to correct the inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given first to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used only when drawing up the command . you can write your own preference , which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow the user to better flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program yourself . however , the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient . &quot;
use this pre @-@ editor sub@@ commands to convert the input into capital letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ s \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ &apos; . \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ U \ \ \ &apos; . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in the first gear string . \ \ U transforms the text found in large letters .
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ de@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another sub@@ processing sub@@ commands for hands @-@ on appropriate . sed &apos; s / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and each hit is replaced by nothing but almost deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several times at a time . then you can separate the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; use to separate the compositions from each other . for example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different like per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos; s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Rec@@ eption / switches &apos; However , per@@ l needs some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the submitted &quot; \ \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the data according to the normal ser@@ tion , are maintained for the display and for it . the further operations change only the data that the hand @-@ like al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can be seen . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal ser@@ tion , the poin@@ ter report provides the output of normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful but as with any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to process many files in a folder . for this reason you can compare with &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge together . &quot;
... &quot; makes a suggestion for each object ; you can adapt the proposal before starting , &quot;
... can the simul@@ ate simul@@ ate and displays the simul@@ ated changes without really perform , &quot;
... &quot; sets selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 button ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to the merge and merge of individual files very similar . you just need to folder a folder on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folders are merged , the folder 1 is used as the basis . if no target folder was specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not that together . to launch that , you must press the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 button . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder , you will be notified of a small news window on the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folder , only the files are listed , which were compared to that . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file , and any folder that has been found during scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the picture , or by clicking the arrow buttons for the left / right . the listing includes two functions All sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories , with which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; click on a file , the file will be started immediately and it will appear a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in column name reflects the dat@@ at@@ ype in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the dat@@ at@@ ype is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case , the assembly action will not be automatically selected . if that will bring together , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , the color is also identical , although the age of entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folder are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then , Fol@@ der the same color . if folders , the age is im@@ material for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ aut . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf again , which is only green , then yellow is and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
&quot; a , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A a folder and B file is ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same dat@@ at@@ ype ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting data types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , it cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; the mode to syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directories are active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action from so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge together and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for output file only B ; right after merge copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged , then select the new file instead of contrac@@ tion ( uncertain ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; while the merge is run one file after another . it &apos;s status column shows Fer@@ gh@@ an , if it was successfully completed , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages , if something un@@ expect@@ edly entered , you should make a last check and check if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the furnishing dialog the file @-@ method Full analysis is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 further columns is displayed . these contain the number of un@@ settled , sol@@ vers , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be displayed when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all gathering actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can merge it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a target folder , then in the three @-@ folder mode C will be used as a goal to merge with the two @-@ folder , B as a destination and for syn@@ cing becomes A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check whether all entries are going to be in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unnecessary surprises : &quot;
to bring all entries together : select directory together / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) to perform only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting file types still exist , a message appears that indicates the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; if you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options to guide , simul@@ ate and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulation if you would like to see what would happen , without the real changes to be done . you will then get an exhaustive list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then results in certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merged to a single file ) , then a merge window will pop up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , choose another directory together / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next record continues . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will find some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been mis@@ guided individually , notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and guides them at the later merge all entries . even if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; No diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called register @-@ merger with these options :
only files that adjust to the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; .@@ valid space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree ; it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as divi@@ ders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ zed files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder can be adjusted with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( check in info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a trans@@ cript attribute . a file is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are displayed in the elementary @-@ tree or not . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are switched . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; when left to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are switched off . if the option is switched on , the links such as normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; do not result on possible recur@@ sions , and &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; cras@@ hes . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; introduces a complete analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ vents , un@@ occupied , non@@ - white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files that contain no text . ( give an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be faster , only the amendment , and the file size . however , this speed will cost you a degree of security . please use caution . this option is in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to confidential date . there is no real comparison . the files are considered as identical if they are equal in size . this option can be useful , e.g. when copying the amendment to be lost . please note with caution . this option is in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the sync mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the proposals are selected so that both folders are identical in both folders . this option is switched off in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences instead , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file was not modified also . you should check this in any case . ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , then it will be deleted without further backup . this option also affects the normal merge of individual files , not just merge the whole folder . this option is switched on default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folders merge to merge individual files visible ; you can switch to the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want , you can switch the config folder in window menu and switch between the two views through the folder &amp; text window . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking it . however , you can create a single file directly from the menu . as soon as you save the result , the status will be executed directly and the file will not be combined once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : register menu : new to read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ de@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , which are based on local or remote machines . &quot;
the first command line compares a local file with one on a FTP server . the second command line compares a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
&quot; a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider : &quot;
a path can be relatively . or .. . this is possible with URLs not possible ; these are always absolute .
special characters must be masks . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ eboard &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used , it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be differ@@ ed if a link indicates a file or a folder . then , a file is assumed as a link object . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore the per@@ missions or the change date from the original . ( note the option confidential to the size . ) ( This is only possible at local files ) .
&quot; the main purpose of uses is currently as the differences in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op will first always start the built @-@ in differences . to launch K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences . then select In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part see from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is applied as a K@@ Part , the input file is a patch file in uniform format . then cap@@ tures &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch has to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . moreover , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part of being executed , it supports only the same of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merge or the same of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( well , it is comp@@ ars ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I use GPL @-@ programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or are going to go .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script is not informed the right pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not locate resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs are different , these lines are treated as identical . if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as un@@ identical . if the lines are next to each other , this is the case of the case . &quot;
the editor will notice any difference in the files where he begins and where it ends . this is necessary to resolve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and selecting the button . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to design an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was far too big . you can recover a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used for another editor .
after removing text is suddenly he@@ als ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t ; appeared and the text cannot be extingu@@ ished . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for lifting differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and missed the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and failure reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
&quot; information on how you can use K@@ de@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , you can find on the homepage . &quot;
you can find a list of recent changes under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir is the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Mail@@ ing@@ lists thereof . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Um@@ br@@ alt removal ) copies the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Um@@ br@@ alt inser@@ tion ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current curr@@ ing position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences are displayed : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in actual program version , you need to re@@ read the folder in these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences do . that leads also that identical files will not be copied in the target folder . if the target folder these files are not already included , they are probably missing after it . ( the behaviour is probably amended in a later program version ) This option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; if you click on one of the buttons A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached from the corresponding window to the end of the selected group in the window window ( if they are already present ) , they will be removed when clicking on the button accordingly . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . under@@ difference in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white signs .
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ show of all virtual working environments . it is quite handy to see the ongoing programmes on the working areas , to change their size or move it . this works both within a desktop and for several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space , as well as the current applications . the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked on : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the context menu has to set up just the two entries P@@ ager . however , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries are minimize , maxim@@ izing , On desktop and finish . the commands cause the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when attached to an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual work@@ space . appears only when attached to an application .
&quot; if this junction box is marked , windows can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; it can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , the name of the virtual work@@ space is displayed . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager be displayed ; the numbers of virtual working spaces are displayed . it is connected together with name , the names containing folder figures are provided , &amp; b ; 1st working space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs will be displayed as small windows in &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working space will be displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple view@@ points with the proportions of the program window . symbol displays the windows with its default symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager will be determined : classic lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager be noted , as well known from P@@ ager applications in some other Windo@@ w@@ man@@ ders ; wa@@ vering shows all virtual working areas in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical series , which is very good for the display side on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can display and move in size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their content . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and then select type of switch ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment this cannot be changed in the dialogue settings , but you can do it manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ ag@@ err@@ c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. if you do not want to register as user root or log in to your system administrator . in this file , you must register the key win@@ do@@ w@@ transpar@@ ent@@ mode and add to this one value . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on weak machines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen is displayed . below , this window is shown as a magni@@ fying window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is listed below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , it may be magni@@ fied ; the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a movable l@@ upe . alternatively , you can create a selected screen area in the enlargement window ( selection window ) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the screen ( eg . on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in enlarged windows is shown , select the cursor mouse cursor . please note that the cursor is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse cursor . this is always the default file ; / Q@@ t ; mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the document window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can change it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in enlar@@ ging window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can move the contents of the enlar@@ ging process and move it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key ; in addition , press &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ window remains firm and only the lower right @-@ hand corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; it might have a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert into a file , into the cli@@ p@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , the image rot@@ ate and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the stamp of the update causes the needed CPU time against 0 .
&quot; select the actu@@ alization rate ( Very small , low , low , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will appear . the selected area is displayed in a window .

&quot; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor is a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive Stra@@ ins @-@ Syndrome syndrome ) and which every mouse @-@ click pain prepares . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse click , once the mouse @-@ cursor is a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people who are at repeti@@ tive punishment in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; can handle pain that arise when clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without any pain . unfortunately , you may also suffer from the mere absence of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; pain helps prevent the clicking with the mouse , it is against pain that is caused by means of the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can vary for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; is simple : &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; monitors your mouse movements and leads a mouse @-@ click , as soon as you break the movement shortly . &quot;
&quot; is the smart move activated , makes &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; a break after it has em@@ ulate the mouse button . now move the mouse , waiting it down to the end of the exercise , before the det@@ ach is exec@@ uting the mouse button . in this way you can execute the pulling of mouse button . in this way you can move the pulling of mouse button . this smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly . &quot;
this mal@@ ady must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click out .
&quot; is intelligent shifting switched on , the turn@@ table is switched ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; mou@@ th@@ ool ; after shut@@ down the mouse button wa@@ its before it let the mouse button down again , if there is no account for the mouse . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; now supports the click through mouse @-@ postpon@@ ement . if this function is activated , a click with the right mouse button . a slow down to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow down to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . the first time is started , but they can later be changed . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears to be delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction time . open the &amp; k@@ server center ; go to sound &amp; multimedia , select there sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der sound bu@@ ffer to shor@@ ts you at a lower value to shor@@ ten the answer times . &quot;
&quot; is this setting marks , &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please use the respective documentation at rate to find out how you can start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; sets all settings to the values returned , which were set by opening the dialog . have you already de@@ pressed the button , the settings will be put back on the status after the last drag of the dialog . &quot;
&quot; best to use &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool ; first using the preferences . in particular , the intelligent shifting should you start off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may need to reduce the answer times of &amp; k@@ de ; to lower sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in places in the browser window , which does not constitute a link , doesn &apos;t lead to in@@ consistent reactions . therefore , you can park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse rests , you should clean@@ se your mouse . this is usually rather simple . the trick is that you can not only clean the cursor , but also the roles that touch with the ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the cursor . as this happens , the mouse is different to mouse . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . the dirt and the dir@@ ties can easily be used with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; if you just use a wrong move , this means that &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool means that the operation is no longer able to end the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths , using another window manager and move a window . &quot;
the solution to this problem is that you even run a mouse @-@ click . this is reset the status of &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; and you can continue to work as usual .
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; continue to carry mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another point . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor back there , where you want to have it . but do not park your mouse on a neutral area of the working space , if you are unable to make a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . secure zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; win ; the gray areas for the tool@@ ing and menus and the front @-@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shifting is an advanced function of &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board , to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and to re @-@ insert it once more . here are some advice to it : &quot;
&quot; use the smart move not , if you just start using &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths ; click on the text instead : perform the Shift key down , while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and once again pressing the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; please use the audi@@ ble mouse click . by doing so , if &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so , you know exactly when when the smart shifting time begins . later , you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but for this , it requires some practice . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ ths , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow must be installed ; it should be the case on most systems already . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is available only if the system has a sound card and speaker and it is correctly decorated .
&quot; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse @-@ mouse as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor briefly dist@@ res@@ ize . this program was developed for people that suffer from the R@@ SI syndrome and who prepares the actu@@ ation of the buttons . &quot;
&quot; &amp; mou@@ th@@ mou@@ th@@ ool , can also be configured so it is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins before the mouse button will start . in this way , the pulling and scanning with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth , is a program that allows the mu@@ te user to speak to their computer . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user may choose from a list with the talk of propositions which are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) enter the command , which will later be used for the voice edition of text . for more details , please see the description of the furniture . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text password . from the text pass@@ able books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third hand ( right scre@@ enshot ) you determine the dictionary for the words of words . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can select the word lists with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that it can only be used correctly sp@@ elled words into the words of words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially a input field for the keyboard goods of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a s@@ lag of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth , you can enter correctly the propositions you want to hear . each spoken sentence is hung up . each spoken sentence is hung on the path memory . you can choose from it , which should be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu @-@ entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two card cards , voice output and settings , the site Wor@@ ter@@ ti@@ ation as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the Advertising tab , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection field below the input field , you specify the character enco@@ ding to be shared with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two types to pass the text . select the junction box , if the text is to be distributed as a standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the junction box is not selected , the text will be shared as parameters . you can use the following space for placing : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to the language issue depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as t@@ ect@@ ant as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings are available on this site and is currently further developed in SV@@ N . the option of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text password or in the l@@ list for text password books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant , the selected text passage will be directly spoken and inserted in the data storage . with the selection of In the input field , the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the text box for text pass@@ book , you can specify whether the text Reg@@ istered book when closing the editing process should be automatically saved . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ able book , the book will be saved . if you choose any changes , the text password is not saved . select before store , will be stored &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text password is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ ti@@ ation contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the name and select the language for dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads to the desired language ; for documentation , the frequency of individual words is determined simply by lowering the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with a Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary to add just correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you set a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new defined words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary , over time . &quot;
the main area of the window to edit text password @-@ books is two @-@ divided . in the upper part the text pass@@ codes are presented as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit an selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the related key@@ note , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; promotions such as new text passages or books add or select text passages and books , you can either reach either the selection in the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text password or text passages , you can change through pulling with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt . key . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if the input field is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the s@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text @-@ section is selected , it will be used otherwise , otherwise the selected areas of the storage box . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . in case of text in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the s@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if the tool@@ bar is crossed by default , a postpon@@ able tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is placed by default via the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ click the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; if this menu is crossed out , a narrow Le@@ iste is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if the menu item is crossed by default , a switch list for text pass@@ able books with entries is displayed . the Le@@ iste is arranged by default over the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ click on the refined left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another place . &quot;
&quot; probably , you do not have the command for language output right or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General settings and enter the command for voice output on the card issue . ( see Settings dialog for voice and izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a language issue at the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ tically supported . the license allows to re@@ use the festival free of charge and re@@ distribute it without restrictions . &quot;
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival / festival is then :
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a new language generator . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . currently , he only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to re@@ use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and to re@@ distribute it without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the language issue , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language output is then possible with one of the three following command : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default files . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen into a Wav@@ ed@@ ei , hence you need an additional program to de@@ comp@@ ose the text in Ph@@ on@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in Ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax wants to be the last sign of the text , so an additional character has to be added . the complete command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data as default files must be switched on .
&quot; the VO @-@ D@@ dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interfaces for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is only carried out in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use as act@@ less as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust it , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the recruitment dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ ph ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for language generator ) , which depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who can not speak the text through the machine . it is saved a list of previously pro@@ vision@@ ed sentences , which the user can always make new spending again . &quot;
&quot; note that &amp; k@@ mouth , no voice should be included . on the computer , a language should be installed . &quot;
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; one or start your help@@ desk help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system of &amp; k@@ de ; - is one of modules of existing service , which allows every application to read text about the &amp; D@@ Bus ; interface . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a particle system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice @-@ over@@ s ( T@@ TS ) ; it provides a common use interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmer ready to be equipped with which their applications with T@@ TS skills . also the users offers it interesting options .
&quot; read texts ( or parts thereof ) at the text editor &amp; K@@ ate ; even if &amp; K@@ ate ; into other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are embedded there . &quot;
&quot; the VO is done via the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background program such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows the production of language spending on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) about the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; aid program .
&quot; in Z@@ UK@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;

&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ t , you need to install program speech disp@@ at@@ cher and adjust correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s or as long as yet no speaker are set up , the card holder is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card holder is generally displayed . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should also set up multiple variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should at least use a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use as the program speed @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the default speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable to several printing presses for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card holder in k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the card holder is displayed . it will then automatically start when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and is not yet an speaker . &quot;
all already decorated speakers appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear above in the list . the first speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
&quot; click with a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on the button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on the button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; click with a mouse @-@ click on the list , and click on the button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the speaker in the list determines also their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; choose a m@@ p@@ ty@@ p here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a young and maid voice . &quot;
&quot; click here , appears on the new speaker at the card holder . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can read &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card General , and check whether to activate voice @-@ over@@ s ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so that the T@@ TS Service from &amp; k@@ de ; use to read text message . click on the card orders to create and manage text entries . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the video system from &amp; k@@ de ; click the card holder General to open this card holder . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; tick this junction box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts successfully , the box orders will be shown and read text orders . see . remove the mark@@ er , the K@@ TT@@ SD is hal@@ ted and the T@@ TS @-@ System of &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; when k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ops ; continue to activate the field &apos;s speech ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; this junction box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr appears during the pre @-@ read automatically in the system of the Control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre@@ read is complete . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can launch text orders , stop and resume . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board , or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for one order . &quot;
&quot; click to apply or OK , all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD was launched . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the card @-@ card General and cross language output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text of the indicated website . check first , whether it &apos;s going to be read and select in the main menu tools read text . after short time , the speech should begin . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; you can read the text indicated . check first whether it &apos;s going to be read ; then select the text , which is to be read , and select in the main menu tools to read text . then , the speech should begin . &quot;
&quot; this also works if &amp; K@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , like &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which you will be notified of events . you can also read the text of these news from &amp; kt@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; conversation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages ; for example , you can set up various types of messages ; for example , you can notify you when a IR@@ C channel occurs in which your nickname . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the IR@@ C communication text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing board provide a good way to correct and correct messages ; the file K@@ mail .x@@ ml , which is included for delivery of &amp; kt@@ ops ; it &apos;s a good example . you removed the tags and b the term / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with t@@ ect@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is processed , before he gets sent to the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to choose incorrect words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to get certain shortcomings of voice and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filtering , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen revisions has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of screen reader is pre@@ viewed , the requested orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; b ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of warning .
&quot; news have the next highest priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application , the messages used . while you can read a long text on a website , you can watch with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about this . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order , which you encounter from the card orders , is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application , the text orders . text contracts are intended for issuing longer texts that have no particular urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except for the issu@@ ance of screen readers . if an application reads the output of a screen readers , while he reads this issue , this output is stopped and termin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters will never be applied to the output of screen revisions . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders , as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; news . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at the moment there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can still be further types of filters .
not@@ ches replace parts of a text by other text . the parts you can specify either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; is delivered with pre @-@ defined strings as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; re@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with speaker op@@ tionally , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program you sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; if you have sent a female voice to an example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter does not apply to his rules , he will remain the text unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is sent , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ am ; it is processed by all activated filters supplied on the page below . the processing takes place in the order from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not available , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be processed from above down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and it will be displayed on the following furnishings . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of string steps , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as compar@@ atively pattern . these patterns will be found in the text , then the text will be replaced with the associated replacement text . large - and lower spelling is not observed when compared . &quot;
enter your filters a name . this name allows you to choose any number you just need to distinguish from the names of the other filters .
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compares the text with the strings in column , and replaces it in accordance with the string . the list is shown from above down@@ wards . &quot;
click here to move the marked word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular excerpts from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries are app@@ ended from the file to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered , the filter is only applied if the speaker is used for the text contract one of the languages mentioned here . you can also select multiple languages if you click the button @-@ click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by Kom@@ mat@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the applic@@ ability ID @-@ of programs receive you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; and numbers you need to we@@ ave . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator @-@ ID @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies . &quot;
&quot; the strings filter filters are applied only to the text , when all conditions are applied with an entry in the box seal filters . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all the texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words the string @-@ typ@@ ing filter copy filter printed in the form \ \ s Word \ \ s. the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( space characters ) . &quot;
&quot; in this hand@@ book you will find no instructions to write regular excerpts . if you have the &amp; # 160 ; S@@ eller &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Regulation &amp; # 160 ; prints can be found in the pack@@ et package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; trans@@ former transl@@ ating &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ shaped XML . the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached on the environment variable path is also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; using the spokes@@ man filter you can send texts to a particular speaker , which is specified on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can for example set that texts from an e @-@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ops ; a text attached to the filters , there is a spokes@@ person for the text . the speaker is selected based on the narr@@ ator properties which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ops ; and the properties of the tra@@ der ticket speakers are selected . with the spokes@@ man filter you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied , if the text is applied to the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; S@@ eller &amp; # 160 ; prints , you can access this by clicking on the button to help you enter the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , begin the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you determine the properties of the requested file format . if the text indicated the above filtering conditions , the speaker is selected , which corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your spre@@ ader settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the spokes@@ man filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions with an entry in the box seal filter apply if they apply . you must enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the VO API , from &amp; k@@ de ; to give the programmers their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice should be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that it can use the synthes@@ izer ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;

&quot; I have installed the &amp; HTML , -@@ XML ; -@@ converting filter , but when using the module for the festival web pages are not read . &quot;
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) Voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able at all works . you will also need to do that if you do not use this voice to pre@@ read websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and about the ambient variable path .

&quot; the voice should be used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license , which you can find in the associated documentation or on the linked websites . there are also votes that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; from it . &amp; kt@@ ops ; can be downloaded in the folder . furthermore , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ fici@@ ally under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

&quot; American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS also works with every language en@@ izer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above languages may be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; for information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a adap@@ table module @-@ architecture for voice @-@ purpose . if you want to bro@@ aden &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , contact the developer team . &quot;
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; but conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ops ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ delicate and the developer files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source texts from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive , you have downloaded the Tar@@ ball and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you &amp; kt@@ ops ; use , check first whether speech disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your language preferences . therefore , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ trans@@ pt SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ops ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; which uses the program speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the program k@@ tt@@ king gr is to be developed so advanced that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script &apos; SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user may go back , repeat the pro@@ posi@@ tional or ab@@ dic@@ raft , repeat the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can indicate the characteristics of the preferred speech for the output . thus , if you have set up an speaker , whose language is female and whose gender is female , it is automatically selected the best appropriate speaker . if you wish to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ops ; a speaker will choose to see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card Ticket to add , and therefore click on a speaker in the list or click Edit , the card holder is displayed for festival Interactive . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . for details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival programme . if the path to the festival is included in the path , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character enco@@ ding for text , which will be handed over to festival . in votes , the &amp; kt@@ ops ; known , this setting will be done automatically . generally , the Western language is using ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 , on @-@ eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with this sli@@ der , allow volume , intercom speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ator and display this grey , the voice you choose can not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes need to load multiple seconds on account of their size . if you mark this junction box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with much storage consumption ) the first sentence is synthes@@ ized faster . &quot;
&quot; if this junction cannot be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to apply to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this junction box marked , at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is displayed in the startup window . otherwise , after the start is only the symbol k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this junction box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . this way , you have the possibility to read or control the device . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the currently edited proposition . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card holder . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row you can order sat@@ bil@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , - or go back . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click OK , all changes in settings ( on the other card cards ) will be reduced and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound@@ system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card holder audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text entries are listed and managed . issues of Screen revisions , warnings and messages are not displayed . further information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; can be found in . &quot;
&quot; here you select the type of audio @-@ output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ops ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or t@@ ect@@ ts ; cannot load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ code for the audio is to be used , choose the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the microphone speed here . 50@@ C ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ 0s ; % of about double normal talk speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply to the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of the Al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this card card , you can set special promotions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the output of screen revisions has the highest priority . it is presented to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the saved orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warning added the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; b ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the issue of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message under@@ breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks the news . if you find &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome that straight the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text contract is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a screen readers , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio @-@ output into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text is interrupted . if both introductory sound as well as introductory message is played , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card list are only applicable for normal text entries . for news , warnings and issues of screen revisions , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;

&quot; you can enter the properties of the desired speaker . default select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card holder as the top entry . see for this too . &quot;
&quot; notice that there are three levels of events . for a specific event of a certain application an action is specified , it will be executed . otherwise , action for all other events of particular application is executed . as a latest option , the action for wearing , which has been specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;

&quot; Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a language issue . this standard contains trademarks for the control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume , of sex , and sound height . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation by for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently it supports &amp; kt@@ ops ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are present :
&quot; you must install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tically masculine ) , as this is the default script that uses the festival in the version of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings are set for speed or sound at the Festival configuration dialog , SS@@ ML text is usually performed very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filter and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ S@@ s ) . SB@@ Ds split text into individual phrases . thus , the first sentence is syn@@ ced - not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop or stop and break down , even if the voice should not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the statutes filter . at the first starting from &amp; kt@@ t ; it is automatically set up when a pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is automatically set up . you can change its settings , or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional access filters , but will be distr@@ acted upon it . &quot;
&quot; easiest to learn the setup of speaking countries by sample . place the speaker selection off and enter text to pres@@ et . check out the spre@@ ader selection again , modify some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . for this , you will of course have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the pre@@ read can begin , as only the first sentence must be processed and not the whole word block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; they can then stop or break down orders on the card orders , even if the speech is not supported this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . he cannot be switched off , just removed . change nothing at this filter so unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional signs and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal number 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( tab are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter shall be retained .
&quot; SB@@ D filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; news ( node ) , warnings , messages or the issue of screen . &quot;
&quot; if you have a look from the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , you can insert it again by charging the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card holder , you can write the spokes@@ person for the application . the card @-@ card will be displayed when the card holder is displayed . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top one on the card holder ) . in other words : there are no speakers .
&quot; the use of the appropriate speaker , which displays all the properties of a appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; this speaker from . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ops ; the speaker from , the most likely the original properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired address properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; here you can choose the properties of the desired talk . if this property doesn &apos;t matter , you don &apos;t give anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this junction box , if the property is supposed to have preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; because the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always considered a priority feature . the only case , in which you may want to specify the attribute language , lies ahead if you know that a certain application is sent in another language other than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the speaker , the most likely to delete the following , click on the default button , and then use speakers , the best corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is given for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the entry is 0 required ) . &quot;
k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support but I do not get back tracking .
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is shortened and t@@ ect@@ ant ; it was closed . probably you have to install G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved by G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ exten@@ amer . you can try to update G@@ exten@@ amer or un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; the audio @-@ issue over Al@@ sa does not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ops ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that said : &apos; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is a problem that conflicts with Al@@ sa occur which prevent a simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . references to possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa @-@ Project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ U@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I downloaded an additional voice for the festival from the internet . I installed it and can use them in the festival but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ s.@@ For the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL , on which you found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . so that this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and be able via the environment variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers module like Festival Interactive provide yourself on the card device for speaker device , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored , when t@@ ect@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read about your own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML envelope , and set the microphone speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female Festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . thus , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the x@@ s@@ l file for converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the gender tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE @-@ tags . &quot;
I have added a own string @-@ asser@@ tion filter and now I can proceed in &amp; kt@@ t ; no longer a balance sheet . on the cart@@ on orders is shown that order just before one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , questionn@@ aires , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter . use this sign instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ der@@ ous detection . &quot;

&quot; have downloaded &amp; kt@@ ops ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar pack@@ er archive ) , sign up as regular users and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts module ; probably removed or at least have been created on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice should be created by default . some of them possess a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the column configure option to switch off the code parameter shows the configure parameter , which causes the skip step . &quot;
&quot; the default setting is installed &amp; kt@@ ops ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you need to specify as the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination . for example , &quot;

&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is revealed . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , intercom speed , and pitch @-@ height with &amp; kt@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; you have to install at least one language . help to find in the instructions that are provided with the festival . want to pre @-@ read websites , you need to install the ( male ) Voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you have to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on transmission . &quot;
this voice uses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new ones . the voice is still in an early stage . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / Res@@ / etc / Russian / . if you enter Russian voices you need to input for the voice ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ u ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) co@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
it is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; are therefore searching for the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the code has to be set to ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the enco@@ ding has to be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ery , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - Syn@@ thes@@ izer will be used . then it takes over the audio version and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this produces the audio version . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; - Parts can be downloaded from
&quot; note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language device , is generated . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create these di@@ phone . Festival generates these of &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; you can also generate additional software from German lyrics Di@@ phone . for more information please refer to . &quot;
&quot; in this procedure additional Wr@@ apper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Re@@ gar@@ b files are not installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;

&quot; this hand@@ book explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; monitor center ; allowing the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; monitor centre ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu boxes . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started through a selection of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; are started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware do not install . physical devices and their drivers have to be installed and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device also shows and the adjustment of network properties allows . &quot;
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network devices are later added , the driver must be loaded through modification of the following files , according to the core version , are loaded : &quot;
the module network settings is loaded when the option net@@ settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index selected is selected . when starting the module network settings this is trying to detect the platform used on the system automatically .
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the selected selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which the distribution and release version is best meets . by flag@@ ging the adjustment Not @-@ again , the setting can be taken permanently . when starting the network settings , this selection will be adjusted automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are shown gray , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system administration mode , you can access by clicking the button mode . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three riders : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interface serves to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from the rider network interface , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings are set up to set up networks can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking on the button to set up the button ... to be set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . clicking the button @-@ mounted settings shows the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; the TCP / IP settings are removed from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server for the system at the same time , the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all the required TCP / IP information with each system start , so there is no further adjustment required . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , are selected . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual can be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address is required . in the input field network mask is set to set the sub@@ net@@ mask . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface with boats . if the initi@@ alization isn &apos;t desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values contained in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be assured that the IP address in the network will not be used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console ; you can notice whether the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
network equipment can be activated or activated depending on the need . on an extended network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network equipment can be activated or activated depending on the need . switch off of a activated network device is de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
&quot; sets the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than one network interface , the interface must be selected to the web in which the gateway computer is placed . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the appropriate IP address . that &apos;s necessary because computer asks only IP addresses . if the machine demands htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address , such as 12@@ 3,@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine to name attri@@ bution part of the equ@@ ator name solution allows an easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be sorted by selecting a single and up@@ loading or her@@ b@@ ulation in the list with the buttons or herr@@ ing in priority . &quot;
by clicking the button Add @-@ button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name solution a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver .
&quot; first you have to enter the IP address of the DNS server , and then add the button Add to button . the entry then is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group calcul@@ ator , select one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog . &quot;
&quot; the list especially well @-@ known calcul@@ ator describes calcul@@ ator &apos;s name @-@ IP address for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily with boats when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally the list contains a well @-@ known calcul@@ ator several entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses provide this still in the test version of IP should replace in future versions 4 . &quot;
insert the IP @-@ address of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several ali@@ ases , de button add several times , and enter the further alias name . &quot;
select a name of a specially known calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit .... the dialog to edit your hosts will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then with clicking OK , the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes to activate , the following command needs to be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for installation of binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , it ranges when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
&quot; the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is simply to download the r@@ pm , and install in one &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows : &quot;
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as the package or the installation tool for your distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not enough , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are required . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to compile them . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental networking technology will be reviewed in the second section of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files . &quot;
&quot; this area can not replace more knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PCs is conve@@ yed in a small ( home ) network . &quot;
IP @-@ networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found in the near future . this description is therefore concentrated on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is knowledge which is to assign the IP @-@ address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the gateway to which a valid IP address can be used or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can not be used any number . &quot;
&quot; when setting up a private ( home ) network , IP address should be selected from a specially selected range for this purpose to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded in the Internet , therefore its any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be made by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks are usually used in the range of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 , the area is big enough for networks to 250 machines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set on 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second @-@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own machine ) . the default route is required for the IP @-@ re@@ directing . &quot;
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP @-@ traffic in the local own machine . usually the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this section the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file is sometimes dynam@@ ically changed at DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in case of active DSL connections any other content can be found there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file can be sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected as expected . &quot;

&amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs after a schedule in the background . it is a graphic interface for the &amp; UNIX system cr@@ on .
&quot; at the start of &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can see a list of already listed tasks and per@@ taining environment variables . if you use &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; as root , this appears both for all users of the system and for systemic internal tasks . each folder can be recorded and folded . &quot;
&quot; in a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not displayed and displayed under description will be disabled . &quot;
the environmental variables available here represent the otherwise existing ambient variables for all tasks listed above . in a de@@ activation variable appears as a description de@@ activated .
&quot; to create a new task , select first the folder folder . then proceed in the menu to Edit New .... Acc@@ ording to that you can also click with the right mouse button on the tasks folder and select in the next context menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; here enter the name of the start@@ ling program . you can either specify a relative or an absolute path@@ name . if you want to search the program first , please press ... &quot;
select the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; you can specify the minutes in fifth progress .
&quot; the program will be executed as well as week@@ day ( e ) as well as week@@ day ( e ) , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th and Sunday , the program will be executed on the 1st and 15th of the months , regardless of which date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the c@@ ron@@ tab is stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut a task , select the first task at first . go to edit . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select button , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select first the task at first . go to Edit copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , must first be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , inser@@ tion is available at all . select the task folder . go to Edit folder . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the tasks &quot; folder and insert , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , select first . then go to the menu &apos; Edit Change .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and change you ... click , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O It will then be able to edit the dialog , in which you , as described above , can process the selected task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the assignment . then go to the menu item editing . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it , and determine the state with the menu item editing . in@@ active tasks are identified in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task with the right mouse button and select stock . make sure to check out that program name , parameters and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to execute a task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , select first the variable folder . then go to menu item Edit new .... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable folder and select New ... , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
type the name of the variable . you can also select one from the list of the most commonly used environmental variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable names . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the back @-@ back program to another as the normal address
&quot; as with the creation of new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab is stored . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , select first the variable vari@@ able . go then to edit . &quot;

&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a ambient variable , first one must cut off or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the option is even available at all . select the variable folder . go to Edit folder . then go to Edit folder . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to edit variable . then proceed to edit change ... select button , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O .@@ It then appears the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete a ambient variable , select first the variable . go then to Edit Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; to enable or de@@ activate a ambient temperature , select it , and place the state with the menu item import@@ ation . in a de@@ activated variable , appears under description de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variable and select stock . make sure that name and value of variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; if all tasks and ambient variables have been entered or changed , you still need to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item saving . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S . changes or supplements to tasks or variables will be active only then . &quot;
&quot; it appears the default file ; -@@ print dialog . in case you select out , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced per@@ missions .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of users . &quot;
&quot; a P@@ OS@@ IX compliant &amp; UNIX ; for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : is a backup programme for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the second goal was to answer a surface for tar that created my wife : how much longer it takes , when you secur@@ es ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be taken from &amp; k@@ dat ; it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&amp; k@@ dat ; sp@@ ar the band back and reads the pre@@ tension information of the belt . det@@ ects &amp; k@@ dat ; the for@@ er@@ aman on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat : the pre@@ spell , is looking for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , changes the symbol for the band@@ run , to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched out for the volume . &quot;
&quot; prior to throwing the belt , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to do this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat : there is a change in the symbol for the tape , that the integration of the band was solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be rejected without danger . &quot;
before a band of &amp; dat files can be used it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; dat .
&quot; a band@@ types have to be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not correspond to the form@@ atting with &amp; dat files . it does not have to be form@@ at@@ ted prior to using the belt type , DAT drives , however , do not have to be form@@ at@@ ted . flo@@ ppy band@@ ages are usually not form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
after entering the band@@ name and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape go lost ! after completion of the form@@ atting process the belt is automatically involved and is ready to use .
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the required files . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in the local file tree . it is only backed by this file , or the folder . &quot;
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
&quot; select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured . &quot;
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ ps ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings , dialogue will be secure . the dialogue shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it is only checked the selected file , or the folder . &quot;
&quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked . &quot;
right click in one of the archives and select the menu entry .
&quot; once the test process was started , the dialogue settings will be displayed for verification . in this dialog , you can once again review your selection and change the working folder for veri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialogue will review over@@ see . this dialogue demonstrates the progress of the process process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the re @-@ establish , the files you should be restored , this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives , which belong to the entry for the band@@ run . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot;
&quot; right click on a file or folder in one of the archives , and select in the menu . &quot;
&quot; once the re @-@ creation process was started , the dialogue will appear to restore . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialogue shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data set and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file from the band@@ content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of tape .
this will create a backup profile with the straight selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of files will be automatically updated according to the chosen working folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders , which are listed under backup files , that only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder that are on other fil@@ esystem , you may register separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is secured , only the files have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ creative backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
&quot; the functionality of buttons files &amp; gt ; and he@@ als ; files , files was not yet completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation . &quot;
you can set up the settings via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the band@@ work station ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ print version of the band .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat before the tape is integrated , the command will be p@@ ated to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the throw from the belt drive to block . possibly this attitude does not work with all band@@ run plants . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , the lo@@ gically of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat files ; automatically the volume is ej@@ ected . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy @-@ Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ working block size for the band@@ work station . not all drives support variable block@@ sizes . no matter whether this setting is active or not , you must communicate &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band@@ work . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat : a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file at the beginning of the belt . this file should only show a storage block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The Band @-@ ID . the format of this string is billing . seconds , with calcul@@ ator the full name of the system has been form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds the number of seconds has passed since the epoch in which the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band @-@ ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .@@ dat files .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be controlled directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar admin@@ ister . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not work for incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ector . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can get information about your system or where the system allows the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; System@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ systemic log ; helps users understand what makes your machine in the background , is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is stored by the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; System@@ log ; experienced users allow quick access to information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore tries to provide some enhanced features , with whose help the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ systemic log ; a number of useful features include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the next chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; features available , with whose help the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtering and sor@@ ting . the individual options for sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the main protocol of the system - to open the system protocol - it will not be displayed , and it will pop up instead of a small news window , so you can usually not find with system managers . the log files are usually not found in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter the filter bar , so that only log files will be displayed automatically . in default it contains the selection range displayed next to the filters all . then , a log line contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of the filter search will be included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course also select another entry in this place . select the string process only with the entries in the correspon@@ d@@ ingly selected column . select for example in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; m@@ system log ; all protocol lines sent from this process or have been created . &quot;
this option is activated in default setting and helps you detect the key protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of the stage indication . the color @-@ color @-@ lines can be switched on @-@ line dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in cr@@ on protocol ) , this allows you to examine the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in column process such as you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to Download new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all the new log lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ systemic log ; allows you to use multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a window , select in the menu a protocol to display . &quot;
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ software @-@ software @-@ software @-@ software . you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information on the sources of &amp; k@@ systemic log ;
&amp; k@@ systemic log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system log ; in &amp; archive ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following also named as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ) ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it is rapidly developing for control of the program start @-@ off at the system in the &amp; Linux ; and therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it @-@ Bin@@ er file lies under / bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and new format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are instead of direct in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service , which you would like to start when up@@ lifting the system or when changing to another Run@@ ning level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ ever , which only once begins . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . however , most systems do not have much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to carry out a r@@ c.@@ in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one finds .
the default run@@ level is listed in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the initial range :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably will determine that the pre @-@ set run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , then you can fix it / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand then you can fix it if you restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the correct scripts ? if you enter it in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder you will not find the right files . instead , each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it really system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument such as start and stop . you can actually launch these scripts on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if a K contains , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he contains an S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could go &amp; eg ; a server @-@ running level , which leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run . in addition , I could also have a user @-@ Run@@ level , das &amp; b ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is simple to say not to say : simply draw an entry from the range of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six Run@@ es , to launch it at this level ( or stop ) . &quot;
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else . thus , the entry is removed from its original run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they remove an entry from the range of disposable system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved if you prefer to copy them into a new field . to simply select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu , even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the number of entries of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; at present , there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the t@@ ator button to enable the different work areas ( avail@@ ble system services , run@@ level 1 stop , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to post@@ p@@ one entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the number or the name of an order manually , press the input button to switch to the Properties dialog . use the t@@ ator button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; due to the risk of the data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before it can be executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are saved by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored to the preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the L@@ ILO Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single , and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and modify the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I have done some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ( or Deli@@ x ) , you must edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual for distribution . &quot;
&quot; how system services will be launched in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard has no standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution : please check if all the configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the importance of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made changes , you must save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , user interface and user groups . to select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some boxes will only be displayed when you have extended advanced settings settings . only if you have re@@ activated advanced settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , there will be a cardboard card , where you can make individual settings , if shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; the card controller will be available , in case of shadow passwords , or for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as installed in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
this card map appears only if for at least one appears file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ a group on the file system ) . here you can change parameters in each user with the restrictions on each user :
&quot; these parameters can be individually adjusted for each file system . the current file system is selected using the fil@@ esystem , with the help of the field file system . &quot;
&quot; the card details informs about the group &apos;s belon@@ gings . the default group , to which the user belongs , find in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by mark it in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group &apos;s dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the File or group or click the appropriate adding button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager to remove the boat password , remove and modify the time to boot the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , modify , change operating systems , change , change and more . &quot;
