<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility of correcting problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & publication came; tool Farms effects provides you four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a classy filter available."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, solar allization, also called Sabatier, an effect that was created when you completed a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then the delicate, dark areas darker and the colors due to the second lighting were inverted. the result was a partial negative part of the image. this tool allows you to fine this very interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity control the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity displays the picture what is chemically possible. an additional increase will eventually produce a negative image that so not to generate photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar power system. the original image is the (1) and that works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by giving it a stronger contradiction, which makes the colors brilliant and glitating. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the trademark name for one on natural daylight, made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. its name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth colors. Veloas strongly saturated color are also some photographs, especially those that little landscapes melt, too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">"the Neonfilter simulates Neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome, and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonliché. in great pictures the filter may extend the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to correct the color counter and illuminating your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you will use the button Ok and you are used.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad light ratios you can get the reversed problem: one to great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce a good choice to reduce saturation. even in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation can be reduced to you. if you like it, you can confirm the changes with ok.

<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool for shutter. it is very fast and simple, but creates, especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. in fact I can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes, and it's a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, since he really improves the loop. it is a little more complicated in his application and has different parameters for adjustment."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitalized pictures need a correction of the loop. this is the case that the digitalization process can be summed together with only minimal differences. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more intolerable than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">With JPEG images a camera has often been applied to the camera. images in the white-format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner is using a freer filter already during the reading of the picture. if you disable it, you get the control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpen a photo with the grin-train balance. this allows you to call with the menu input procedure."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should be careful about this since the results do not work very naturally: the sharpness increases the sharpness of edges, but amplifying the noise. in general, the most useful technology to sharpen one image is refocused. below refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for wear."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it to sharpen. use the tool for soft signs with the menu entry corrigidity and experiment something with settings. the window display on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter blurred mashed is a very good tool to remove Veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview of the image will help you edit. the preview display shows the version of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values frequently produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase in radius or view amplify the effect. if you make the unsharpen mask strong, they will generate noise and impression of grats in the proximity of sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius sets a like many pixels on each side of a channel by the filters. high-resolution images allow greater radio. they therefore should raise pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage of the original and the blurring image to be added to the original. this makes the strength of the sharpness set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the sultry value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use of the difference. one can thus define a minimalist difference in order for a channel of filters. in this way, areas with a soft change between the killing of sharpenes and therefore, beauty defect is avoided in faces, heavens and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of unsharp mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a sultry = 0.0. "</seg>
<seg id="496">The & publication came; tool refocused is focused on an image due to the improvement of the loop. it used to use the copyrighted discharge filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool is trying to undulate a picture & quot; refocused class quot; in which there is a better approach than just trying the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technology called FIR Wiener Filtering. you can start using a technique called FIR-mask. you can start using it from the menu by using colours refocused on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular flange works far better than the Gauls's Faltung. the Gauls'sche flaring has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result from the original pixel, which is far from the original pixel, which is far from distant pixels, which causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular loop: this is the radius of circular folded. it is the most important parameter for the use of this module. for most pictures the standard value should place good results. you can place a higher value when your image is blurred but then on halchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help reduce artifacts. the correlation may be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in smoking filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful. however, values higher than 0,1 is rarely helpful. if the smoke filter is too low, & b; 0 is the image quality very bad. a high value is added to the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauls'sche scarfs: this is the radius for the Gauls'sche scarfs. use this parameter when your blurredness Gauck is. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to increase incomparably artefacts. in most cases, you should avoid this value zero, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the smoking filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"size: this value determines the size of the transference matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular shellate or the Gauck's cord. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the area of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and loading buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any arbitrary parameters you have set will be saved for later and can be loaded then.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all cutting, dye and Intensity codes on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes are not immediately visible, but leaving later unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you want to read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally producing more blurred Maskieren better results than scarf. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than scarves.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it has to be seen as blurred masking always arming artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of insharps. for the Vienna filter you can indicate that it is the optimal linear filter. practical, the FIR Vienna filter is often better in dealing with small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused image:"</seg>

<seg id="518">"if you want to edit the filter settings, you can use the" "smoothing and advanced settings". ""</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail configuration p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothest over the picture. a value of 0.9 should therefore obtain details that no scarves is necessary. please note that the details of detail should be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"reefs Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothed evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a high value of heavy patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value close to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this puts the maximum smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. put this value therefore suitable to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter is affecting larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is done, as it is difficult to assess the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's Turbulletin, he must set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. usually enough is enough for 1 or 2.</seg>
<seg id="524">"Winkelp-wide da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, there should be small angles a long run. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step-wide [0,1 / 10]: integral loop range in pixel. you should bet the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear Interpolation use: the more quality you receive by choice of this option is only low. it doubles but the runtime. we recommend it to allow it to be allowed.</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size from 1 (3x3) to 20 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and the image is moving over the image and the color in it is plugged and thus minor bugs.</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness of the filter. this value sets the pixel forward to determine the filter changes. if it is raised, the foam filter will change. if the value is too high, the adaptive Filter image is no longer preserved and smoking or lubricating again."</seg>

<seg id="854">"the conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original description of Him is: expect from dcraw, that it produces the same results as the software from your camera performers. sometimes you get better results with dcraw better results!"</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and launch the module. the Raw image konverter window appears in the mode for a single picture. with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now re-optimize the values new to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings for the whiteels are to be used. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to process the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrasting information. if your camera works in RGB mode the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats, and the conversion ratio remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged image format, TIFF, maintains all the information of your image and uses the lossy LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or use later otherwise, you should not choose the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as storage format, the metadata that contain in the RAW file are stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF data."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have customized your settings, you can start the conversion button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can cancel it."</seg>
<seg id="863">"the stack mode mode allows you to convert various images to once. use this mode therefore, if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, you have the possibility to rewrite the existing file. this is helpful in case this is not available in an earlier attempt. however, a preview of the progress has progressed as far as the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= These setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces of acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. takes up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compressible rate about 5.5. still needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rates approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music by young people, portable devices and Autostereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this option will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is manually entered or obtained through the program automatically from the freeDB via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / use with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program additions for the Kodiers and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodierers declare the switch for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame and the title must be added by lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '... -d {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labeling in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which persons can read the audio CD, so that all other information can be downloaded in the machine, so that all other information you can download instead of yourself: & CD; titles, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (m. the writer is not a lawyer. however, nobody can prevent you from the & CD; however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there's more or less worthless so that neither the artist nor the music company cannot be added any more or less, so any information may be obtained at a bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physical or virtual."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"in many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; to use freeDB, the geographically on the next lying mirror is needed. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of reflections on the online call of & CD; information given during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which readable program is used to save pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there is rumours that is used to be cdparanoia; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed at first, if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the loaded, WAV files can be chosen by the Kodiers and thus the desired file format. in the first opening, you can pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of free compression for audio data) on the tab to set the code. other Kodiers can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the codile package must be installed by the specific Linux distribution, before the encoders can be used. this is also necessary for pre-defined coders. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welter Kodiers."</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a capacitor window (eg. console) must be replaced with the name of the installed Kodierers.</seg>

<seg id="1676">"this setting is used because GM indicates that a keyboard interface is intended to play a pitch using 4096, a tone higher. unfortunately, however, try some keyboards to play two tones up to an octave higher. to check the right value on your keyboard, you need a bit with & kmid; to try."</seg>

<seg id="1684">"well, I can not force anybody & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compress proportion of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have the control of everything."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following also named as & ksysv); this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly developing for control of the program start-off at the system in the & Linux; and therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init-Biner file lies under / bin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to make a machine on System V Init, without a reinstallation and new format. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">SysV Init differs also from BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are instead of direct in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you find rc.sysinit and the following further folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service, which you would like to start when uplifting the system or when changing to another Running level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setever, which only once begins. such calls include rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. however, most systems do not have much use for it. you can also create a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to carry out a rc.in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is listed in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the initial range:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably will determine that the pre-set runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, then you can fix it / etc / inittab by hand then you can fix it if you restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the correct scripts? if you enter it in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder you will not find the right files. instead, each entry here is a link to any of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init really system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is so written that it is an argument such as start and stop. you can actually launch these scripts on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if a K contains, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he contains an S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could go & eg; a server-running level, which leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run. in addition, I could also have a user-Runlevel, das & b; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">"here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"the use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is simple to say not to say: simply draw an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six Runes, to launch it at this level (or stop)."</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it somewhere else. thus, the entry is removed from its original runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they remove an entry from the range of disposable system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved if you prefer to copy them into a new field. to simply select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu, even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the number of entries of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"at present, there is no possibility to restore entries that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tator button to enable the different work areas (availble system services, runlevel 1 stop, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor buttons to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to postpone entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>

<seg id="2984">"I have done some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>

<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution: please check if all the configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (as & eg; Apache or httpd) just quit without notice if their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
