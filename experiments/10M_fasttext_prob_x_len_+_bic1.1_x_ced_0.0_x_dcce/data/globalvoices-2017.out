although I visited the US for at least once a year I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely great .
&quot; as many of my generation grew up with American films , American music had danced , American authors have been danced and operated in sports . &quot;
&quot; indeed , this country had profound effects on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as the 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican letter , a terrible re@@ porter who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ dents , who were much inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; me it &apos;s , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , this is what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admiration for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very warm love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
&quot; the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me , as he is dealing with his bot@@ t@@ iness . &quot;
he never holds behind the mountain with his opinion how to say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it , and publicly declare his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in s@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by the party nom@@ inee candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t get Tr@@ ump and his voters not in line with the people I met at Phoenix during my time .
&quot; as for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the Journ@@ alism programme , which took people from all over the world , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ umps of the world@@ view does not coinci@@ de with the name of Peter Bh@@ atia , the present editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our common love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ tolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced with Sandy B@@ ahr , who struggling for life long and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she is still adapting to the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values embo@@ died by they express my love of America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump his way to nom@@ inee Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart at his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , the presidency for a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were prepared to overlook these things , broke me nearly the heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , &quot; &quot; said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and respectful and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are known , voted for Tr@@ ump because they would like to regain control of a country that she disappointed us ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one cannot forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who commented the cruel decision , a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from it . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( m . WC . : as much as &quot; recording of the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; word game from white in all@@ ot@@ ment for white and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ ka@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was the great Van Jones called , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always , America is always welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land , as his President , chose twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , Donald Tr@@ umps is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise , and says : to Hell with multip@@ licity , religious freedom and all the concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ru@@ der , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
on a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; brood the crowd .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; I answered them .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they cried out , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a vocal and onom@@ ic &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now the misery country , said the message . &quot;
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero municipality in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music that is played at both places , not only the life of the children has changed , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists but worlds from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Music Association ) in the municipality : one of children and adults with existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music @-@ school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious about the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI .
once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go to their great passion .
&quot; they always come lau@@ ghing and with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , gl@@ it@@ resses , Pau@@ ks , Pau@@ line , Bon@@ go and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically at the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made of recur@@ sive waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recre@@ ated instruments that consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to transform parts of apost@@ asy into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate G@@ och , viol@@ a , C@@ elli , bass , bass , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trumpet , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion that were all made from the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article of Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez is reminded of a local econom@@ ist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no space for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place the parents worked in the trash . the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents , because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : one of waste her@@ ed violin .
today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments recovered and called The recycled Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) paints the musical performance on :
the world produces about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
those who live with him and of him are the sle@@ eves - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura . Paraguay .
and here they turn into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought .
&quot; this article , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , published a magazine that specifically reports international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re@@ publication is set within an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing fishing , before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the East African countries were correspon@@ d@@ ded accordingly , and little inclined to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this kind at its coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles quickly mobil@@ ised himself against the ship . they refused to give one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing place . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly , the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything . &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leading cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man . he is part of a team that was discovered and followed by ship . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pill@@ age of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protects , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisheries stop ) . &quot;
&quot; the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from its waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; this makes us eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand for each other at where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trusts project En@@ ding illeg@@ ally F@@ ishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is conce@@ aled , being extremely difficult to trace . thus , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing regions . &quot;
&quot; through the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and species should be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fisheries were once hin@@ dered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen nowadays in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , the individual countries can replace lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move around the open sea , with satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in rever@@ ber@@ ed areas . also , such a suspi@@ cious driver to discover that a ship has its captured fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence , where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal off@@ ender . &quot;
countries which are against illegal fishing are based on this information will then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports . so that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to the numbers of sanctions as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile itself anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales , which lose the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters . &quot;
East @-@ Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fis@@ sur@@ es who pul@@ ls the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also these illegal fishermen .
&quot; among other practices , such activities include the sailing under fal@@ cons , counterf@@ eit roy@@ papers , indication of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally fish and a country could then say &apos; you could not start my harbour . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me &quot; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal cr@@ amp is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
until now the closed front works .
since its inception F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in over 30 investigations of susp@@ ects ships .
&quot; it has discovered criminal networks , which had distributed counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships who used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has been tr@@ acked ships and found volati@@ le vessels . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is supposed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , suspi@@ cious ships to be precise . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , helps to record illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position . and we try to cross it , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chef@@ analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO , which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be made of satellite . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines various information with each other . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
one model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team for African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believe that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened together with Google and the Sea Protection organisation Oc@@ e@@ ana the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch : a platform that offers satellite data , and through which the position of every single trac@@ eable vessel can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - this is simply meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run , where a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities do not only feel criminals , but they also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships used earlier without a license and hardly expected to count on consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participating countries have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fisheries boats have more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia helped to record Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board Schle@@ pp@@ nets , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that now also other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa every year , several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , six countries joined the West Africa Task Force . they now also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model such as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; security is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country in Somalia could report his first major triumph : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under wrong flag . and not only was the ship being used without a license and got hau@@ ling nets that are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated into bot@@ bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the take of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , which proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a particular , collaborative way of working methods are actually working throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . where she writes about environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in The Guardian . location in Venezuela is continuing to say : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capturing the country . &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
&quot; they are considered to be a protest against the decision of the government , the referendum for the ministers of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot;
&quot; this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Marac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 . &quot;

&quot; after the government of Venezuela has rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on ministers , the Venezuel@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations of the political and economic crisis of the country were killed by the streets of Venezuela . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things , in the low@@ land of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , located in central @-@ eastern Bundest@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state of Nu@@ eva . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously , which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuel@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicine . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw their chance at the counterpart of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , the chance of a fundamental change ; ultimately , the management of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ar@@ ised the context of the state of government in their latest article : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence has been valued at the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to be the only way to restore its institutional structures and to join a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the election of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : r@@ round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition to the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro was put together to support the National Assembly , as well as a march to the Miraflores palace , the Venezuel@@ an Government , on the 3rd of November , should continue to persist the blocking of the referendum . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is so far to Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide strike , and on 3 November all to Car@@ acas to Miraflores . &quot;
we can tell ! pic@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Cy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela , &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the programme &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches which are published in real time , witness among other things a overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with poli@@ c@@ emen as well as support of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most common pictures shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the prot@@ esters , &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; &quot; cry this Venezuel@@ an . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; especially large waves , the message over poli@@ cem@@ an oppression in the central @-@ north town of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the demonstrators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect itself according to their own statement in front of the police and the armed advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again but the protests went further .
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters were trying to stop the police forces , including this woman in the Andes @-@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not bear skirts , because you could otherwise see something what many national di@@ sts don &apos;t have ! &quot;
meanwhile an Info@@ graphic is already making an Info@@ graphic the round that forms the amount of repression per day :
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an office process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innumerable people on the street .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of sig@@ natures are fake .
here is your ministers !
on the road !
&quot; others use these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which made little against the devastating economic crisis and would prefer to be busy with critical voices : &quot;
you took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches take more and more frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezuel@@ ans reported the media , they are too hungry to get involved in a strike instead of working or buying shopping . &quot;

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to view the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as by now , Qui@@ j@@ ano said within the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a trial in CÃ³rdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the BÃ¼r@@ de , the same name as his father to wear up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he watched at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he held the family @-@ secrets for himself .
in the situation at that time I believed that was fine .
I felt like an en@@ closure .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ er from 1974 to 1983 , a time of stat@@ eh@@ ood , was his father of State Department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , because of ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child is charged . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of atrocities that he had experienced as a boy , and who said before a national Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has one parent over his child and how this child chose for itself a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me on a military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
&quot; they all called him &quot; &quot; k@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him , and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :

that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok . for so , my father had drawn me . &quot;
at the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; at the first time and last time , he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything of that was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket wick@@ edness and commanded me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen items were parked , and he kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; over , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I entered , and saw a lying , tor@@ tured on the human being . &quot;
she looked like a field @-@ bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they were attached to an end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they rarely have a man with wr@@ ists to the bed , poured it with water and brought him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the stu@@ d@@ ank there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another ?
&quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried away . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilians who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked humans with the face below - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
in the proximity of the entrance there remained silent on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What do you see so , Ar@@ sch@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; why did you hear me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried .
I know this because my father told at home .
&quot; in addition to La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero there came a man and killed .
&quot; ( according to the general test of the Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also charged at La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the student Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; the following video runs Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the leader of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folklore chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; look at the map , see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured it for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have been changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
&quot; this was the lie , the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the eradic@@ ation of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases . &quot;
the &apos; War &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things at home .
&quot; at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war crimes are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign that one assumes an enemy that one fought a enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... are missing , then that is not a war crime but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also Officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter into a house , and to ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I rep@@ lied , and thou hast thou mi@@ est cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you walk so far , then I will find you and put yourself on your hand . &quot;
&quot; to do so , we need no one else ! &quot;
so my father was .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo from that time on which I contributed a jacket and a roll@@ er@@ pul@@ lover from wool . both my father had made up of La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he brought clothes to his home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the Defence accused me to have been a con@@ j@@ ure in this crime . I refu@@ te no problem , they can put me into the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was anyway there to pre@@ dict .
&apos;@@ Des@@ ir@@ let of the cor@@ pse is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find repentance . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you have only children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; one develops further , recognizes that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; good , so do you have ex@@ termin@@ ated during the dictatorship of people . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children are kidn@@ apping ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
one could have simply put them into prison .
&quot; I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people , but why their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to pass the remains of their remains ?
&quot; the extravag@@ ance of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act , which one can do to a man . &quot;
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , hol@@ ed them machines to eradic@@ ate the remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were sm@@ elled and somewhere ent@@ ail - no idea where . &quot; &quot; you never find something &quot; , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
&quot; I have seen how you killed humans ! &apos;
only to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to indicate my father came during a conversation , when he stood under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all of the atrocities , which I had to experience . &quot;
then he suddenly said : &quot; I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have killed anyone .
&quot; I felt inner stri@@ pped and asked me to what the whole exagger@@ ated Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to tell ?
I have seen how you killed humans !
you have committed horrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he res@@ sed only &quot; &quot; Na then I &apos;m going to . &quot;
this is what I did .
2010 I delivered the first ad .
finally I realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can pre@@ tend that I am pre@@ viewed . I finally put out against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still at the end of the process .
&quot; he was indicted for 4@@ 16 crimes : among them severe , non @-@ right freedom of imprisonment in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 154 cases , torture with subsequent death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 @-@ year child . &quot;

the judg@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the proportions of the realm . &quot;
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process ended between March 1975 and December 1978 and finally committed crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty for crimes against humanity , in 28 cases per@@ pen@@ alties and in nine cases , arrest of between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there was free spins . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 def@@ endants died during the trial .

&quot; all accused were during the dictatorship members of the military , including former military , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Piero De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and sent to La Per@@ la .
he set the following words to the silent chamber :

a translation errors makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; terrible cars &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a centre in Kyoto , where one can extend its driving licence . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
processing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened Center in which one can extend its driving licence , last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word should be used ( kor@@ ei@@ below sh@@ a ) , which means &quot; older motor@@ ists &quot; means , perhaps also with bows , &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area from 1 to 20 September .
the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine have often been divided into social media .
&quot; the mistake was made by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a local population of Ky@@ ot@@ os , he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
&quot; this proves , that no one has read the translation correction . &quot;
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation at first was removed . the name &quot; &quot; title &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible car &quot; ) was later replaced by the proper name &quot; El@@ der &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; older auto drivers &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the pre@@ fecture , apologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , it explained that the error was already included in the text that it was checked by the translator and that the translation has not been checked for its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincerely sorry that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) to our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set out a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; fear@@ less &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; horri@@ bly &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older auto @-@ drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older motor@@ ists who are involved in accidents , but also occasion for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of total caused by the elderly in 2005 . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , the Sen@@ iors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents decreased altogether , the proportion of those of seniors caused in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ named re@@ porter published in the Yahoo announced version of Article Comments to the light which demonstrate , which prejudices some Japanese are seemingly opposed to older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo , through the translation errors , has the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; terrible motor@@ ists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; so faul@@ ty is the translation at all not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a real translation errors .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true discovery for these bizarre errors in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ turn one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the output text , and active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of mother@@ language . in general , the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the language language - mother@@ language . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native language should translate from English into French , not from the French . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; a lot of Japanese companies employ no employees with English as native language , the translations into English . this may be mis@@ understanding of understanding , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even have no foreign employees , but can still be finished internally . then , the Japanese employee , his English knowledge as the best one can be added to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the pu@@ zz@@ ling and pu@@ zz@@ ling propositions emerge , which can be produced by machine translation , show that this technique does not substitute for a long time to no human translator . this applies to some languages very special . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often use T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry , or at least harmless . but of large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto will hopefully be using a serious source for their translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Frei@@ es surfing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute for press and society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday evening , the 7th of April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users had no access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the Internet site of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV could no longer be accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers handed over recordings of the protests in Car@@ acas that were organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court was dissolved , and the European Parliament &apos;s role was transferred to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection may be kis@@ sed , and recommended the users to get VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages ven@@ e@@ gian provider are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the dental vene@@ ers with internet access , especially in times of unrest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission for tele@@ com@@ s would be reporting them with fin@@ es and lock@@ ers when they continue to report on the demonstrations as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that this continues to be cheaper than two lit@@ re le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online stations . this also applies to the Internet site to which the National Assembly is holding its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier post @-@ research of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet provider will sometimes use DNS . this is a technique , by which the DNS server requests certain domains will answer . &quot;
&quot; when a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied any request during the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; on V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked canal , was hired by the transmission on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who took live the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in police officers . &quot;
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezuel@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage about the current events in the country always further complicated . &quot;

Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina for the rights of children and collects testimony from other cri@@ adi@@ ta who were just how they were victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report by Cur@@ tains , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ elas , Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , exp@@ ir@@ ky schools &quot; ) , edited and released by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she was not working together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her university degree at the University she returned once again in the house , and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one has become of something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , one referred to in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to school . &quot;
&quot; business is quite simple : a big family with little money transm@@ its her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange receives the child food , education and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; but what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victim to abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , this practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimony , researched and p@@ ran@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; she tried to mention things in the name , because the feeling of thank@@ fulness that is vacc@@ inated with cri@@ mp &apos;s cri@@ mp is guaranteed in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand it is the family that her daughter is in faith , that they will conclude their training to improve their position in society and make something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes the girl in himself and justify their exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training , and perhaps even star@@ ve . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ led , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never find out of it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the so far unknown phenomenon was made in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina arrived in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº hospital , her body showed traces of violent beats . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military ruling Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official chair .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with only 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ised that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen company &apos;s practice of cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be no further Carolina .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded a rapid investigation in the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes before judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be prophes@@ y if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go on trial . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; cri@@ adi@@ ta are not only exploited for workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ si , who worked in her father to sign up , and her father lost his work . &quot;
their brothers now had to go and started working on the road or on the market sweets to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that she was still time for learning .
it was up at 5 p.m. every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , they clean@@ se the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
when the school was at an end she went back home and had time to learn .
&quot; the more they finished with learning , the more spare time it had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says , she had never had to go hungry , but was also not in@@ definitely eating . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the library of the landlord as eating from the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a Liber@@ al Party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ e@@ ner , which was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some end of the house@@ keeper of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and editorial from opposition newspapers like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince her to give her faith to the official media reports about the regime of the dict@@ ator .
&quot; he held her for intelligent , but signed not with her . &quot; the landlord had someone who heard , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they allowed me not often to visit my family , because they were the opinion that I would like to learn there bad habit . &quot; that means that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of the Guaran@@ i , to return home their native Re@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the formation , which they had enabled them to lose again , explained them . &quot;
&quot; it was quite clear , however , that she had paid for everything they had paid by them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated discrimin@@ ated . &quot; one thing about which almost never spoken , are bullying and the ra@@ ils that cri@@ mp are exposed to them when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to go home . I had no friends in the school or the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
society condem@@ ns the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group in which you can display vac@@ ancies for cleaning personnel and child Girl in Paraguay . &quot;

hello ! I am looking for a little fellow companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please contact you .
start from Monday when possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ ke &quot; and a lot of comments .
a woman from the village of Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a big @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , which also came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; a girl from the inland , that would like to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the op@@ tic display in the display once more :
&quot; dear girl@@ friends , I have found a . I look , if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the business was completed .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , Â¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do ? &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long still ? ) , a collection of testimonies , former cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes or@@ ti@@ z , writes : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to create systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( an economic system ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores who received the Con@@ qu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores in which the Spanish conqu@@ ist@@ ad@@ ores in Paraguay were subjected to Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ers and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination . therefore , it is not ready to justify that many girls and boys will go into a system of slavery in which they become easy victim to abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
regul@@ arity writes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed a draft law to &quot; rules &quot; regulations regarding use and utility of social networks .
&quot; when he is accepted by the Parliament , the beneficiaries and users need to register social media in Egypt at a governmental authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up to give citizens an permission to give up social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adopting the law , beneficiaries and users have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is failed to do so , this could bring a penalty up to six months in prison or a fin@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the draft law that consists of six par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as a &quot; any application , which is running via the internet and used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ ot@@ ach@@ ings and text . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how the law will be enforced when the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities should raise the user &apos;s benefits and users are not able to register , given the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ ents and Pat@@ rons of the Legisl@@ ative Association , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocked . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to set a fire@@ wall on a national level on the national level , due to which it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not known so far that such plans exist . &quot;
experts and experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; executive research institutes &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I have no doubt about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that the same way they can control physical public and private spaces and also control it online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , this means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens that apply for permission or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to supply them to a judicial process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed during the legis@@ lature and the Constitutional Court before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft is consistent with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no sof@@ tening Nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Par@@ liam@@ ents Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy founded a legislative power against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long sentence for those intended to be found guilty to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the northeast of Iraq , the Tiersch@@ Ã¼tz@@ erin Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq work to protect the gh@@ o@@ cious Persian leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , who run through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and the frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are still less prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; how R@@ aza shows up in the video , &quot; &quot; The Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ ory in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem , also depends on that a large predat@@ ory is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually in the free wilderness is low and goes against zero . when the team in the video shows that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country , which does not only exist from war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in field studies on wild@@ ly living animals and in education programmes for six years .
it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protective zones for wildlife in the region of Kurdistan has been set up .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily newspaper Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced the progress made for the north @-@ east Japanese daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o who were affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which lies in the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . the pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ tish pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan @-@ East , which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring @-@ PrÃ©@@ architec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture had a nuclear accident , which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
&quot; the Special Report of Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years after that , in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and pol@@ l results of the person concerned themselves .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts ( should be known , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei Mili@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures was recorded at Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima is en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , one still makes every effort to reloc@@ ate six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated of accommodation @-@ accommodation ( in the heart rate , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people saw to live in Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ wald . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such pers@@ istence . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was successful in emergency shel@@ ters . over 75 per cent of the evac@@ uation of the Ev@@ acu@@ ated in 2011 was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is here at 34 percent . &quot;
the state of works and daily life in the three affected pre@@ fec@@ tures .
&quot; to determine how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by the mis@@ fortune until December 2016 , which constitutes nearly 98 percent of the schools of three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fisheries rates in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now back in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima up only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y @-@ deaths have resum@@ ed their operation . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have seen large @-@ scale agricultural land in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed agricultural land of Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism was still reco@@ vering again , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same stand , as before the evil . Fu@@ kus@@ hima however can only show 75 percent here . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it became more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to find an overall picture , the newspaper introduced numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their rebellion has changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in its introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surve@@ yed that are still not enough in terms of cat@@ astrop@@ hic prevention . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
&quot; in her edition for the anniversary of the earthquake , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention to the situation of ev@@ acu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had not only had to experience the enormous earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disaster prepar@@ edness , nuclear disaster caused in Japan to each other . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , almost 63 000 people in areas outside the pre@@ fecture have been moved . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23 000 people had been res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima off their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster prepar@@ edness areas most of the evac@@ uation centers , older than 50 years old . they have to compete in proper homes as well as efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if one encounters people from other countries , who speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudices , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is still very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat themes which often get less attention when they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the common similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time that she worked with people from all over the world ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered in the intensive care unit : last Friday he had taken him a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide participated millions of demonstrators in a protest against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva who studied social sciences at the Bundes@@ univers@@ itÃ¤t Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors run him on this Saturday and have now moved him into a artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus within a few days rapidly spread in Brazil .
&quot; on the pictures also the face of the police officers , to recognize that with a stroke attack . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police announced in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of the active ministry . &quot;
pictures show the police officers like he in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers would fall down by a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care centre , his face would be six months long on TV and the whole oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , distributed by Lu@@ iz da Luz recorded video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus was attacked by the police officers and several param@@ edic shortly thereafter . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from a different perspective is also filmed in social networks . &quot;
in the shown clip you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who live in another federal state , Internet users have now retired 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ orian Re@@ ais ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

on Facebook calls Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ ar Irish was killed by his father because he joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . now we have attacked the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira because he has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an that has struck him with a stroke .
police officers
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only State in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators in the past Friday .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen sat at the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstrators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber @-@ stories and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police with speaker to give up violence against prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media announces stre@@ aks , by focusing on another , unexpected protagonist : a window @-@ off . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported specifically about a broken glass window in order to make a photo of the front pages illustr@@ ative .
&quot; by contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set of fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window board than over the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
you must also recognize that if you are strictly against any form of state damage .
&quot; here also , the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; is an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are given by headlines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confron@@ ting the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages in Cuba from the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alisation of Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso almost hundreds of sugar mills included in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the People &apos;s Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i , who is located in the western Cub@@ an province May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill , regardless of that there is no note@@ worthy sugar @-@ harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were placed in the sugar mills .
&quot; after the earth , the sugar industry was silent in the region , and the factory lost out@@ wards and after its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ olds was left of steel and concrete . &quot;
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to find themselves new .
some are rare the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which still gr@@ ind . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who is up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar industry is not rob@@ bed of his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region su@@ ro@@ hr@@ factories , who are back in operation after long in@@ active time , because they were received . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene recalls that exactly belongs to that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al I would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar industry was opposed to the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1.6 million tons of sugar , less than 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for alarm for a few decades ago , but poor harv@@ ests are already no news . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway sti@@ ff of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar mills were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were in@@ portable to the country . &quot;
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories that the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they just left the factories to produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the moti@@ fs that led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 through 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; &quot; economic perspectives &quot; &quot; of the OECD and the FAO , the economic and nutritional organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe @-@ export would boost roughly 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the day &apos;s day will come into history with certainty that were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring started in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the down@@ turn came from a total of 98 sugar mills , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane Greg@@ ory Greg@@ ory Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene says how he is known as a soldier , over the closing of the factory , the word he is most repeated , &apos; fraud . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order that the place is maintained , they set up a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters started to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially recorded documents that would be removed only in terms of parts , which would be removed , the addres@@ see and the date differ@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; everyone was signed by Ul@@ timo Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could be th@@ read@@ ed every discharge . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the nursing factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another complex , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved with his will in the lac@@ tation of the factory , in which construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled up one of his 31 labour @-@ years . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers has been removed .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives for working places and services were generated in the con@@ gregations in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , who saw President in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed no longer in operation , whose factories have been running well for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar mills
since 2004 sugar cane is extracted only high by the elections .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the popular Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , that many things changed , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to ab@@ ort them , they also listened to paved the road , this will also be disadvantaged also other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy have had to look up with other factories . &quot;
they have been to spare parts .
without future perspectives at one time a lot of young people left the region .
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility is still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
nine of the old soldiers bring up a rat of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , does not betra@@ y the lies , which one told him not . &quot;
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes with 65 years in pensions , not because it is lacking in strength , but because it is bitter . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were led by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities , and then with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing the young participants in talks like &quot; cultural identity , language , dispute , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever they come to mind . &quot;
&quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors . &quot;
&quot; the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &quot; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the territory of the kit@@ ebo@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the Highway of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely ignored .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video player to convey , how important to preserve traditional customs and habits despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not able to master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved here got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop group , who gave them a St@@ rop@@ he in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in an ins@@ cription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German . &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one could ever be interested in me
but I try to go on earth my days on earth
that is the day when you get our scre@@ am
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go by way of our youth
&quot; thus , they can do what they determined the creator . &quot;
&quot; in the commentary , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also adds a post and adds the St@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ manuscript ( which is published on his blog yet ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan they can be seen before almost every restaurant sculp@@ tural dishes .
&quot; to show potential customers what exactly are on the menu , will be shown close to the entrance sho@@ ok to san@@ u ( in the focus of &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the courts &quot; ) of each food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers see these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry dedicated to manufacturing these plastic courts .
in the to@@ ki@@ oter district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi there are a variety of these small companies that produce just those sculp@@ tural dishes that the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic meals are so usually they are not even more noticeable . a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos that this unusual Tw@@ ist with the sho@@ ok to sandy . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic @-@ fed mobile @-@ handed , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ ten collection objects , as in this case , cooling unit mag@@ ine : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ cu@@ ing cooling cabinet magne@@ ts for a new exhibition at Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) turned into a mobile @-@ handed over . &quot;
for this triple bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
also this part we have created for the exhibition at the railway station Tokyo .
and here is an apple that retains your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see like an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing crossing into the com@@ ic .
&quot; some cell @-@ handed and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ gens is used , a popular t@@ opping , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter a few users had their doubts about :
&quot; if there is someone who would say , &quot; wow , cool , now I can dis@@ sect my mobile phone with salmon . &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic carrier can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members . &quot;
our newest cell @-@ handed over has the shape of mel@@ lowed ice cream .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and handles of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more sk@@ ur@@ rile plastic meals can be seen at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter from the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . such as sho@@ ok san@@ to@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports at home and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the narro@@ wn@@ st and ge@@ ars regularly dive in statistics . however , they do not reflect the scale of the human tragedy which this struggle brings with itself . &quot;
&quot; the reporting about drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a @-@ cart@@ el , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the dream or the con@@ gregations you have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone refund in the hundreds of secret tombs , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners who might never heal their wounds . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news site Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the drug trafficking live &quot; ) , &quot; which aims to give a voice and stories about people who were in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime can not only be afraid of our lives .
the impact is much more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole churches have to drive many kilometers to buy something like milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
&quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bo@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; ) tells you exactly these stories . &quot;
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is married every weekend tombs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father on only one day , and lost their four si@@ blings , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed to us , to go and look to graves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
my mother is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you stand to the insurance of my father , but this does not pay them out , because they require a dying period . &quot;
where are we going to get it ? &quot;
editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we do not only have to show the faces of those who are worried . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader from Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the federal state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with illness and sensation journ@@ alistic on a number of years now .
I come by newspaper every day and I see the cover pages with images that actually only come from a textbook for criminals or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one that hi@@ pped or sad . it seems like a lack of respect for the person , who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it is continuing to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin think that he is fo@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) will be when he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of offen@@ ders , if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they have caves , who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories are becoming real numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the un@@ wind of 43 students in a neighbor can therefore be justified that they were &quot; asc@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; I think they try to speak , that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ red and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; four months black@@ mail in the main town district : as a family with threats dropped off . in this , she describes how the armed criminal month was paid for month money by their business , until they end not only the business , but also demol@@ ished their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; pain on it never ends , the trau@@ ma remains , the anxiety will come back high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed and phone numbers too .
we only contact ourselves if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are away , the better . &quot;
it included its report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to de@@ duce you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to we@@ eping . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of violence posted .
in the introduction he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missed woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which is with him . this is his name for preparing the vial of water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for whom whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , who was shot by armed men out of a passing driving car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
&quot; 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world , due to the number of mur@@ ders , according to the number of citizens for public security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day . &quot;
these are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who have organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories still live on the face of new headlines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ co@@ data project has launched its objective to present the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trading , which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this entry and the pages to which he is linked , include images , on which violence is shown . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to elev@@ ate a rum@@ or , or a for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; but how is the year after something emerged ? content in social media , no matter whether it is true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to use trage@@ dies which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
this false copy of image and event - &apos; false description &apos; or &apos; wrong context &apos; in terminology from Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures on messages .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank @-@ car cross the village of San@@ ge in the east of DR Congo , ki@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came about life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa was second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths of stroke , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tra@@ gically fell to the sacrifice of the petrol trucks .
&quot; administration representatives described a fire ball , the d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ador@@ ned homes including a movie near , which was full of people who to@@ wed the football world championship . &quot;
houses were disper@@ sed and res@@ oh@@ ed cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned to the unknown .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur @-@ user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015.@@ multiple photos of the incident form the gray scene of that day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of stolen bodies , which are up on the ground while people watch them . &quot;
but here history is not its end .
&quot; over the years , the same photo has been planted several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and mistak@@ enly did not write to real trage@@ dies in particular on events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote island of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically from atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and stores were burned down and cor@@ pse lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained back to count p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been sc@@ anned , shot or burned . &quot;
only based on satellite images the follow @-@ up could be pic@@ tured .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army @-@ based point in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to win ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here , the image from the DR Congo appear again , as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of mis@@ ten@@ ders ; Africa check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all of these cases , the image was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ aging . &quot;
yet another step further bring personal comments such as this example from DR Congo with sources of mass media in connection to supply arguments .
the picture from San@@ ge joined in Myanmar with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash , published by the United Nations those who were able to flee , rape and several deaths , some through combustion . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following inscri@@ ptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an aci@@ an @-@ Arab news page , which was f@@ ath@@ omed in 2012 , the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ one being said , monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to find this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that AF@@ P called AF@@ P as their source , were also mistak@@ enly wrote this statement , but did not have the image taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these wrong coupling range up to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; reverse picture &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can be crossed . &quot;
a revers@@ ed picture search with the search@@ engine Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed @-@ mask of private pages , platforms social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed false reports , united , have tried others to disp@@ ose the counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have created examples for the abu@@ sive use and linked them to the respective countries , based on which side they were published . therefore , we want to be more visible than through the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also associated with each other ) , several examples of dis@@ miss@@ al use may come . &quot;
here some cases that can now be played completely completely ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country @-@ examples from false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange lands indicate sides or servers , over the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ si@@ ds are still available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples , the according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also a fake examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; in this post , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not only the wrong news , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria , as well as further questions about the intention of the persons and the weak@@ ened trage@@ dies ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;

&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo was divided from the DR Congo as an evidence of the bombing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in the public discussion . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of dis@@ miss@@ al use of the image from DR Congo , with one b@@ we@@ et which expresses sympathy across the Nig@@ erian massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger who are pro@@ secuted , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pro@@ secuted , since the photos were mis@@ used . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in Myanmar , the Government of Myanmar released a right position on what they agreed as &quot; inten@@ tionally dark news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in a attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this reef position , which is only released in English , also contains references to counterf@@ eit images of rum@@ ors who operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to indicate that Muslim Buddh@@ ists kill and circul@@ ate ( which is often prevalent by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this mail directed to the members of the Russian @-@ Orthodox Church , clearly demonstrates that the image of DR Congo does not reveal the Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 &quot;
this message page claiming that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein &apos;s 2012 was given that monks and politicians have been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story to the picture of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still present in it .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 about students who were killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by now deleted , the Catholic near An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly stated that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ hadi@@ stic attack . &quot;
&quot; as the picture later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ er@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world is asleep ) . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities were of these events , which occurred in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was we@@ ather@@ ed as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ret@@ et@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it , were raised in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting forms compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message posted by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre was in circulation , and translated it in discussion like this here in Vietnamese , and explained it to counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; from the embassy in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are more confirmed examples of faul@@ ty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , however , are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time stamp exist on the web@@ cra@@ w@@ ler and isolated box they have image names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original fun of 2010 , the image may ultimately contain a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
&quot; there are two strong themes , or frames ( frames ) that undergo these post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to bigger discussions of the silence in the context of the mut@@ ations of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the sub@@ mer@@ ging of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
&quot; wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth examining how pictures are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers cannot give these images any longer faith . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who have inci@@ dental to share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
suggests that mood of mis@@ guided and mis@@ information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and narro@@ wed it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of rolled pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that the rejection of images of a ref@@ usal comes to recognize the tragedy . sometimes , these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that non@@ violent images reader and audience is des@@ ensi@@ tive and giving them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss for@@ bi@@ ous representations in the news media , fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . &quot; you will have to thoroughly think about situation where a picture suggests something suggests , which actually can also be solved by the context or completely mis@@ cell@@ an@@ tic species . &quot;
&quot; however , an examination of false subsidies should also be considered as internationally they can be . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo of Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. D@@ t. insur@@ plac@@ eable ) makes every effort to give voice enthusiastic a selection of words from all over the world , who are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; such words are available in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these uns@@ ur@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ ce@@ de ) and others that are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ m@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to each attempt of simple translation .
&quot; one word or expression is not enough , therefore a full explanation and sometimes something context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have already been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist is of &quot; &quot; trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ illa , language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - married to your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your recent years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil as :
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel after you are aware of cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they compens@@ ate other cultures , revealing other forms of thought and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of this &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite sw@@ ings here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst fle@@ ut@@ ters of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and Er@@ dr@@ ut@@ ary catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which usually works at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya entered in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; after an opinion of the disaster of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slaughter . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) , and around 100 000 people were brought at 30@@ 4 safe places . &quot;
&quot; the rainf@@ alls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ic proportions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the disaster disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water springs of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ ants and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the den@@ gue crisis , warning Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was standing in the flood , water stood up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of yesterday &apos;s flo@@ wed water he@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has five planes available for rescue operations , and another five are made for transport of emergency supplies for the residents made in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and start @-@ ups have explained to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ar in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high @-@ water conditions and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue operations for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry foods and life @-@ necessary goods for high @-@ water victims -
we are now in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f App Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) ask for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ enz@@ entrum is informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the catastrophe of the Tro@@ pen@@ crash Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed its users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and dro@@ wned persons . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , get residents in need in need and provide help with help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lan@@ kan is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;
Muslims that you cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of the Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
use Ap@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor in and love girlfriend .
&quot; I trusted her my four year old daughter , she trusted me their children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next row we are preparing the rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ gar@@ men and men , some holding the iconic picture of a woman with head scar@@ f high , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ id slo@@ gans against Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend look at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar who know it - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; that has built up in their conception . &quot;
they Muslim me .
there are worldwide 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind of art . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer in our collective imagination is so well designed so as soon as Muslims , who like I can not fit in there . &quot;
to be emp@@ ti@@ zed
I am not alone with that .
&quot; this is even happened to the poet , whose poetry is selling in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what pictures do you think of a sense when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox and schol@@ ar and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was removed , just as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists of the induc@@ tive images of Muslims living in Western books for centuries .
&quot; this loos@@ ening picture is determined by the dark man who should be afraid and the exotic woman , which you should save . &quot;
the groundbreaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid destroyed the story behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also rise further today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood supporters will continue to support them . &quot;
&quot; I worked for three years in the news industry for three years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty Nar@@ r@@ ative of our News@@ springs are dominant . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the USA could not even choose their first female presidential election . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ scar@@ ed into public buildings and expose their entire body to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exer@@ ts his &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; to the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this powerful fo@@ acy weak@@ ens Muslim women that lead movements for change .
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken on the American soil of Afri@@ cans , who had been here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er @-@ Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ violence attacks and can@@ als . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell it is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
among the 1,7 billion are part of the chain
in the news industry we do more than just stories to tell which are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative who help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to show where seven million Muslims present in the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
over a third of the Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my native parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan was new to the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were not f@@ aded Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now inevitable - Bel@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t tell por@@ k food , I say - instead of fet@@ ching my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ crafted pocket records that all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I joke , we do not carry all the flas@@ cor@@ es with us . &quot;
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current volume of a well @-@ known Islam@@ ism machine with w@@ ders , thinking tanks and experts for counterf@@ eit information that is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell it , it consists of Islam@@ ism in more than just a stranger who has signed the head to@@ wel . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling card of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;
scre@@ enshot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ ism in its most ugly forms is attacking our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it is attacking our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and diverse that it is impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;
the author in 1986 on a photo of her children &apos;s nursery .
use approved .
I want to explain that .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a Mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a Pres@@ by@@ ter@@ i@@ an Church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : believe , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ cal faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbor in the Brand@@ ung , see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the all@@ ot@@ al ritual with my daughter , if I am ashamed of them in my arms and her the Arab verses into the protection of the Quran and the Q@@ ul@@ s are called . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my mus@@ li@@ cal faith is possibly not always visible , but my Muslim adherence is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins a I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the picture of my Grand@@ mother &apos;s mother@@ ly part with her sisters , as she has decades to win a contest of the art of flowers in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I will see in this moment , if I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings ; and one basket with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
to be Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they told me if I have a bad day .
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she has brought to me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people , that - over centuries - by a &quot; Empire &quot; was established , which has founded a company with the name Ven@@ erable British East @-@ dien company , it has a deep meaning , God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my native grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of India he was writing books about the modern Islam and the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan does not f@@ ences around his family in India , he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who have been aff@@ licted millions of Kurds and Palestinians , as with my grandfather , from colon@@ ists who have shared the Muslim world as at stake risk . &quot;
&quot; at least , Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have to coloni@@ ze up to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was rejected a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an indi@@ vi@@ ous sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous , &quot; as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there was planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

&quot; to my Muslim tribe of the 1,7 billion people belong deeply into our unforgettable experience ; our un@@ conce@@ aled history . &quot;
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , distributed in Iraq , to chase mass destruction of weapons that were not existent . &quot;
it means to know that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the suicide @-@ rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means to know that when a tragedy comes home to the U.S. and the susp@@ ects a Muslim name , the history of four times is reported more than a history with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four thousand years ago was the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , of a liber@@ ated black slaves called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago a African Islam@@ ists called Bil@@ ali Muhammad ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I felt , as humans over@@ crowded airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an . &quot;
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , an Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist means , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple bonds , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billions holds more possibilities than a magic cub@@ es , but is represented in the reduced van@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to make me care of my child and all Muslim children , well knowing that powerful and privileged people are building on this van@@ ity structural Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural Islam@@ ism is to the Muslim registr@@ ations which began with President Bush and were extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in g@@ ate@@ ways .
&quot; it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries , which are bombar@@ ded . &quot;
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list that largely takes Arabs and Muslims into the Visi@@ er .
these are the wars we perform and the bombs we have on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those who do not tell us , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at North@@ western University showed a scientifically useless picture and beg@@ ging them , groups on a scale of 1 to 100 as regards evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the sligh@@ test score .
the con@@ vers@@ ations we need to lead
&quot; we are too deep dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints , which we de@@ duce in our news editorial actions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which is trying to capture our frequently with binary identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ muscle ; the viral video about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ elo Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all of this makes me hope . &quot;
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to demonstrate the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of muscular American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am worried about this difficult global point , in which we are . &quot;
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for the conspir@@ ative theore@@ ti@@ cians , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ entially because they have Muslims led to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , by having created the &quot; other &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; a few years previously , it had not been given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of as I was as old now , but that made me today to an un@@ found Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things that I left here as a bread@@ crum@@ ble track in my speech .
&quot; things that might ar@@ ouses memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our humanity constitutes , may be a story , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley find con@@ vers@@ ations within the frame of the 8th annual conference on Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the other &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militarism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of the Islamic Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell it here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where but Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people de@@ capit@@ ated by creating the &quot; others &quot; in the public idea , four decades even science of Stan@@ ford was . &quot;
&quot; we must make ourselves un@@ convenient questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to solidi@@ fy the &quot; others &quot; ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , as he had already bombar@@ ded us a new future in which we have already bombar@@ ded countries and &quot; &quot; to other made &quot; people , &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tell stories , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the creators of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ brid@@ geable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been conducted in 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed to the children there . &quot;
the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the man@@ nequ@@ ins of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of it . &quot;
&quot; while listening more often , it is often connected to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to the listening , to feel at ease . &quot;
in this format stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English .
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their representation will allow the listening to it . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the narr@@ atives typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after he explains the meaning of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language ? &quot; &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
you have been with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities have taken place , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who inspired by the project can be in contact with T@@ LS , in order to organise their own destiny . &quot;
Puerto Rico is calling from the USA to re@@ construct the sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , participating in 72 million US dollars , took part in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . the march began with the pu@@ ert@@ al Capit@@ ol , the Government building of the capital , and ran until the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the Old Town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the group called &quot; &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; &quot; ( citizenship for the Neur@@ ck of the debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical Church of Puerto Ri@@ cos . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the inter@@ viewer of the new debt of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demands that politicians , sailors and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial review and a committee committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions , corresponding remuner@@ ation in favour of the economy . &quot;
we will be pressed and sup@@ pressed .
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt , which is not their . &quot;
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with decl@@ ining pensions .
we demand immediate measures .
the island - not in the territory of the integrated territory of the US - is suffering from a serious financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; is propos@@ ing a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party membership with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis in Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of state infrastructure .
&quot; from the outside , measures imposed without the participation and conviction of the citizens danger , will be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :
prot@@ esters prepare themselves on the march .

&quot; the sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian web developers Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives are continuing the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is organised in Berlin , dedicated to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , business@@ man named &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; ready books within three to five days , las@@ en excerpts from the book cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; the book that was released last year and is available here roy@@ alty , contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book wishes to discuss how movements are built for freedom knowledge and what the real costs are to be associated with .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for freedom knowledge have side to look to the fog that surrounds our news fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and sophisticated Internet Volun@@ te@@ ers who is de@@ tained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was crossed out from the directory of the A@@ dra @-@ prison , where he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about its current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory reminder of his book with the title of collective memory gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how bas@@ ing pays a high price for his involvement in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here tonight ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary convic@@ tions ?
the Web@@ developers for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in charge of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police bases are based on a &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; command of the Military Tribunal from its cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported to be contacted by persons on November 12th , 2015 , who presented himself as in@@ sider of the Assad government and having knowledge of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role in bringing the access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and currently over the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ le , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ han &apos;s cultural prototypes fores@@ ee more than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the crossing of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bas@@ sel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would have everything to place it , that architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strip @-@ de@@ duction into the digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a period of time , which will be invaluable to the public , as well as for scientists and artists in the future of invaluable . &quot;
&quot; yet , Bas@@ sel could not complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my entire life with it , from freedom to dream and bas@@ ins taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was in custody . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read English well , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught other incar@@ nate , to write English , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also contributed to other prisoners , as they use computer , at least theoretically , without having actually thought of them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ it ) , a promot@@ er she wrote in the years 2012 till 2015 her husband , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for one year .
&quot; she ordered the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .
book@@ case of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It is done &quot; :
&quot; it is done during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I am ens@@ lav@@ ed in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose respect in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that each of the dangers no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bonds and guardian &quot;
I forget the prison of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
I carry with passion for me
if your eyes are saying
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness .
to rep@@ ay all the moments
and about your absence to cry and smile .
I persu@@ ade myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
while
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le History is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests 2011 against the regime Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network for Human Rights ) disappeared more than 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
&quot; those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime , were tor@@ tured , or even executed . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other human beings remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption condemned director after the release of prison was back to previous posts .
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ que re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt , in which a government member returned after half of his sentence on the employment level in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from Moz@@ ambi@@ que airports , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za is between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately requested its re @-@ setting in the company , which was then also happening on 19 April . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Pro@@ secutor of the Republic , given the application , there would be no hin@@ dran@@ ce for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old posts as the company was not accomplished a discipl@@ in@@ ous procedure after his detention centre . &quot;
&quot; however , many citizens do not mean the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , shortly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ ous obj@@ ections to the res@@ eller .
&quot; however , the firm apparently circul@@ ate and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ que social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and considers the case as &quot; ref@@ usal . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence , and half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and face his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company who helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will be happy for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans and student of political sciences in Brazil says , the director has no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe in such a way that the state has already been rewarded so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality and serve the state , * he had already serving a unique opportunity to serve the state but has only served themselves on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as hand@@ ful@@ ler it has become an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money of money , and the state itself has become tired who was loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I do not know why this man was rewarded so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remember the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as a first independent president , but also as a sharp one @-@ cut and - next door - prophe@@ tical speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations , when he ins@@ ulated that &quot; an ambitious person is able to sell , also the father@@ land for its ambition , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience is that not so . he does not alter the tactics , but it does not turn away from its ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is criminal at the same time . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also canc@@ eled :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat down for 10 years and was free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company is putting him in which he money un@@ tre@@ ach@@ ute to return again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ vio Association ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12 May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ her@@ se or Sp@@ aging .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook @-@ users in Myanmar , the well known social network took their post@@ ings from the net , because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although about the origin of the word still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people ost@@ indi@@ an origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; indi@@ an . &quot; &quot;
Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; or at the same time ( in Bur@@ m@@ ical font ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network .
in recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely de@@ fle@@ dged con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that mostly used by Ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of sensory content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism , but the word in itself does not lead automatically hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed to the use of his usage . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental meanings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &apos; ( sp@@ age ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ use A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at declared the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in spiritual ways whether he knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain , made a word play . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fra@@ ge@@ word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative from Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win h@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radic@@ al@@ ists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical , before being extingu@@ ish all Po@@ sts who res@@ ign in suspicion , racism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you can write on Fac@@ ts .
&quot; what it should do instead , is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words . &quot;
&quot; for example &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar Pa@@ e &quot; ( aging ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these three @-@ minded nation@@ alists , spread the hate speech , received a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to be circumc@@ ised at the time , its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action likes to send a strong signal to everyone , that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proved that the cens@@ orship of keywords often will start a cat@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described , as Facebook began to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to notify my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to ignore the light , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of po@@ sts of people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against hate crimes against radic@@ als .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post office , the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community about advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform , but it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
cens@@ oring these words will only bring more hatred inside the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so called &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to put the fal@@ si@@ bly deleted Po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would bring them a great turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship is provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts which no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see her@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch some Indian film .
&quot; just to try out , whether Facebook contains the post office , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
&quot; says Post &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , heal then people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot used with permission .
&quot; in the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to increase their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech should be forced into social networks with violence in Myanmar in addition , especially in the territory Rak@@ h@@ ine where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands of escape . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to speak the f@@ arious hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sites under control .
&quot; but rather than simply to cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would be better to look at the context rather than code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the children &apos;s marriage
a bri@@ ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on June 9 , 2017 , the Parliament adopted unanimously a law which is supposed to ban this practice , so that the s@@ lu@@ ent age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; prior to this change of the marriage law some members of the du@@ alistic and arti@@ fic@@ tional religious communities took place in practice , and in May 2016 , the leader of the religious organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups in the country gathered , that the state did not interfere with the religious groups , as that , age , not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is an contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , to each person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children who had already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2 8 percent , and with 18 there were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical point of the country confirmed that 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online Pe@@ ti@@ tions and social media movements that were endeav@@ ored to create laws for the children &apos;s before , followed at the foot and pleasing great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du @-@ Guide for B. had no concerns , the critics of the children &apos;s before they should , are dam@@ ned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition att@@ led to tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and sometime there were doubts as if the opposition would vote to the bill &apos;s throw at all . &quot;
&quot; however , at the beginning of 2017 the draft law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of opposition and an independent , which was to be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where an easy majority of him would make him a law . &quot;
now he has to agree with the President of the country and pro@@ claim the law .
one of the sen@@ ators of the country on Facebook gave a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram has once again posted :
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s before was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and nobody decided against it . &quot;
&quot; having decided before in the Senate , the draft can now be made to the law . &quot;
the majority of the social media user was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally amended for the children &apos;s marriage .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who dressed a ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk that has conce@@ aled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it was definitely long enough to do the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excellent News ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted , &quot;
the young age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independently of the religion of religion 18 years .
&quot; the draft to amend the New Testament Law was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and were present 35 in the vote .
members who were against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s toe is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago by law no longer allowed .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # child@@ r@@ Ã´@@ le .
many thanks to all activists who have drawn him out .
congratulations .
a thank you to our MEPs .
&quot; however , a potential hook comes to the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to take court steps , should the law be passed , and he seems to trigger his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the Adv@@ oc@@ ate At@@ tor@@ ney Paris Al ra@@ wi , a de@@ fi@@ ery of the law , he said , unless Mahar@@ aj against the law , wished the most social media users , you would approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , when we hold instead of discussing the discussion so broadly , in a way that the state , our daughters guard , protect our daughters from that , would be mis@@ used , would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or continuing the standard , although there are laws that they say . &quot;

&quot; screen printing of the message , posted on Sunday early on the website of the pro@@ secutor of the district Y@@ aros@@ lav@@ l . &quot;
&quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ des with the Day of Russia - the Russian national celebrations , the h@@ ackers broke away from the district of Y@@ aros@@ lav@@ l . the h@@ ackers have left a funny message &quot; &quot; lead . &quot;

&quot; at 11.@@ 15 , the message was removed from the side - in the middle memory they remained intact . &quot;
it is # gentle
&quot; on Sunday morning , the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office shared the local news service Yar@@ News with that they were ch@@ opped . &quot;
through the mirrors of websites Turkish users can see their content on Wikipedia .
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was shown on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally distorted . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has now been the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based Encyclo@@ pedia . &quot;
day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information and to share .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series are opposed to blocking the block .
&quot; although many techniques @-@ vers@@ ed internet users used to use it , changing tools for blocking web pages ( a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , the Internet Act has been adopted since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the two most known country in the world , when it comes to massive cens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to be locked , there are several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform supports all Turkish Wikipedia sides on the de@@ centralized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus a complete cens@@ orship is difficult . &quot;
the content is not available in spite of legal ban .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the block from Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the content on de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS has also been made that this step is independent of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
however Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ v@@ ise the lock .

a Nepal@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him , never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned motives and washed colors . &quot;
the motiv@@ ating him to carry on a camera itself and try to handle the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar strives to bring him to the international stage in the age of 28 . &quot;
&quot; and his home town right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , who will draw attention to Nep@@ ali wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook as he helps him this first @-@ class position at his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I returned home straight away when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the river dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had watched it , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was standing and I immediately started to crack pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with authorities to acquire worldwide recognition for Nep@@ ali and like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not so fear@@ ful how they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep not at sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping times for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was at home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ wei@@ ghted appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ ali and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent , in order to take part in Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days lasted until he took a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;
check out below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az the Ar@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was posted here as part of a content @-@ sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women prevent women with utmost care to speak the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ oun or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should be mis@@ understood the norm in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a , and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also do not name their names , is also prevalent among men . however , they have much less justi@@ ces to fear if at all what , they should not be able to do this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ row in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , a unique club , and became thus quickly the main table of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers and advocates the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; she has been working with the help of her vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era for seven years with the help of her Vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era , on the un@@ covering of practices such as children &apos;s rat up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS Indians , and guides these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in its discussion round , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
&quot; speaking on the names of their hus@@ bands , a bread is also maintained that they maintain all conflicts and never asked questions . &quot;
Roh@@ ini thinks :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not hold this , is regarded as being deposited as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband with her name until now , when he was running at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ law , and my husband still ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh for a long time after the video was ended . &quot;
&quot; intern@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should name him from now on with his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first discussion .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; nor ever before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video project , women were trying to get the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini requested each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we can not say the name of our sp@@ ouses , but they can tell us how they want , does it mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ ak of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women never declared the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she had only ki@@ cked off all the exercise , and another chose to allow the whole bot@@ tled frustration against him and his family by floo@@ ding it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in ad@@ renalin flowing about it , with an ancient brack@@ et broken , the women , that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands with the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini , and asked what ideas she put into the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another club member chose to do it during dinner prior to the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ mother she was stub@@ born , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation ar@@ isen in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports , how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing a cin@@ der red point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ der red spot if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I listened to it to wear it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped working completely , but they think they are now in a better position , even to choose him in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the last few months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sp@@ ears and talked about things that they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also made some things , such as our identi@@ ties in our sp@@ ouses , never spoke honestly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion board we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have carried only coff@@ in since their marriage .
&quot; for most it is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ man @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt of a pants , they did not trust . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussion about the merits of their own hang@@ ers , morality combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , jewellery Roh@@ ini her own pair of cran@@ ky ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) in a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a in which they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will create it . &quot;
&quot; whether the first discussion has changed since its first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirms that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have only taken small steps so far .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then heard then again to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and are not any other family members . &quot;
only one or two say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women carry at any time Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ us@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the polish is about more freedom of movement or the own han@@ ger - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating the river .
&quot; putting each other self @-@ confidence , become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explained :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ arch .
I am there too .
but this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told others about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

&quot; for just under five days the Beatles were in the country , but this has been sufficient to leave the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; people here are quite quickly clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles , with open arms . &quot;
many well known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the Kul@@ t@@ band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; told Ry@@ u@@ i@@ chi Is@@ aka , President of the retail collection Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ Turkey Asian Review . &quot;

the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! took on a pilgrimage to London and ran onto Abbey Road .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of smooth persons for the organ@@ ist , probably for super@@ se@@ perate purposes , disturbing the police of Zam@@ be@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government called for a number of operations to stop the practitioner . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been removed .
&quot; two men were arrested , and subsequently they stood , that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used . &quot;
&quot; it give the local super@@ sti@@ tions believe that the head of a smooth man of gold un@@ old or wealth can bring , the police declared by Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia on the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time consecutive attacks on gl@@ it@@ ous men were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
&quot; another group , which is purpose for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN in the South African country to investigate a mission to investigate this practitioner .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudices . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que to Moz@@ ambi@@ que men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que are goal of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ valent police according to their latest pro@@ of@@ ed men due to their body . &quot;

in recent days three men were murdered with hair @-@ cas@@ u@@ alties in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha shared on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty , which is Moz@@ ambi@@ que : &quot;
&quot; I would like to be ashamed of E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH , in which the people would have hesit@@ ant to go on the road , and others would be ashamed of having sex against good notes , and others do not violate their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ it@@ ous for super@@ v@@ ous purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; which aim to reach its own richness . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for flawless humour did not escape . &quot;

&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after being announced at the end of June , having been delivered to hospital at the end of June for liver cancer . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after being involved in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to , which imp@@ acted the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and tells a speaker , he did not consider it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to call up calls from the international community to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and his wife , poet in Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him to treat abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely pronounced . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker declined , however , to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to provide treatment . &quot;
Norway after Norway
Norway &apos;s prime minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ da have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway in Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government was rus@@ hed to do nothing with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to resume the salmon drove to China since 2010 , since 2010 exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after sending the message , Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope for unconditional release to express and lu@@ de Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of his detention , he was not able to counter his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on July 6 , the European Parliament adopted a decision where China was asked to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and permit him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on the release of Li@@ us on June 30th : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to all limitations of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all the visits and receive , they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad , with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , insofar as it helped him with his pleasure . &quot;
&quot; spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary of the Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , announced that the message delivered the Chinese authorities to free not only Li@@ u but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US message drew an angry answer from China to himself , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign affairs that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with and un@@ answered remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to medical care of his choice , which they have received according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Mercury and Ted Cruz also introduced a decision in Congress to release the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally , so that he can embark on a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;

&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was published on July 7th and 8th at the G20 , in Hamburg . &quot;
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters reported that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex about Li@@ u could be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed to visit Hamburg . &quot;
Canada in Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um to ask China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to worry himself from his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us Mrs. , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police always monitors the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
&quot; Canada urges China to release his international human rights obligation , including freedom of expression , to true and to release the rights to the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France in France
France &apos;s foreign minister called for China in a statement on 29 June to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments which he , regardless of where , requires . furthermore , his wife and family can contact him . &quot;
&quot; though the news of France Info already reported that the French government of Li@@ u would welcome in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information whether France will eventually pick him up . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of foreign affairs in Taiwan , China called on 27 June to release Li@@ u and demonstrate a greater tolerance to those who are calling for peaceful means to reform political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese authorities at Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling class progres@@ sives , called for China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to deal with Taiwan in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed herself in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and gave him that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was rigor@@ ously punished , to a harmonious , more stable and prosperous China could have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally moved and encouraged also , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , Shan@@ mu@@ gam should be considered as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in the blo@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York , the Ministers noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapur because they are compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he ass@@ ures that Singapore should be considered as a city .
no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is it but most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; &quot; turning the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this precious country , we hear that we are not in any country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , Wh@@ ose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons mentioned by Shan@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; , &quot; given it , he appeared in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the theme , the good old suffering from the author@@ itarian mach@@ inations will be to be Democrats , leaving democrats , since they fit better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ gam given answers to its American guests regarding our press , our ju@@ dict@@ ate , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ responses ration@@ ale style .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ gam to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , for which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our more successful K Shan@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clarify this point unless it was paid high , in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the blog his comment , he points out regarding the critics that one should begin to see the whole trans@@ cript of the conference to better understand the context of statements by Shan@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city , and no country . &quot;
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; he stated why the elections in Singapore says so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he ad@@ ored Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party ? ) .
&quot; as he said , Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously has not meant in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ gam , who is acting as leaders of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - be I agreed with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is , properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review disman@@ tle the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
does Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam &quot; well@@ ed a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; as he plays an important role within the auction , the statements of Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ gam are of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the Singapore authorities make their military service , they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
whom should our Prime Minister pay back ?
what is the value of our pink human resource price ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and always has a city : &quot;
&quot; I did not say , what I said ... &quot;
this proposition seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite true . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Can@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your homeland or home country ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continued series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; &quot; I then I come from Canada . &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation , by giving personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clear position then usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans have been bo@@ oming inside anger , if they are held for Americans , but does not bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag well visible in their ru@@ cks@@ ack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans in contrast ... .
&quot; so it was already when I started traveling 20 years ago , through the world - especially Donald Tr@@ ump , in front of the march in Iraq and September 11 . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small ap@@ le blades on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
for us there is no weapons !
gender @-@ gender marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; sorry . &quot;
Canada is alleged also to be the tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not just like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends who I really appreciated . &quot;
I would not make a difference if you would like to exchange me Johnny from Dallas to another example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; however , there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first , as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be , in essence , to be enough - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but tra@@ gically an important figure of N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ son &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
if Canada really would be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders would be indeed a step forward . but the actual problem is that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has .
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing , where you can come across . &quot;
&quot; harmless , is to be in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn . &quot;
&quot; this can be a good thing , if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen to get around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go far as far as we go , to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a protagonist of the Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence to the neighbors .
&quot; we miss the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &apos; nice &apos; . our Prime Minister has made Canada almost sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop band released a music video , which the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ des that 2014 seized the power and restore the civil government despite its promise to restore the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells about which rules he makes his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was posted on Facebook up@@ loaded Video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; Der Dic@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand until a group of activists asked the public to look at this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policy , in@@ particular about how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
once again these recordings of the video relate to some of the political issues that Thailand are per@@ secuted in the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in@@ ic section 44 of the provisional constitution , which is an absolute decision @-@ in @-@ chief of the army &apos;s commander @-@ in @-@ chief decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setting change &quot; by journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are viewed as critics by the jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the implementation of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and in@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to condemn activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , monitored on the online content and those who have thrown out , the monarchy is sl@@ ander@@ ed to have criminal pro@@ secuted . &quot;
Thailand sets a strike against &quot; paraly@@ se Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty &apos;s rotation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was launched in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup in the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continue to per@@ secuted , is their decision to buy costly U boats , although security experts they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown how persons are thrown into a black supply car , before one gets into a detention camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists sit in prison , because they supposedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will face long arrest , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the band members of the band showed the Sal@@ ut out of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in Eastern Asia .

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered only very slowly in East Asia @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has passed over 20 years since the Georgian war has been officially cancelled , but his fo@@ ols are still strong in this part of the republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chi@@ ava are located in the carbon basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , de@@ preci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ers and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their houses during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases are living in the area . &quot;
such settlements are called in Ab@@ k@@ asien also gh@@ ost cities .
&quot; in the previous war there were more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people living in this area . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people had declined since 2011 , after over a decade . &quot;
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; all this is a result of war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story flo@@ cks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ sh@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is obvious . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centres , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens that served all of the community . &quot;
&quot; now , there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings . &quot;
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live around fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; K@@ hr@@ ush@@ cho@@ ka , who are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just told us it is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers to their friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration delivers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or aun@@ t g@@ alya as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ han@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; despite their oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left to leave Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Asia Minor , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina wants to assume no financial support from her daughter and ins@@ ists that she instead supports her young grand@@ son .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ thly R@@ ent are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya talks about her and other villagers to meet regularly and celebrate holidays .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
&quot; however , we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; says T@@ ante G@@ alya her to her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as conversation Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she recalls the thor@@ ns in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives , who live in the country of Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ asien the country broke out ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we want to build a house there , but this will still take a bit , &quot; &quot; explains it . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for every child .
your husband is working in the cab@@ bage .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; close to the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten once found , keep it pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; she tells that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation first , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t be afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
I remember every day how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation comes to the end , a little boy passed over to us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy hun@@ ted to him .
he plays with the ball that goes down the hill .
a group of children now follow the ball now .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones at the slo@@ wed building . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure in@@ consistency in their lives . &quot;
they do not know otherwise .

in Mexico hosts &apos; Mama Africa &apos; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 , on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and appears with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; cross the path of migrants to cross Europe or Latin America , some places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the mex@@ ican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , located on the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city center .
it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - J@@ olds of Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ er to a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bril@@ liance and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears shape .
&quot; it is called the Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become an aim for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 Dollar per night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the pre @-@ room there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - yet hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ cian migrants are coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? &quot;
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cart@@ ons . &quot;
it does not want anyone to decline .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to hospital when they are sick , they buy them medications that they can not pay , they mas@@ hed them with a bal@@ sam , inspired by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if mom is Africa a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) posi@@ tional with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ acken .
&quot; yes , yes &quot; , &quot; he answered with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very cute women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make up a first stop in South America and then moving north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other companions from Mama Africa . &quot; mom Africa is a well known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tian and Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that the Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app of Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companion companion , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; as the Brazilian economy , he has started his trip to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket according to Ti@@ ber .
I wonder if he is in contact with Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; mom Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; reply smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests often send text messages if they continued to greet them or to report her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the town a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valencia .
we recorded this winter to Valen@@ ela and his family migrants in their little house .
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus driver to numerous African migrants are to be sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar per night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are here , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valencia explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I have lived in the United States &quot; , &quot; he tells . &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was transferred to the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he had flo@@ wn in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to sup@@ press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and a well @-@ known , a single @-@ cat@@ cher , has offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and they tried to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa is all back full of guests .
in the courses we consult travelers calm their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has 20 new guests , a large majority of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone . &quot;
as a proud grandmother blows her in her album with many photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ stain@@ ed who made her a customer in , some pictures of her grand@@ kids and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sad while she puts her briefly .
&quot; Ya &apos;@@ fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter @-@ users .
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users were received in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the city of Ur@@ um@@ qi , in which it indicates the District Government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; web cleaning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in communication , the app is said to prevent the access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities will also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they , shortly after they had exchanged the app , had exchanged messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police state that the app would determine the sources and distribution paths of terrorists and follow &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block@@ age of porno@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing sides to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to control your own home network . &quot;
this app with the filtering for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ ackers could capable to manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it out . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities of the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , depres@@ sed ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit unrest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ ored and surveillance measures as well as routine devices . &quot;
&quot; the media @-@ based media output &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in the focus of the latter in China , showed photos from a Check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an the inhabitants in@@ discrimin@@ ate after that they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile aler@@ ts demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained for up to 10 days . &quot;
it is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced the people to use devices , which are intended for older people to use . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by rest technology .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( in the focus of the object , in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which prot@@ ru@@ ding that the software can lift the password of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly be a response to the instructions of the City Council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all governmental branches , authorities and the related institutions including universities and research institutes are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office while operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , issued a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , portable drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; &quot; register at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; . however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible promises , including those which refer to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything sh@@ outs after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane writes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and set you firmly on a place where all things are gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved , and a truth reveals that clearly visible , both from inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name all honor .
one who has crus@@ hed itself into a list of sentim@@ ents and ex@@ iting that does not allow any metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when you get into reality the reality and you behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performers - turn the characters into being of flesh and blood , and everything sh@@ outs after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts solve in smoke and you are aware of your existence , even when the Earth is on the axis of Un@@ hei@@ ls . you &apos;ll realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and in front of them thy grandparents , stone was built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but this wasn &apos;t enough so I &apos;m talking about &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the leader of the security service they are form@@ alized - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
he presented his power over us as eviden@@ ced even the simplest concepts we knew .
&quot; five young people were te@@ aring during a peaceful protest , like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , so that the city sh@@ attered the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; all the neighbour@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , just my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , ra@@ ining , at the wrong time , even though I have no high demands on a city that is up@@ lifting up into the arteries with government security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit , after the power supply in the quarter had to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the still@@ ness by writing several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ts through the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt courageous to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we sat down to a glorious picture that filled my expectations full . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you have liber@@ ated the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the case . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet at military security buildings . &quot;
he placed on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can go down - nothing can give you your voice , after you have sli@@ pped the whole way up to the office of the security service from the womb . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st G@@ ass@@ an was standing there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you are &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry out if we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ water @-@ filled eyes began on me .
&quot; and you &apos;re sad , what to look in the eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ ish@@ ness , van@@ ity , and perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my job than I answered : &quot; I had not thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never ceased to see you in the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not rep@@ ent a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; in a solo and his father , the same is equal to him . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed proposition is to me today in the nose .
&quot; he was subjected to a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a spiritual torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I scre@@ amed the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I do with myself .
&quot; afterwards , through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a course to the single cells . &quot;
I treat all details exactly before I cared for the room .
otherwise than otherwise they shared a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one single prisoners and put me immediately , without waiting for her permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes he felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked on an old @-@ established communication method : to strike with the fist against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my team of cent@@ er@@ ers was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ wing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was a respectable man middle age that looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive coun@@ tenance can be seen in me , and doctors are not here ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all the answers to His existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the great cells .
maybe he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insured me , they would leave him when I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; I would gladly have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to sell all these cro@@ ws , focusing on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; Allah Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it has to be about 10 am in the evening ; always around this time the cri@@ es every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black saw the color of destruction , until I saw the yellow light that presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Th@@ under &quot; , &quot; p@@ airing the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to listen .
&quot; this was the secret to protect ourselves : to protect the state of state security in front of us and prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ el@@ ective dialect - thus they played their con@@ fes@@ sions on their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is here no land ; it is a curse , which they call coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the audi@@ t@@ orium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions , giving it off : &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to close this diary and protest on demonstrations that anyway soon an end can be found . &quot;
I answered not .
I used to get used to me .
I can really no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication means .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice told me that I had to get used to myself or to get used to it , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
at punishment in all its diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic tube that probably dates from the clo@@ ak .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams fell not enough , why she exchanged the tube by a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked earlier as a trash collection , or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ isted each other to present us from their perspective , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
within a single hour I changed three of them while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and did not notice any favor by reason why he grab@@ bed as the next to an electric up@@ loaded rod .
flow flo@@ wed my entire body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , spread out on the ground , was the perfect black@@ heads . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night . &quot;
this must probably have been at midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again , and say , that was my only option . &quot;
a few hours left for me as minutes .
then the call to dawn .
&quot; the door opens and the morning opens the room &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of a given youth : &quot; &quot; my lord , my father has to worry . &quot;
&quot; be silent and gone , you will be transferred . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me to ? !
the j@@ ord@@ anic r@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance . &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends the most of his time inside , and he returns to his painting , even to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
&quot; but what one can rely on , is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover their lips . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which had been listening to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed its occupation by the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as rocky ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for the six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who is confronted with the conservative majority and questioned their old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and free speech by art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees . all these topics do not only find in his hometown Am@@ man Rel@@ ev@@ ance , but also in cities that vary from Damascus to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees itself as a man who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can feel compassion on the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not reveal it openly , he triumph@@ s a particular dis@@ incl@@ ination to the American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b doesn &apos;t believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian de@@ ple@@ dged of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think because of my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so because I am a human being , while in water , Nes@@ cafÃ© sticks in two cups . it is the holy month of Ramadan ; at this time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Law Law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal .
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking down with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in an sen@@ sing called Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the sli@@ pped warm coffee and the wa@@ iters of the k@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you have a look into the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it would be easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not end in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Action Front - in argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ trun@@ ner Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for concert forecast . &quot;
the members and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition of D@@ IMA Tah@@ b@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just said &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ kan@@ ers .
&quot; many also claim to be the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is of hazardous activ@@ ism , which constitutes the old proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la is a &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continues to stand up for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is likely not to be simply sei@@ zing rhet@@ oric , but actually a more and more clear cryst@@ all@@ ine reality in Jordan which appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards can be sur@@ passed by having his vision of the fate of Arabian wives who have pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex .
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ known woman , whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women , who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary mor@@ de &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; human Rights Watch reached its climax in the year 2016 . however , the number of honorary infrastructure reached its peak ; however , Jordan is still lacking to have the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence have become an adequate way of supporting . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the dis@@ ruption of the year 1954 women , who are exposed to risk of internal violence , &quot; at an in@@ definite time in prison , &quot; and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman shall not happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music also enjoys great popularity , and is well @-@ known , not to withdraw from themes that were long as tab@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b will dispute that his work is political , however , that he puts his music , the full explicit references to sexuality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , Mann . &quot;
&quot; my policy was conf@@ essed , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are at the core of political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song with the title &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get , in his words , &quot; that is what you want &quot; - is it belief or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on gender equality have been greatly cens@@ ored by the LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ ian Online@@ program Ro@@ ya , to later notice that his comments were taken from the context , distorted and being cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b open for the arab@@ ic T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory today thanks to its homo@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who later once again work on behalf of the cali@@ bre , was openly able to write homo@@ sexuality in the eighth century , why cannot Jord@@ an@@ ier not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the deputy Intelligence service took several former members of government members and members of the Mag@@ er@@ association , with the ration@@ ale , they expressed themselves critical about the problems with the deeply rooted in the country with the deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; according to what is the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to what is the tip of the ic@@ eberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a continual giving and taking . Jordan has dist@@ res@@ isted Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks slow , depres@@ sions and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the j@@ ord@@ an society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is dre@@ aming , like millions of other Arabs also , from an Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreamed not only about his work until Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is suffering from music , art and literature on real and basic openness - and not by bombs , parti@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ent democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue , and therefore also resist resistance . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the biggest festivals in Japan .
these big and extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is thought that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory states that the strongh@@ olds , drums and dancing over more than one thousand years were inv@@ aded in order to force the indigenous people of the region to force the indigenous people of the region . &quot;
we are at the Fo@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to sn@@ ap a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a Community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two strongh@@ olds are just to be seen .
&quot; yet for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only thing - and a breathtaking way to spend its summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care as important as in this history , because they help to hold the Peruvian youth from the crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street predat@@ ors and illegal drugs is daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region may not feel safe .
Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , who can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , even has inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ styles of &quot; &quot; Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os &quot; &quot; held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there you can compete against each other , to show who you can create the ec@@ centric le@@ looks like you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions there are on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people to get their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools , and instead of poor ratings to get education in the hair@@ dressing room that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities have seen dozens of young people , that they can take a job , which is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special educational workshops before the beginning of March and reported about some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only Fach@@ hoch@@ schule in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ rilla warfare

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution of &quot; &quot; love message to guer@@ ri@@ descent &quot; , &quot; which has published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who have spread out , affection ? &quot;
&quot; this question went out to the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young Art and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young @-@ Youth Foundation , and inspired her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ ver@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters of reconciliation ) , the young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , her country venue was a historic event and they wanted to contribute her part : after years of negotiation , the Colom@@ bian government signed a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; International was devoted to the sig@@ nat@@ ing of the peace treaty than so significant , that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; however , in front of the Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists , there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who had been exposed to illegal camps for many years , had been exposed to war rhet@@ or@@ rhet@@ oric and carried out around the clock by the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases , deeply towards guer@@ rilla war , must now take in its ranks and support them while building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans join together and had to help with the integration process .
and this is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people wrote letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society .
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla warfare , which are to be handed over to personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for aton@@ ement was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there &apos;s Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the possibility to speak shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we love the people who we love , am writing thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told everyone to share his love with people this year , which was most urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC to write their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I would never thought that someone would have given me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region .
&quot; a group of 40 students at the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , of the Foundation of Bogot@@ kind re@@ ists in the camp to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC agreed on , as they did earlier to counter the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of women from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between , &quot; &quot; told the political sciences Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the governor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had handed down the letters , a former fighter led me through the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ rilla warfare live ) , I saw an guer@@ rilla war that wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to take up , because beside him on the bed was an M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the bush . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I spoke to him nevertheless , and asked , &quot; &quot; hello , what do they say ? &quot; &quot; I answered , &quot; &quot; I answered a letter , whom someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answering my tears away over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I missed him quite firmly and sat down beside the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never expected anything else from life to war . the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; &quot; I never thought that someone would have given me for my fault . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society out there , who are waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
&quot; up to now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; in the pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion board . &quot;
the students had all grown up as a war and the F@@ ARC already signed in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views about the peace process : &quot; many years we have experienced how the social injustice has been on the whole of the Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never heard heard before and had no voting right , and to recognize that people that I have often seen as monsters and had even hate them , even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander &apos;s camp in Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
Kolum@@ bi@@ an@@ ists was made white that after the dra@@ in@@ age peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as it exists inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest against their rights , and that is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we call all the defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong - above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifice , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last few months on the persecution of the men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat that , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ ome above the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not first formed by night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans @-@ sexual wife from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international headlines several months ago , after reports have been published , which took the to@@ wing , torture and killing que@@ er men in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men , and they were in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a Monster to the World &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; even since her childhood , she felt that she was in reality a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was re@@ growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ h had experienced by the gender equality , the hunt was opened to Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear for their lives , she moved the last analysis to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer assistant in a human rights organisation .
one day was told me that someone took my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ wife that tasted in difficulties . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; as I tried to help her , he made a friend of whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , which can eliminate these shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made by the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just doing a bunch of shopping from my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family yet ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I just know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost awareness and a@@ woke last analysis in the hospital again .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to scre@@ am .
the man was flying .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two sampling dies in my right bron@@ chi@@ ken .
OC Media : in what hospitals have you been laid - in the men or women of women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , there is my male name dr@@ on ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
therefore I am very grateful .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time in his office , I got to do it with fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ au@@ kas@@ y name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
&quot; to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they asked absurd demands : some told me , I need it to prove that I had not changed in the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have KÃ¶r@@ b@@ chen@@ size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke once my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that is not just your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot stir you , because you are a dev@@ out woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a stri@@ ck around the neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbours came and they saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window a car has a dark@@ ened window of window and a numer@@ ical plate with a height of 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something lazy . &quot;
my husband &apos;s boy@@ friends trans@@ duc@@ ted the Num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was pro@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you fly ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for safety reasons , I do not want to reveal their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without writing without me , without notice , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rub@@ b@@ ish .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think about , you would be in security , just because you have left the land ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and sisters .
&quot; but we do not talk about the gender equality , but this is a tab@@ ular theme . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ hen@@ ian elements are still in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier I can &apos;t overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt them . &quot;
when we chat with camera I actually give effort to look like the person that she reminds himself of her past - thus to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for the needed information I needed about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who have saved one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan not people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock out a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; in order that I mean , they probably invite the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are even now also gay men in these secret prisons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there was just not so many .
&quot; if , then above all those who have no rich relatives , or who were dropped by their relatives were dropped to Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are being held there , so that they can present them later than terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , you will show off their bodies on TV and claim , they would have attacked either a village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people have not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged into itself . &quot;
OC Media : is this only one presum@@ ption or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I quote someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun in a half and a half months .
&quot; he says that many people disappeared in this prison , after their beard had grown . &quot;
there was nothing new about them since .
they simply took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; but until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports yet . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
&quot; why otherwise , one would not have allowed these people to shave ? &quot;
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair for a long time .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I believe that in 2003 I was already known quite Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it now . &quot;
&quot; Russia has originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; &quot; but in the end it has finally thrown back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this under the sh@@ aria law possible ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were at@@ oned ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube for jeans and short loops . &quot;
the security of the Sh@@ aria has never bent to me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny , there was a place where every night , especially at weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Ch@@ echn@@ ya language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; do not complain about the mis@@ fortune of another .
&quot; it often says to children , if they make things funny about sick . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed before you , because they believed you are sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never hun@@ ted me before never hun@@ ted and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace hold time ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row stood on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak on mor@@ als . &quot;
&quot; he did not speak about us , but primarily on the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel like the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who previously sm@@ iled and sm@@ iled , viewed you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in the period I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel like the situation in the Republic was rising steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you go now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , mer@@ ges , I gr@@ asp@@ ed them to hospital and help them to get Essen@@ tial modes . &quot;
I have not long c@@ ents for it .
I discovered these people themselves when I dis@@ sect the sanctuary .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear one mistake ?
Sab@@ rina : this is silly .
&quot; this is the nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; that is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth , that there are no b@@ umps with them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ ans have those who have the Kab@@ ard@@ iner which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet , they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I am from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
I meet here so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , going into the mosque and during the Ramadan , live together with men . &quot;
&quot; you know many think of transi@@ tions to men , the men love , and they believe that you are moving his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a failure . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate , different ways of life . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body . &quot;
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I will be personally personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in self @-@ mor@@ ants in the impover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in self @-@ mor@@ ants . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .

&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , the dist@@ res@@ sed situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran which is marked by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety and depression , and he ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that may arise in@@ ability to arise for his family , so Ah@@ w@@ Nazi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; one on YouTube &apos;s video held the moments , after he had infl@@ ated himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the combustion were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide who has taken place in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists from the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ h Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family @-@ fathers that felt because of the persecution of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to im@@ itate a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab ancestors suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab @-@ Nazi community is located in the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community , has been troubled by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the arab@@ ic Ah@@ wa@@ z was an predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and took great efforts to stop the ethnic autonomy of Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil fields of oil and gas fields , as well as some of the largest and most valuable commercial areas for Iranian farming . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only gets few of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime denied any systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also has a variety of dam@@ s built , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to devast@@ ation the devast@@ ation in the region by dro@@ ught but to destroy local agriculture as well as fish and palm trees .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k youth rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are searching for a job , completed the primary school , 55 % a further school termin@@ ated and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... which aims at destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial racial discrimination , &quot; led to a &quot; high rise in the number of self @-@ murder among the young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that particularly unemployment has become worse . the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persian and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not preferred Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi movement will be depri@@ ved of access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their pre@@ - and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and thus be questioned as even the Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , because speaking of Arabic language or the carrying arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi must endure , human rights activists , before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoidable .

&quot; why I cannot identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with inter@@ sec@@ tional parts &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Las@@ i , and originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions , in which many different positions expressed . &quot;
you can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ists and why we generally should be all femin@@ ism * .
&quot; for example , women today still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they may do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women arrive sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blan@@ ket , and discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I am double and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to talk about skin color , in racism , on black hair @-@ women , on black transi@@ tions , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , when I speak , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to up@@ lift &quot; their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence , we are exposed to black women at two times . &quot;
&quot; or above that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and cities of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girl and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand I will , that all women , all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join the black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refused to consider in@@ justi@@ ces in their thinking , which relate to the gender and the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; So@@ aring himself compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is in historical sense an evil and margin@@ alised being . &quot;
&quot; I want to join the group@@ ings that are also absorbed by cultural appropri@@ ation of our customs and customs , to drive their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to put white women out the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different homes , and borders themselves from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I draw it before , to release me completely and entirely by femin@@ ism , which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of stub@@ born for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so stub@@ born , that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; it is more important now than ever , that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the sphere that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) that we can defend ourselves in this way , and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
in a wom@@ an@@ ist environment I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .

pad@@ do@@ ating against pollution : the mission of a man to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this contribution from To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published to En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;

&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ board , or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern due to Kurdistan in Iraq . his mission aims to consciously make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country are afraid that the decades of war , the construction of dust bun@@ es , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ re@@ Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a holds the urgency and importance of his work together in a question : &quot; &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq , and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , is filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on ver@@ ted , little form@@ alized sub@@ cultures and is characterised by the use of co@@ oper@@ ative vide@@ ography and new multi @-@ media techniques , with their help oppressed communities to tell their stories their way . &quot;
Paraguay Women and her difficult fight against violence
a group of women represents the crying women &quot; to express their pain over the women of women in the country and in the region and to show their rejection .

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ghting ) that reports about the violence of violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names have been amended to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; police Com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , their expor@@ ters who had become violent @-@ violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship has passed some time and the police said , her statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as a further wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena due to abuse , also the acoustic display of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved their ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; when women re@@ funding the display at all , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who mis@@ ts them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities . &quot;
content 1 beats and Statisti@@ ken@@ 2 Un@@ visible abuse and a legal system that has nothing under @-@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paraguay legislation : good approach to def@@ ective implementation of bats and statistics
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women really are mis@@ led , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , research scientist for Gen@@ der@@ ask at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports that don &apos;t even show the amount of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the numbers available are very alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office there were 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . at 70 % of it all went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the adver@@ ts in the police came from women .
there have been more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace . here also 86 % of the indicators came from women .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mis@@ tic , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ otic abuse . &quot;
these statistics however do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women &apos;s Minister in Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on every woman , which will be reimbur@@ sed in Paraguay due to psych@@ ical abuse notification , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman , which are re@@ funded because of body abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; they declared it at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not their own crimes , the law enforcement authorities cannot be documented adequately , how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
alone to August 2016 en@@ umer@@ ated journalists at least 12 cases of women &apos;s involvement in the country alone .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men .

&quot; invisible missions and a legal system , which is nothing &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called her the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t really want it , but after all , but after all , this should be rep@@ ented for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together . but two years now , she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable : &quot;
I would never thought that I would be the victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women happen to be underestimated , because they are dec@@ eived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote posts on Facebook , in which she described his insul@@ ts and different attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people rep@@ lied on their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why they had fallen so long from Carlos , and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse , at least a certain complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner become her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ otic abuse .
&quot; their aff@@ lu@@ ent partner finally managed to convince them , that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it carried out a process against its former partners who developed into an im@@ penetr@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay legislation : good approach , def@@ ective implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ad of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also looks great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament who was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # FÃ¼r@@ ke ) . &quot;
&quot; this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter , which is supported by Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the original design of the law considers that Fem@@ izi@@ d has to explain to an independent criminal offen@@ se and be tougher to pun@@ ish as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the law text was changed in some points to also gain members for the law that may be p@@ aves the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions that are currently prohibited in Paraguay up to five years and must be punished up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was envisaged , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) process costs that have to wear the victims of violence at present themselves , if they just want to re@@ funding and receive a safe accommodation to the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law was not effective if the legis@@ lature has not provided adequate financial resources for this purpose :
in Paraguay the abuse is seen as a part of human relationships .
&quot; here , a re@@ perc@@ eiving must take place so that violence is no longer viewed as something normal . &quot;
&quot; he who is silent in the face of this facts , makes him guilty and contributes to the do@@ ers of the offen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; we need to report such a long ad , until it is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been amended , including a passage that has called the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the views of the changes are apart .
&quot; the section on reconciliation has been viewed as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor , his sacrifice once again attack . &quot;
&quot; the stri@@ ction of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law however is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man to ban a newspaper after ban on a newspaper
&quot; this website was locked due to a compl@@ ain@@ ant of the information Minister &apos; is locked in the homepage of the &quot; &quot; bot@@ anic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ bian authorities have concluded the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the Sultan . &quot;
&quot; You@@ z@@ al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but later came again freely . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had abolished his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state . &quot;
&quot; since then he has dressed , in addition to his role as the only sult@@ an , the most important offices in the country : prime minister , Minister of Defense , Minister of Defence , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Minister of Minister for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the domination of the sult@@ ans is marked by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic trade service , public freedom , including freedom of freedom , freedoms and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically portra@@ yed peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights , and advocate citizens , also activists , their views on public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a tough blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man since its inception in 2007 ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief of Az@@ am@@ n , announced , after published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking parties tie the hands of the judiciary . &quot; in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary and the intervention of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials acc@@ uses the judge of the Supreme Court in O@@ man under pressure to raise a judgment in a inheritance tax . &quot;
&quot; the Az@@ am@@ n issue of 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bind hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , was charged by the ISS on the Special Department and arrested upon his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS J@@ Ã³@@ d@@ war@@ der You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j took place after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is Fest@@ ing as a che@@ ery editor .
&quot; the paper was closed at some time after the Minister of Justice had given the statement that &quot; &quot; the publication and dissemination of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the court condemned the three journalists to prison terms and also ra@@ ining the final closing of the paper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining of the state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a publication of bot@@ s and sl@@ ander@@ ing .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ ic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year prison and a pro@@ clamation in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) , after he used the use of a information network for the dissemination of material that could be a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail of â¬ 5000 @-@ Dollar was fixed for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the Jud@@ gment of Jud@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ al Court said Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to the prison of his six month sentence , prison in mas@@ quer@@ ading . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was pro@@ secuted his one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Justice to include the newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of judgment , Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks after attacks by the Polish government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information Minister sent a directive with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further instruction , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended to three additional months and with which the Minister asked another time against the decision of the appeal , the publication of the paper again . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man , the press freedom has been injured . &quot;
&quot; for other injuries , the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , are the first independent online newspaper of the country to adapt its operations . &quot;
&quot; because of the prolonged closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalists Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) demands the om@@ anic authorities on : &quot;
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j is immediate and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
2 . create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper so that their journalists can do their work .
3 . to protect the press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man be imp@@ eded the human rights of human rights , and without fear of supportive measures , including judicial Shi@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf Region and in neighbouring countries by promoting opinion and freedom of opinion , and providing them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia is done by permission
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need to run on site medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of global health system many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists themselves , while building its own research capacity in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ ors at the Center for the investigation of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s he grew in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic showed first grave consequences on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself explored HIV virus at the HIV virus until he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡@@ mi health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media concerning this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what do you think are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain benefici@@ ary instead of being makers of themselves . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are very well encouraged .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here , because the funding and development prospects are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there is interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
G@@ V : how big is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa and what should they focus on and how can we support development ?
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that represent challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that periodic@@ als can make articles accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , limited also the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot;
&quot; this entry of Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions to environmental problems . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has grown in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 sorts , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronom@@ ers in space . &quot;
&quot; for nearly 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was only given by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sal@@ ts can get , boundaries . &quot;
&quot; but in the early 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented and that it was therefore not able to use them further for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents g@@ old not only for individual varieties , but also for specific characteristics such as resili@@ ence over diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants like cereals or cart@@ els . due to these trends there is plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security around the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of ancient tradition , Mor@@ ton still holds salad , but he needs for this longer time , since its work is becoming more and more difficult for its work . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if a river would lie in a river a rock bro@@ ck , in order to p@@ add@@ ling the p@@ add@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; so we must do that now , but it is a break with the tradition of breeding , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go on Sal@@ ads too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand in court , no one can breed any new let@@ tu@@ aries , because all the features are patented . so he is doing as good as possible and tries to draw up those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material being protected as a intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that becomes ever greater in the US and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the international space station ISS have red red Roman sal@@ at of the variety of red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station &quot; bred and eaten . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that , as the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; software , &quot; providing alternatives to copyrighted software . &quot;
&quot; it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and -@@ gens are not protected as intellectual property , and thus can be used permanently for plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , in short Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can commit to that other seeds can use seed freely . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others to breed their seeds , as well as prescribed immediately - two aspects that have been prohibited or prescribed by many plants . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor of University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , seed plays an important role in larger groups such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seed with natural resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasises that the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; movement does not work with GM plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , made in ecological agriculture or Mon@@ santo and Bayer , who are increasingly popular in August or September 2016 . &quot; those who want to buy good , local and sustainable , producing vegetables , should also know that the way is bred based on how this vegetables is bred . &quot;
&quot; dietary sovereign , without seed sovereign , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to provide others with seeds as well as to patent its action in contrast , seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of the food supply is at risk , as the available pool is due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on the plant material , which is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has dealt with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . it found out that about a third of all cardboard features is protected as intellectual property , whereby it is not only usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suggests that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are cultivated so bred that they have specifically desirable characteristics - of such , through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and to resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available crop material for bre@@ eder is decreasing due to ever more patents . genetic diversity is currently unnecessary , but ever since the changed conditions caused by climate change are far worse . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ santo Spe@@ ad@@ u@@ to recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ santo &apos;s activities . with a total of four gen@@ ders and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States , the company is preparing for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property restric@@ ts other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is exp@@ ired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions can help others come to the same result with another method . &quot;
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees this differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent difference , is certainly not a innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait such a long time to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one should have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a general public and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ ary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want to make farmers their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it is impossible to make us use of the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept to patented , plant characteristics : &quot; we did not really create the features . &quot;
the plants grow themselves and as breeders we have no clue how the plants do .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US @-@ state Oregon and Os@@ si @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; whoever inspir@@ es its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with big cour@@ ty@@ ards and mon@@ o@@ cular architec@@ tures , for their cultivation , her@@ bi@@ wise her@@ bi@@ cide , who grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just fine . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such as Mon@@ santo are patents ) , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ santo are patents , they create the majority of smaller seed companies - either they refuse the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder &apos;s bre@@ eder by the prevention of plant pat@@ ent innovative would : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new , stronger than a company that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalog , as I know my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are only 20 years before competition , which makes it very easy for me to make it very beautiful . &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; plant breeding program works with farmers , helping them to breed new varieties , meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seed , and to sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , plus the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive Board of the European Union , the European Commission , explained that conventional bred plants should not be patented . this makes it possible to oppose the current practice of the European patent office , the patents on conventional bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States , the patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference to &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems that the organization currently establishes a worldwide alliance for &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation , and others - a report published on seeds , to exchange and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also stressed the importance of a varied , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection , by which Lu@@ by von Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is above all ensured , where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role &quot; , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organisation and Blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
still unlock the Egyptian authorities on the Internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government has reported the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which reported human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported via sel@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network released a comment on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed this step sharp@@ ly and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the Network for Human Rights Information - despite this attack and the reduction of Egyptian law and the Constitution by the authorities , who must defend the law in this part of the world and to give victims a voice . even though it has never been such difficult as now . AN@@ H@@ RI is confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to im@@ itate it . we insist that we continue to fulfill our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities block up to 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ speaking issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the Qatar coming network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support from terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is also no access to the blog of the Kolum@@ nis@@ ts and human rights sciences Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the spread of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles that he does not write to accessible websites and media in Egypt .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ scri@@ bed the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , who is also home to a zi@@ adas blog , but on the other hand is more accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards and recorded a video , like the police of bodily violence against two students . &quot;
his article focuses primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the block through the government and reflected , what this means to him : &quot;
&quot; the , blogs to block is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ .The al @-@ S@@ isi - and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of a si@@ ege governing board ; a arrest , a attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the block blogs as well as any other website , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) They proved that I was not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ te go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 web pages . this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE documented also the locking of vendors , possible through the circum@@ ference of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the block of websites , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s started . &quot;
such practice points to the intention of the government to further block content and filter to the Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation will additionally be conce@@ aled that the cens@@ ored decisions behind closed doors are made , thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis , helping them to proceed against this action . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and whom will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army was in use in the Fav@@ our@@ se in N@@ iter@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis . &quot;

&quot; day for day report papers in Brazil with whis@@ pering headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of many post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; Je@@ w@@ ro@@ b pharmacy in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; th@@ iev@@ es rou@@ ge pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the Army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence in Rio achieved the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports such as these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; in which they announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision declared the paper so :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that occur in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sexual ver@@ aging , etc everything that happens in Rio , is published in the heading &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty of cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video which was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor of the newspaper , that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
&quot; extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world , with a war of war in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize war . &quot;
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that , according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas , that are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial board the newspaper writes :
&quot; we are aware that a war course , when it is distorted , can also be used , cru@@ ises of the police , which can only go wrong and then ask questions to fail . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; mean more than they mean ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , he ar@@ gues the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira that force violence as a &quot; war &quot; . &quot; this is the opinion of a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro was one of the most violent place in Brazil , according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the federal state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; if we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company of South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stressed , has repeatedly stressed the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; this security policy also belonged to the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the federal state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a Fav@@ ela by using a massive police record , and to take a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for several years , the U@@ PP was supposed to protect against the poor communities and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux came from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio does not set the - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the name of &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; for this calls for the state to use means and ways which are typical of war . in addition , the penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and for the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; lost balls &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war , or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ our@@ se in Rio continues to suffer . &quot;
&quot; one week now , it is now that the police cl@@ ot@@ omy the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident took place : a fruit seller died as a result of shots , which had folded the police out of a helicopter . &quot;

to stay alive : besi@@ eged Sy@@ rer to plant mushrooms

source : Can@@ do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian Revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal cr@@ ush and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Re@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib about one million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta is particularly affected by East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack against chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations of the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practiced by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these of rebels have been controlled outside of Damascus under si@@ ege which led to these people on local , or through tunnels and check@@ points are dependent on food items . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become in@@ accessible for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source &quot; . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ lies and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional foods in Syria , and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional benefits makes them an attractive food resource for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tion of the Project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said opposite the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years now , and expressed its relief that it gains more and more &apos; promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ gen as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to bring 125 families to planting mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of approximately 12.@@ 700 â¬ , but will collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that hold temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity in 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel consumption , locally manufactured fuel cells are used to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing &quot; &quot; production &quot; &quot; from the regions , before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom in a tub . when this was managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , the mushrooms have been distributed to the east G@@ hou@@ ta for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; frac@@ ture of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by serving eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee code , cart@@ on , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; jobs new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on October 21st in many district of districts in Portugal and called for justice for the victims of fires , which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured due to the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government of last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 mar@@ qu@@ arri@@ es , spread across the north and centrally located regions of the country and reached about 250 million acres of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June occurred in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , a similar tragedy , where it was caused by the fires of 64 deaths and over 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest @-@ surfaces by satellite recording , alone in Portugal , some 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .
&quot; Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) , October 15th , 2017 &quot;
some of the Twitter @-@ users shared pictures :
this is Bra@@ ga tonight . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into the action :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy ...
the goal of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why civil protection was not able to include the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ el from the federal government of farmers in Portugal stated the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
from Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o streets and villages for everything and nothing ev@@ acu@@ ated .
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are d@@ utz@@ fold reports of open roads , which were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June as the streets were very late locked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in Ã@@ r@@ t@@ ys will be questioned with high fire risk . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal to the wal@@ tri@@ form , which the government had brought into heavy fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ection@@ able by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law that allowed the construction of the case , if the applicant has had funds to protect self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; says JoÃ£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees made from slightly fl@@ amm@@ able wood , spread as in a vi@@ cious circle , according to fires of this species . &quot;
&quot; these issues are added that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when people were looking for information or trying to contact relatives , which was offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt , and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o P@@ ina , to simplify the work of fire bri@@ ga@@ des and was passed on to that f@@ ateful weekend in October so crucial that the server per@@ secuted to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who pursued the fires : there was more than half a million submission . &quot;

&quot; in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a fri@@ ghtful civil war between the different mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings had been defeated , which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan became a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew she could no longer see her son very long - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning the boy should break up .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari the leader of the party of Haz@@ ara @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara were suddenly sen@@ sel@@ ess .
the Taliban made for their hatred on the Haz@@ ara @-@ known Taliban came closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his run , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , he worked in a coal . the work was heavy and made him sick . &quot;
&quot; then he took what was left out of its low wages , and went to Iran . once again , he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish bags with mor@@ tar , who were more difficult than he himself to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; at that time as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees had been shaped by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af reminded in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the job@@ site where we worked on . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we put the n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we will not fres@@ her at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; when the dangerous over@@ ride along the sea suffered a boat from the boat , and stran@@ ts on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af arrived in 2002 to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church who shared twice a day meal for people . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy due to relatively high priority quot@@ as is a kind of second chance for ex@@ cre@@ ased asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country are disastrous . &quot;
the Human Rights organization Civil liberties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be housed in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared staff . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a recording center if it officially allowed a request for asylum - which can still be climbed for months after the registration of asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have any money for accommodation , either dependent on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
that is how it also erg@@ es A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his in@@ viol@@ able CV helped A@@ shar@@ pen , soon to free from these conditions . &quot;
&quot; after spending several years in the construction sector for several years , A@@ shar@@ af tasted its total savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this went so well , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a schn@@ el@@ lim@@ iss . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; in 2017 , the film was awarded the Venice City Award , which has been awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are only a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of the Afgh@@ ans developed companies , including tail@@ oring , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and staff are largely refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu features the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals are rich , however , far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y industry and the retail and aim to go back to the country he had to leave out as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily , if I know that my people suffer . &quot;
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same capabilities as anyone else . &quot;
&quot; it also includes plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; thus , they can sell their harv@@ ets on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament reviews its draft law , which shows that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users would have to be able to use social networks within six months following the successful rule of law on the website of the authority under stating their full name , as well as their reference number . &quot;
anyone who has failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the en@@ closure of a criminal payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , lies at the moment the legislative and the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; may , another member of the Parliament voted for a proposal to be introduced in the har@@ dening pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the president or of a high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President as well as state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . under the law proposition a such act would however be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so right experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be passed , this can be up to three years in prison for the condem@@ nations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate where the right to freedom of expression and freedom of association have already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , when he photographed violence against demonstrators , who had demonstrated against the military coup that led to the officers of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest players who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison line according to human rights groups were deb@@ ated to bring the accused from prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the exposure of inter @-@ arms , illegal gathering , murder and tried murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza said the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary freely . they were indicted for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who have also been arrested for the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
tun@@ es@@ ian activists to inter@@ cep@@ ted documents
&quot; in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the hear of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at , and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been princip@@ ally supported to a corro@@ bor@@ ated action plan . bes@@ po@@ unded Plan comes from the President of the Republic , who would be expressly warran@@ ted by the President of the Republic , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption provided by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali &apos;s corruption provided all un@@ justi@@ fiable funds . &quot;
&quot; the document released on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at document , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support legislation . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to mention its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press release which journalists secure the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their ID .
&quot; according to new provisions of the Information Council of the People &apos;s Information Council , the users need social media in China before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is also stated that registration with the full re@@ real name will be required . &quot;
analy@@ st suspect that this will be achieved through the elimination of anonymous comments in discussions within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities apply these rules .
Chinese ret@@ ina have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations to protect citizen journalism and its independence .

&quot; this name is part of a law dating from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government introduces a list of online services that will be responsible for releasing content , and to force them on request for removing user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ od@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mailing service . &quot;

&quot; a Turkish court ordered the block Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data , Turkey supporting the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication had been locked , the side was closed because it works for &quot; a source of information , which collabor@@ ates with groups to escal@@ ate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely . it is therewith , in addition to China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
great Britain can not stop beating
&quot; after this week , the government of Britain is in the midst of a targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers , the internet service provider would force to monitor communication in real time and install back@@ door programs , encryp@@ t the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left the other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . responses and proposals by members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of Interior . &quot;
