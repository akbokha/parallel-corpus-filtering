<seg id="1">Although I visited the US for at least once a year I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation grew up with American films, American music had danced, American authors have been danced and operated in sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"indeed, this country had profound effects on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as the 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The pelican letter, a terrible reporter who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Students, who were much inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," "me it's, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, this is what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting you can always be that you are and it is easy acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very warm love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most remarkable aspect of his ascension is for me, as he is dealing with his bottiness."</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds behind the mountain with his opinion how to say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks of how a former colleague put it, and publicly declare his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in saries."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigotte person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't get Trump and his voters not in line with the people I met at Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"as for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the Journalism programme, which took people from all over the world, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mumps of the worldview does not coincide with the name of Peter Bhatia, the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Intolerant is also in contrast to the generosity that I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who struggling for life long and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she is still adapting to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of the American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by they express my love of America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump his way to nominee Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart at his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, the presidency for a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were prepared to overlook these things, broke me nearly the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people," "said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are known, voted for Trump because they would like to regain control of a country that she disappointed us?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that in this America they are still important?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one cannot forget the words of David Remnick who commented the cruel decision, a man who looks down with contempt upon those who look different from it."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(m. WC.: as much as" recording of the white against all other ethnicities "; word game from white in allotment for white and whiplash, which means as much as Schleukatrauma), as it was the great Van Jones called, exactly what America has done so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which belief or background you may have always, America is always welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land, as his President, chose twice the son of a Kenyman whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, Donald Trumps is a huge part of the White America's promise, and says: to Hell with multiplicity, religious freedom and all the concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the Ruder, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton Mr. Khan had a change of change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" brood the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" I answered them.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no! they cried out, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a vocal and onomic "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with words:" God be thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now the misery country, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could no longer find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="70">"the music that is played at both places, not only the life of the children has changed, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists but worlds from nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for a couple of years now, La Banda de Música (Music Association) in the municipality: one of children and adults with existing symphony orchestra, which has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music-school with 100 students is a central interest for the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their obligations to the music group very serious about the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI.</seg>
<seg id="79">Once they come from school they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to go to their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with gleaming eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, glitresses, Pauks, Pauline, Bongo and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically at the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made of recursive waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recreated instruments that consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez began to transform parts of apostasy into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate Goch, viola, Celli, bass, bass, saxophones, trumpet, trumpet, trombones and percussion that were all made from the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article of Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez is reminded of a local economist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place the parents worked in the trash. the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents, because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something that he had never seen before: one of waste hered violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra which plays on instruments recovered and called The recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) paints the musical performance on:</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fought.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this article, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, published a magazine that specifically reports international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication is set within an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa then it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing fishing, before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the East African countries were correspondded accordingly, and little inclined to welcome a legislative brecher of this kind at its coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilised himself against the ship. they refused to give one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing place."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly, the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything. "" recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leading clerk of the Kenyan fisherman. he is part of a team that was discovered and followed by ship. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of pillage of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protects, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fisheries stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"the members of this network are beside Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries which then had driven the prime minister from its waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" this makes us eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand for each other at where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending illegally Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is concealed, being extremely difficult to trace. thus, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"through the intentional contempt of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and species should be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fisheries were once hindered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, for example, the individual countries can replace lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move around the open sea, with satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to mark the authorities to mark ships that fish in reverbered areas. also, such a suspicious driver to discover that a ship has its captured fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence, where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal offender."</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries which are against illegal fishing are based on this information will then refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports. so that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to the numbers of sanctions as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing catch is not worthwhile itself anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leader Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to gain valued 20 million USD to lost sales, which lose the eight members of the network HISH-i every year due to illegal fishermen who penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East-Africa has one of the most productive tuna fissures who pulls the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"among other practices, such activities include the sailing under falcons, counterfeit roypapers, indication of fantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature conservation areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a not completely organised control system, "says Long." "earlier a ship could fish illegally fish and a country could then say 'you could not start my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me "." "and precisely this legal cramp is trying to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception FISH-i has been involved in over 30 investigations of suspects ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has discovered criminal networks, which had distributed counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships who used several fraudulent identities and it has been tracked ships and found volatile vessels."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "" says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is supposed to help FISH-i, suspicious ships to be precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, helps to record illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position. and we try to cross it, "says Duncan Copeland, Chefanalyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO, which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be made of satellite."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that combines various information with each other. it should help FISH-i, to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team for African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believe that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened together with Google and the Sea Protection organisation Oceana the platform Global Fishing Watch: a platform that offers satellite data, and through which the position of every single traceable vessel can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of who what is doing - this is simply meaning", "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run, where a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities do not only feel criminals, but they also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used earlier without a license and hardly expected to count on consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i participating countries have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fisheries boats have more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia helped to record Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board Schleppnets, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that now also other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa every year, several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015, six countries joined the West Africa Task Force. they now also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model such as FISH-i." "security is the goal of making even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member country in Somalia could report his first major triumph: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under wrong flag. and not only was the ship being used without a license and got hauling nets that are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated into botbottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the take of measures against Greko 1, which proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a particular, collaborative way of working methods are actually working throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. where she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and in The Guardian. location in Venezuela is continuing to say: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capturing the country."</seg>
<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also led in other parts of the country - among other things, in the lowland of Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, located in central-eastern Bundestaat Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the federal state of Nueva."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country deteriorates continuously, which makes itself noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicine."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw their chance at the counterpart of the current President Nicolás Maduro, the chance of a fundamental change; ultimately, the management of a new election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarised the context of the state of government in their latest article:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence has been valued at the highest all over the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a grave and extensive lack of food and medicine was considered to be the only way to restore its institutional structures and to join a new governance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the election of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: rround table of the Democratic unit), in which the opposition to the President Nicolás Maduro was put together to support the National Assembly, as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan Government, on the 3rd of November, should continue to persist the blocking of the referendum."</seg>

<seg id="231">"at the first time and last time, he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>

<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">"over, the prisoners are tortured."</seg>
<seg id="238">"I entered, and saw a lying, tortured on the human being."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field-bed and metal springs.</seg>

<seg id="244">"years later, when my father stood under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>

<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that a person can do so much suffering from another?</seg>
<seg id="248">"I knew that these people were killed"</seg>

<seg id="251">In the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked humans with the face below - all were captivated by hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">In the proximity of the entrance there remained silent on the mattresses.</seg>

<seg id="254">"" "why did you hear me otherwise?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew that these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and were killed by soldiers and buried.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero there came a man and killed.</seg>

<seg id="264">"here, their names have been changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of dehumanization."</seg>

<seg id="267">The 'War'</seg>

<seg id="269">"at that time at the age I had no idea what the" "war" "- as they called it - was."</seg>

<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, head of security forces, could participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I just don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">"I was also Officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter into a house, and to steal everything in it."</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do this.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I replied, and thou hast thou miest cars on the road?"</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a crime?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded in anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>

<seg id="288">"at that time, the Defence accused me to have been a conjure in this crime. I refute no problem, they can put me into the burden of what they wanted."</seg>

<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl with his home, whose mother was killed."</seg>

<seg id="299">"I always asked the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">One could have simply put them into prison.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I appreciate it was simply decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to pass the remains of their remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">"the extravagance of the body is the last abominable act, which one can do to a man."</seg>

<seg id="307">"I have seen how you killed humans! '</seg>
<seg id="308">Only to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">"the thought, to indicate my father came during a conversation, when he stood under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">"I made him accusations because of all of the atrocities, which I had to experience."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overturn one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the output text, and active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active rule of the target language - something that is in case of motherlanguage. in general, the conviction that translators are in the target language - not in the language language - motherlanguage."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native language should translate from English into French, not from the French."</seg>

<seg id="381">"a lot of Japanese companies employ no employees with English as native language, the translations into English. this may be misunderstanding of understanding, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even have no foreign employees, but can still be finished internally. then, the Japanese employee, his English knowledge as the best one can be added to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>

<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the puzzling and puzzling propositions emerge, which can be produced by machine translation, show that this technique does not substitute for a long time to no human translator. this applies to some languages very special."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often use T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo of Flickr users Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry, or at least harmless. but of large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="423">"business is quite simple: a big family with little money transmits her underage son or her underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange receives the child food, education and a roof over the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"but what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victim to abuse and abuse - and all that is within the framework of a contract that cannot be uplift."</seg>
<seg id="425">"as Criadazgo, this practice is widely used in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after completing their studies, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization dedicated to the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she spoke with Criadita - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - gathered testimony, researched and pranated."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to mention things in the name, because the feeling of thankfulness that is vaccinated with crimp's crimp is guaranteed in general."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand it is the family that her daughter is in faith, that they will conclude their training to improve their position in society and make something out of themselves", "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who takes the girl in himself and justify their exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training, and perhaps even starve."</seg>

<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira struck with a stick on Marín until they suffered fatal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They emphasised that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted in the paraguayischen company's practice of criadazgo for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They marked the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>

<seg id="460">In the house of her employers Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she was still time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="462">It was up at 5 p.m. every morning and prepared breakfast for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleanse the fridge, plasted the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was at an end she went back home and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more they finished with learning, the more spare time it had."</seg>
<seg id="466">"however, this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers."</seg>

<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which lies in the prefecture of Miyagi. the prefecture of Miyagi was a ettish prefectures in Japan-East, which both had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring-Préarchitectures Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had to disappear whole coastal cities from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima prefecture had a nuclear accident, which is why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the Special Report of Kahoku Shimpo shows the progress made six years after that, in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction and poll results of the person concerned themselves.</seg>

<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned spare parts (should be known, saigai kouei Miliutaku) in the prefectures of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures was recorded at Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima is encircled by 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one still makes every effort to relocate six years after the disaster, evacuated of accommodation-accommodation (in the heart rate, casetsu juutaku) in final spare parts."</seg>

<seg id="782">"sometimes I have the feeling as if I am the only one that hipped or sad. it seems like a lack of respect for the person, who once belonged to this body."</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">It is continuing to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old Cousin think that he is foco (German: drug dealers) will be when he is great. and it is also not normal that people listen to the" heroism "of offenders, if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they have caves, who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories are becoming real numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of the people is incredible for me if the death of six people and the unwind of 43 students in a neighbor can therefore be justified that they were "ascended."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to speak, that they remain spared from such tragedies when they are not stirred and silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" four months blackmail in the main town district: as a family with threats dropped off. in this, she describes how the armed criminal month was paid for month money by their business, until they end not only the business, but also demolished their family apart.

<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the contribution "The forgotten Children of Ciudad Juárez: one of violence posted.</seg>

<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, potatoes, tortillas warm and" Chichi "for the babies which is with him. this is his name for preparing the vial of water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to pain in his eyes - unspeakable for a boy for whom whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But that was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood has been past two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, who was shot by armed men out of a passing driving car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world, due to the number of murders, according to the number of citizens for public security and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Prosecutor's Office was called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to 8.5 Morden per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just some of the hundreds of thousands of thousands who have organised crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live on the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>

<seg id="1136">Can there be an opportunity to contact someone here and now in spite of a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the creators of stories in their original language is a possible answer to it."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird, the unbridgeable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language variety of major cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has already been conducted in 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed to the children there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">The creators of the project apply:</seg>
<seg id="1142">"the mannequins of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, the diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to be part of it."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening more often, it is often connected to understand" "these events instead" "listen to the listening, to feel at ease."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their representation will allow the listening to it."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story teller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the narratives typical for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the tale of the rabbit and the Pavian in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after he explains the meaning of his Fabel, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is that to speak to an audience that does not understand your language? "" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness: "</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">You have been with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling in three cities have taken place, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who inspired by the project can be in contact with TLS, in order to organise their own destiny."</seg>

<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel was not able to know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would have everything to place it, that architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger on a corrupt, in which a government member returned after half of his sentence on the employment level in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money was from public funds from Mozambique airports, whose Council Cambaza is between 2005 and 2008."</seg>

<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Public Prosecutor of the Republic, given the application, there would be no hindrance for Cambaza to return to his old posts as the company was not accomplished a disciplinous procedure after his detention centre."</seg>

<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de Pública, shortly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned into an interview with the Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to put the director again:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinous objections to the reseller.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the firm apparently circulate and prompted no appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, rejects this behavior also and considers the case as" refusal. ""</seg>

<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook-users in Myanmar, the well known social network took their postings from the net, because it contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although about the origin of the word still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people ostindian origin or generally used as adjective" indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">Facebook censored the word "Kalar" or at the same time (in Burmical font) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network.</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely defledged connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that mostly used by Ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of sensory content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'Kalar is usually associated with racism, but the word in itself does not lead automatically hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed to the use of his usage."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several Burmese words with fundamental meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar Pae' (spage) or 'kalaraar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuse Aung Kaung Myat declared the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in spiritual ways whether he knew how he could alleviate his back pain, made a word play."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" "healing" "(ku) + the Frageword (la) in Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win htet is the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radicalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical, before being extinguish all Posts who resign in suspicion, racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you can write on Facts.</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example" "Kalar Htine" "(chair) and" Kalar Pae "(aging)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these three-minded nationalists, spread the hate speech, received a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now it is time to be circumcised at the time, its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action likes to send a strong signal to everyone, that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy does not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proved that the censorship of keywords often will start a cat- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks will simply start to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described, as Facebook began to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to notify my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail from Facebook was removed and I was forbidden to ignore the light, post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post" "Facebook Community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts of people who have no negative intentions or who just try to show their opinions against hate crimes against radicals.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post office, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community about advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform, but it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring these words will only bring more hatred inside the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so called" "chair" "or" "hersencurry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to put the falsibly deleted Posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would bring them a great turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship is provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts which no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and see hersencurry and watch some Indian film.</seg>

<seg id="1336">"in the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to increase their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech should be forced into social networks with violence in Myanmar in addition, especially in the territory Rakhine where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands of escape."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to speak the farious hate speech on his Burmese sites under control.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but rather than simply to censoring the word 'Kalar', it would be better to look at the context rather than code focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for over a month, Turkey has now been the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based Encyclopedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find helpful and reliable information and to share.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series are opposed to blocking the block.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many techniques-versed internet users used to use it, changing tools for blocking web pages (a current article from the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has published articles from Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, the Internet Act has been adopted since 2007, after the Internet law (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the two most known country in the world, when it comes to massive censorship by Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to be locked, there are several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), as the platform supports all Turkish Wikipedia sides on the decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus a complete censorship is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is not available in spite of legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the block from Wikipedia), we put everything from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, the possibility to read the content on decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to look at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach www.wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS has also been made that this step is independent of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">However Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvise the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklo.org, a Mirror page of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open-source project that everyone can use to host similar MirrorPages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was posted here as part of a content-sharing convention.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women prevent women with utmost care to speak the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they should respect the husband due to the social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should be misunderstood the norm in life."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year Malati Mahatoto was condemned from the Indian State of Odisha, and rejected by her family and the village community after having addressed a married relative."</seg>

<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"she has been working with the help of her videocamera for seven years with the help of her Videokamera, on the uncovering of practices such as children's rat up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS Indians, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in its discussion round, acted by women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking on the names of their husbands, a bread is also maintained that they maintain all conflicts and never asked questions."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini thinks:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wish him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not hold this, is regarded as being deposited as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband with her name until now, when he was running at home."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">"my mother-in-law, and my husband still outweigh for a long time after the video was ended."</seg>
<seg id="1492">"internash, my husband, turned to me and said I should name him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage the Rohini started its first discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "nor ever before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video project, women were trying to get the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini requested each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they asked all," If we can not say the name of our spouses, but they can tell us how they want, does it mean that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day in which they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas in Maharashtra over the Break of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women never declared the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she had only kicked off all the exercise, and another chose to allow the whole bottled frustration against him and his family by flooding it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in adrenalin flowing about it, with an ancient bracket broken, the women, that they would actually try at home to name their husbands with the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini, and asked what ideas she put into the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it during dinner prior to the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-mother she was stubborn, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arisen in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports, how women have tried to stop other practices such as wearing a cinder red point on the forehead, which indicates the Eheststatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinder red spot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I listened to it to wear it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped working completely, but they think they are now in a better position, even to choose him in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip with every discussion."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry who what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last few months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and spears and talked about things that they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have also made some things, such as our identities in our spouses, never spoke honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion board we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have carried only coffin since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it is okay, but some wanted a Salman-Kurta, a wide shirt of a pants, they did not trust."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussion about the merits of their own hangers, morality combined with the Saris and much more, jewellery Rohini her own pair of cranky (Oberhemden) in a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa in which they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure that they will create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"whether the first discussion has changed since its first discussion, Rohini confirms that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only taken small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then heard then again to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and are not any other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two say the name of their husbands; only one or two women carry at any time Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discusb know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - as the polish is about more freedom of movement or the own hanger - at the end of a difficult to navigating the river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"putting each other self-confidence, become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarch.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives everyone of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction if every woman goes home and told others about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories about which not reported.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid since Singapore is recognized at an international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, Shanmugam should be considered as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in the bloosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of the State of New York, the Ministers noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapur because they are compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He assures that Singapore should be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is it but most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," "turning the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this precious country, we hear that we are not in any country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, Whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons mentioned by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other" normal countries "," given it, he appeared invariably undemocratic. "</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the theme, the good old suffering from the authoritarian machinations will be to be Democrats, leaving democrats, since they fit better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end of the last week of Shanmugam given answers to its American guests regarding our press, our judictate, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Corresponding questions tared with non-responses rationale style.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clear his mind as they did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, for which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our more successful K Shanmugam would take the effort to clarify this point unless it was paid high, in order to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by clicking on the blog his comment, he points out regarding the critics that one should begin to see the whole transcript of the conference to better understand the context of statements by Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city, and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore is rather a" "city" "as a country," he stated why the elections in Singapore says so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He adored Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party to win a party?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as he said, Singapore" is not a country, "he obviously has not meant in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is acting as leaders of a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>

<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - be I agreed with them or not, but this is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leader of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure whether he really believes it is, properly associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review dismantle the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam "welled a mistake" or was it a Freudian speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only regarded as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the auction, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of severe importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the Singapore authorities make their military service, they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Whom should our Prime Minister pay back?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink human resource price?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and always has a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I did not say, what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have annoyed many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "defense of the country above all", "but that is not quite true."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the newest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question which is most posed to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?</seg>

<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his conversation, by giving personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"on my clear position then usually follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature. "many Canadians have been booming inside anger, if they are held for Americans, but does not bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians bring a Canadian flag well visible in their rucksack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans in contrast....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I started traveling 20 years ago, through the world - especially Donald Trump, in front of the march in Iraq and September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1767">"however, there are also some problems with the stamp" nice. ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, as" "nice" "means to be, in essence, to be enough - just like the good-natured, gentle, but tragically an important figure of Ned Flanders from" The Simpson "(which has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada really would be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders would be indeed a step forward. but the actual problem is that "nice" no personality has.</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing, where you can come across."</seg>
<seg id="1771">"harmless, is to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to earn."</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing, if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen to get around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go far as far as we go, to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a protagonist of the Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders as" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>

<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of a given youth:" "my lord, my father has to worry."</seg>

<seg id="2090">The jordanic rapper Emsallam Hdaib speaks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance. "</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends the most of his time inside, and he returns to his painting, even to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"but what one can rely on, is a cigarette between his fingers or his with nicotine to discover their lips."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which had been listening to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed its occupation by the West Bank and forced Hdaibs to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as rocky (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for the six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who is confronted with the conservative majority and questioned their old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free speech by art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees. all these topics do not only find in his hometown Amman Relevance, but also in cities that vary from Damascus to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as a man who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can feel compassion on the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not reveal it openly, he triumphs a particular disinclination to the American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe that his compassion for those who attempt to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as a" Palestinian depledged of the second generation "- so he describes himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think because of my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so because I am a human being, while in water, Nescafé sticks in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; at this time it is planned for Muslims from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Law Law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking down with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in an sensing called Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slipped warm coffee and the waiters of the kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you have a look into the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it would be easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water - to not end in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordan announced a performance of the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Action Front - in argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontrunner Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and the main reason for concert forecast."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The members and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition of DIMA Tahbb said in an interview with CNN that the concert "just said" because of the sexual orientation of the Skaners.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim to be the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is of hazardous activism, which constitutes the old proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila is a" "progressive supporter of human rights", "which continues to stand up for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is likely not to be simply seizing rhetoric, but actually a more and more clear crystalline reality in Jordan which appears in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards can be surpassed by having his vision of the fate of Arabian wives who have pre-marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-known woman, whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women, who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'honorary morde' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"human Rights Watch reached its climax in the year 2016. however, the number of honorary infrastructure reached its peak; however, Jordan is still lacking to have the women who tried victims of murder or domestic violence have become an adequate way of supporting."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the disruption of the year 1954 women, who are exposed to risk of internal violence," at an indefinite time in prison, "and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee from the family that the woman shall not happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs Music also enjoys great popularity, and is well-known, not to withdraw from themes that were long as tabu in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib will dispute that his work is political, however, that he puts his music, the full explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, Mann."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"my policy was confessed," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are at the core of political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song with the title "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market in which one can get, in his words," that is what you want "- is it belief or non-faith, heterosexuality or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality have been greatly censored by the LGBTQ + individuals.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular jordian Onlineprogram Roya, to later notice that his comments were taken from the context, distorted and being censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib open for the arabic TQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory today thanks to its homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuvo, who later once again work on behalf of the calibre, was openly able to write homosexuality in the eighth century, why cannot Jordanier not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government attacks attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the deputy Intelligence service took several former members of government members and members of the Magerassociation, with the rationale, they expressed themselves critical about the problems with the deeply rooted in the country with the deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"according to what is the concert of Hdaibs, according to what is the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordan river."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a continual giving and taking. Jordan has distresisted Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks slow, depressions and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the jordan society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib is dreaming, like millions of other Arabs also, from an Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only about his work until Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is suffering from music, art and literature on real and basic openness - and not by bombs, partitions and artificient democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until that time, Hdaib will continue, and therefore also resist resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, the Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution of" "love message to guerridescent", "which has published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who have spread out, affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this question went out to the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young Art and Cristian Palacios of the Young-Youth Foundation, and inspired her to the campaign Cartas por la Reverliación (letters of reconciliation), the young people to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, her country venue was a historic event and they wanted to contribute her part: after years of negotiation, the Colombian government signed a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces Colombia), which forms the closing of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"International was devoted to the signating of the peace treaty than so significant, that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, in front of the Kolumbianists, there is a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who had been exposed to illegal camps for many years, had been exposed to war rhetorrhetoric and carried out around the clock by the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases, deeply towards guerrilla war, must now take in its ranks and support them while building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians join together and had to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And this is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people wrote letters - love message to former guerrilla warfare in order to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare, which are to be handed over to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for atonement was born on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there's Leonardo and Cristian the possibility to speak shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we love the people who we love, am writing thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told everyone to share his love with people this year, which was most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC to write their place in society and have to build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected under the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities Columbus such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I would never thought that someone would have given me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students at the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo, of the Foundation of Bogotkind reists in the camp to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC agreed on, as they did earlier to counter the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of women from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can be passed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and all that lies in between, "" told the political sciences Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an assistant of the governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had handed down the letters, a former fighter led me through the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla warfare live), I saw an guerrilla war that wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to take up, because beside him on the bed was an MGL-pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the bush."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I spoke to him nevertheless, and asked," "hello, what do they say?" "I answered," "I answered a letter, whom someone wrote me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life someone has written me something so beautiful, that's why I answering my tears away over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I missed him quite firmly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companion of this fighters and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never expected anything else from life to war. the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of the Hungertod." "I never thought that someone would have given me for my fault."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society out there, who are waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"up to now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn a lot of things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"in the prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion board."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students had all grown up as a war and the FARC already signed in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views about the peace process:" many years we have experienced how the social injustice has been on the whole of the Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this scale it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never heard heard before and had no voting right, and to recognize that people that I have often seen as monsters and had even hate them, even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - even those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander's camp in Caldono Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Kolumbianists was made white that after the drainage peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it exists inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack the weapons and to protest against their rights, and that is fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore, we call all the defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong - above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifice, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you fly?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for safety reasons, I do not want to reveal their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without writing without me, without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast it into the rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't think about, you would be in security, just because you have left the land? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"but we do not talk about the gender equality, but this is a tabular theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukashenian elements are still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, this spiritual barrier I can't overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually give effort to look like the person that she reminds himself of her past - thus to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the needed information I needed about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who have saved one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan not people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock out a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"in order that I mean, they probably invite the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require a proof that the so-called" honor "through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are even now also gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there was just not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then above all those who have no rich relatives, or who were dropped by their relatives were dropped to Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are being held there, so that they can present them later than terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, you will show off their bodies on TV and claim, they would have attacked either a village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people have not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged into itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only one presumption or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I quote someone who was imprisoned in Argun in a half and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">"he says that many people disappeared in this prison, after their beard had grown."</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new about them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"but until now, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports yet. we suggest that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"why otherwise, one would not have allowed these people to shave?"</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I believe that in 2003 I was already known quite Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia has originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil society" "but in the end it has finally thrown back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this under the sharia law possible?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were atoned; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube for jeans and short loops. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The security of the Sharia has never bent to me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny, there was a place where every night, especially at weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechnya language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "do not complain about the misfortune of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it often says to children, if they make things funny about sick."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed before you, because they believed you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never hunted me before never hunted and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace hold time?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow stood on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak on morals."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not speak about us, but primarily on the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel like the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who previously smiled and smiled, viewed you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the period I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel like the situation in the Republic was rising steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, merges, I grasped them to hospital and help them to get Essential modes."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not long cents for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I dissect the sanctuary.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear one mistake?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"this is the nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"that is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth, that there are no bumps with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the Kabardiner which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet, they are - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I am from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, going into the mosque and during the Ramadan, live together with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think of transitions to men, the men love, and they believe that you are moving his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a failure."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be accurate, different ways of life."</seg>
<seg id="2391">"for me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not ashamed of my body."</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I will be personally personally but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2410">"Arab ancestors suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where most of the Arab-Nazi community is located in the Arab Ahwazi community, has been troubled by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult to deny the native Arab population."</seg>

<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion which was written by Ayomide Lasi, and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions, in which many different positions expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminists and why we generally should be all feminism *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today still earn less money than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women still stand under strict observation when it comes to what they may do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women arrive sooner or later in various areas of life to a smooth blanket, and discrimination based on sex still attracts across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I am double and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to talk about skin color, in racism, on black hair-women, on black transitions, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, when I speak, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to uplift" their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualised violence an institutionalised form of racist violence, we are exposed to black women at two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"or above that black women and women of other ethnicities and cities of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girl and girls with a migration background often referred to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women are exposed in black spheres and women with a migration background to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand I will, that all women, all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join the black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refused to consider injustices in their thinking, which relate to the gender and the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Soaring himself complained in her speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and also I refused to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is in historical sense an evil and marginalised being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I want to join the groupings that are also absorbed by cultural appropriation of our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to put white women out the importance of overcutting of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different homes, and borders themselves from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I draw it before, to release me completely and entirely by feminism, which was brought to life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of stubborn for a white-feminist paradigm that is so stubborn, that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important now than ever, that we define black women to us according to our own ideas and set ourselves into the sphere that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana (about: Africa-Womanismus (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) that we can defend ourselves in this way, and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanist environment I can uplift black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I shall be recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in his church.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weighting) that reports about the violence of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names have been amended to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"police Commissar told Ada Báez, that they had nothing against Luis Balbuena, their exporters who had become violent-violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship has passed some time and the police said, her statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as a further wife Balbuena due to abuse, also the acoustic display of Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved their ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"when women refunding the display at all, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who mists them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence at all in case of law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">Content 1 beats and Statistiken2 Unvisible abuse and a legal system that has nothing under-mmt3 Paraguay legislation: good approach to defective implementation of bats and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women really are misled, says Myrian González, research scientist for Genderask at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are different information and reports that don't even show the amount of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the numbers available are very alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Prosecutor's Office there were 9600 ads for domestic violence. at 70% of it all went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the adverts in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There have been more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace. here also 86% of the indicators came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mistic, 55% of women spoke of psychotic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics however do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women's Minister in Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed." on every woman, which will be reimbursed in Paraguay due to psychical abuse notification, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman, which are refunded because of body abuse, two women who do not do this," they declared it at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not their own crimes, the law enforcement authorities cannot be documented adequately, how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">Alone to August 2016 enumerated journalists at least 12 cases of women's involvement in the country alone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates a woman dies in Paraguay every ten days due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called her the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't really want it, but after all, but after all, this should be repented for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and not with Carlos together. but two years now, she bore the mental violence against women - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time most recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never thought that I would be the victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only women happen to be underestimated, because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote posts on Facebook, in which she described his insults and different attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had insulated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people replied on their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen so long from Carlos, and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse, at least a certain complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner become her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychotic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"their affluent partner finally managed to convince them, that she was worthless."</seg>

<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"for the need to run on site medical research, there are two reasons: for a lack of global health system many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a major problem in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is conducted by African scientists themselves, while building its own research capacity in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with lab tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only set solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this must change, otherwise we will always remain beneficiary instead of being makers of themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>

<seg id="2610">The projects are very well encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or come here, because the funding and development prospects are better in other countries."</seg>

<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa towards Western countries based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" "open source" "seed producers change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this entry of Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions to environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has grown in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 sorts, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronomers in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for nearly 20 years, Morton's work was only given by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salts can get, boundaries."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the early 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented and that it was therefore not able to use them further for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents gold not only for individual varieties, but also for specific characteristics such as resilience over diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been filed on more and more plants like cereals or cartels. due to these trends there is plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security around the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of ancient tradition, Morton still holds salad, but he needs for this longer time, since its work is becoming more and more difficult for its work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if a river would lie in a river a rock brock, in order to paddling the paddling."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we must do that now, but it is a break with the tradition of breeding," he says. "I think that these patents go on Salads too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand in court, no one can breed any new lettuaries, because all the features are patented. so he is doing as good as possible and tries to draw up those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material being protected as a intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that becomes ever greater in the US and all over the world: open source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the international space station ISS have red red Roman salat of the variety of reddish in the "greenhouse" of the station "bred and eaten. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that, as the movement from the IT sector would come and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open-Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" "open source" software, "providing alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and -gens are not protected as intellectual property, and thus can be used permanently for plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, in short Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit to that other seeds can use seed freely."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breed their seeds, as well as prescribed immediately - two aspects that have been prohibited or prescribed by many plants."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeder and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor of University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seed and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, seed plays an important role in larger groups such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by raising seed with natural resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasises that the" "open source" "movement does not work with GM plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, made in ecological agriculture or Monsanto and Bayer, who are increasingly popular in August or September 2016." those who want to buy good, local and sustainable, producing vegetables, should also know that the way is bred based on how this vegetables is bred. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">"dietary sovereign, without seed sovereign, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to provide others with seeds as well as to patent its action in contrast, seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of the food supply is at risk, as the available pool is due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on the plant material, which is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has dealt with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. it found out that about a third of all cardboard features is protected as intellectual property, whereby it is not only usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suggests that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are cultivated so bred that they have specifically desirable characteristics - of such, through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they flourish in certain environments and to resist threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available crop material for breeder is decreasing due to ever more patents. genetic diversity is currently unnecessary, but ever since the changed conditions caused by climate change are far worse."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto Speaduto recognise that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four genders and cooperation with institutions such as the State Department of the United States, the company is preparing for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property restricts other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant variations. "" a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent is expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions can help others come to the same result with another method."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent difference, is certainly not a innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait such a long time to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one should have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a general public and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it is impossible to make us use of the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes with the concept to patented, plant characteristics:" we did not really create the features. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants grow themselves and as breeders we have no clue how the plants do.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US-state Oregon and Ossi-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "whoever inspires its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with big courtyards and monocular architectures, for their cultivation, herbiwise herbicide, who grow in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just fine. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such as Monsanto are patents), but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are patents, they create the majority of smaller seed companies - either they refuse the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent seed-maker Frank Morton seeks out in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder's breeder by the prevention of plant patent innovative would:" it looks like I am with my efforts to produce new, stronger than a company that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalog, as I know my competitors will sell my varieties in a couple of years themselves," he says. "with a patent you are only 20 years before competition, which makes it very easy for me to make it very beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading in the" "open source" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which itself describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, an" open source "plant breeding program works with farmers, helping them to breed new varieties, meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" open source "seed, and to sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, plus the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive Board of the European Union, the European Commission, explained that conventional bred plants should not be patented. this makes it possible to oppose the current practice of the European patent office, the patents on conventional bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States, the patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organised a conference to" open source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for" "open source" "seed systems that the organization currently establishes a worldwide alliance for" "open source" "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development aid organisation USC Canada and the Action group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of the food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, and others - a report published on seeds, to exchange and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also stressed the importance of a varied, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection, by which Luby von Ossi hopes to see him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food is above all ensured, where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role", "so Luby." we now try to make people clear that there is even more behind their foods. "</seg>

<seg id="2722">"this time, it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnists."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"on the weekend at the 05.August, the Egyptian government has reported the website of the" Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which reported human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported via selects. "</seg>
<seg id="2724">"in August, the network released a comment on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticized this step sharply and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region."</seg>

ANHRI is confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to imitate it. we insist that we continue to fulfill our task."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities block up to 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-speaking issue of Huffington Post, and the Qatar coming network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support from terrorism.

<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the spread of columnists and articles that he does not write to accessible websites and media in Egypt.</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, who is also home to a ziadas blog, but on the other hand is more accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity, after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards and recorded a video, like the police of bodily violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article focuses primarily about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada expressed himself to the block through the government and reflected, what this means to him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the, blogs to block is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfat.The al-Sisi - and even if the block of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the feeling of a siege governing board; a arrest, a attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the block blogs as well as any other website, for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) They proved that I was not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06. August 133 web pages. this took technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provider (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"AFTE documented also the locking of vendors, possible through the circumference of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the block of websites, the VPNs started."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the intention of the government to further block content and filter to the Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation will additionally be concealed that the censored decisions behind closed doors are made, thus the Egyptian population has no legal basis, helping them to proceed against this action."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censorship and whom will attack them next?</seg>

<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, he argues the journalist of Cecília Oliveira that force violence as a" war "." this is the opinion of a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to account responsibility in the police.
