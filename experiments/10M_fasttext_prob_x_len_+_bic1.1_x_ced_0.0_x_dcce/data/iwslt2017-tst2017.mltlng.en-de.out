this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times .
&quot; long before someone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , wrote a book in which he spectac@@ ularly released that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
&quot; but it is another chapter , which should leave a lasting impression . &quot;
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter does not exist ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for nearly 10 years , the government was determined against ra@@ ids and urged him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to use this right , when media cannot get this information and if the identity of the mu@@ te cannot protect them . &quot;
&quot; so when the government was standing at R@@ isen , he did something what many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused , and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although she has for years details that it would be vital for her case , the demands of the government were dropped on a rat . &quot;
the reason : in the period of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters can always be less hiding .
&quot; rather than to fail and lead to the statements , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ator , without permission , his telephone calls are secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit ratings , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Ster@@ ling , a CIA wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens are alleged to judge . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised at his trial , wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to protect . but instead the judiciary has more condem@@ ning than all U.S. governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to a journalist .
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more possibilities to pick up all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows to cope with the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they are able to contact the moment in which they are in contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in the testimony . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which there was not yet been written as ar@@ isen his book , and it is much more secure than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source code system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous , which was originally developed by us from Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents to or send information , as in any common contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot provide any more information secretly , and many of the information they would request would not be available . &quot;
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world continue to develop new es@@ par@@ rot technologies that may je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is up to us to make sure that not only technology @-@ denomin@@ ator such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to use Mis@@ set@@ ters . it &apos;s just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wer , &quot;
&quot; who will report on abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals . or the next environ@@ ment@@ alists , the alarm for contaminated water by F@@ lin@@ t suggests . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider who warned us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the greatest datas@@ he@@ ck of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; dis@@ closes that Rei@@ che and mighty &#93; &#91; do &#93; &#91; what does it mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ata Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ ILL have hiding an explanation . &#93; this week we have been written by messages about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the Swiss Law@@ yers Fon@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publishing of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad @-@ Assad has in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting for the next release , and the next revealed documents . &quot;
now this sounds like the plot of an agency &apos;s agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems to be crying away from you , to me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address this ?
&quot; but the truth is , if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global W@@ ILL , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax hav@@ ens are used by a few of them to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal something for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will be very confusing all over the world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ ch@@ ap .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is . &quot;
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably , because there were no prominent Americans now that appeared in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by the principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming , or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states it needs less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school quarters to cut school children .
&quot; it has allowed sc@@ ams , especially in random investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global W@@ ould we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks .
how does it work ?
&quot; so , we sent a covered investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator came from African ministers , who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht to buy a private jet . &quot;
&quot; shocked us , that all of us made a lawyer from our investigations , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all preliminary meetings . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course anyone was handed over to it . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as individual cases .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has made suggestions for our co@@ vert inquiries . &quot;
it is not about a single leader who is involved in a sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to tackle this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very dull , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had changed , as if it is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see that quite a lot has started to change . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years we have seen much more transparency , which concerns the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU captured in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally . &quot;
for us at Global W@@ ILL this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who get mad , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypo@@ crit@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy to get up and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a leading politician who recognize the problem and use it to terminate this type of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can end the lack of transparency , which now allows this kind of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was nearly kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red ma@@ z@@ est that would have landed . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy was standing in the red ma@@ Maz@@ da and looked forward to my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made just a road trip throughout the country . afterwards he would go to peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where sleeps you now night ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I do not know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , Man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I will not kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have a air mattress . you can sleep in my living room .
&quot; said one voice in my head : &quot; &quot; h , how to please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was in bed , I star@@ ed at the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get out of myself ? &quot;
a game @-@ foreign sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on Zeh@@ en@@ cro@@ ok to the door and shut down my sleeping room door . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork that he had bought from me , is now hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my point of view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners , actually friends who just waited to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate attracts , and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can make it to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I overwhelmed how we could make some things . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &apos; air mattress and Breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ et@@ ts tasted completely different because we made it for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we had passed our last guests and the door into the castle fell , star@@ red Brian and I remember . &quot;
had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and we could pay our hire at the same time ?
things came to the roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you come . &quot;
over the internet they can then invite to a wild man to stay with them .
&quot; this will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited that the missi@@ le would ign@@ ite .
&quot; indeed , they do not . &quot;
&quot; nobody who is still at comfort at comfort , would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we have learned to be children that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; when you have a problem , you bes@@ ts yourself on the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie , we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create confidence through the design of immense confidence between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford something ?
is it possible to create confidence with design confidence ?
&quot; I want to give you a precious sample , what degree of confidence we asp@@ ed . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your phone into your hand .
&quot; now , I would like to unlock your mobile phone . &quot;
give your rel@@ inqu@@ ish phone to your left bank money .
&quot; this silent way of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time the door . &quot;
&quot; the only thing that is more personal than your cell phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the bul@@ war@@ ped cell of a stranger in your hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
so most of the guests feel when they sleep elsewhere .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ ner &apos;s cell phone now ? &quot;
could you announce on Twitter that he has run for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
you now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail at this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had only once presented with his name ; if he would have told wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 respon@@ dents , all say : &quot; &quot; he can really very well ent@@ ail mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ conceived feedback system strengthens the trust .
at the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their management departments before we set them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how similar they are about age and dwelling place . &quot;
&quot; little unexpected , we trust the people most , who are most similar . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ bi@@ dity .
exciting becomes it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by Be@@ ur@@ rection .
if one has fewer than three ratings . nothing changes .
&quot; but you have more than ten , changes everything . &quot;
a good reputation is com@@ mon@@ alities .
so the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; furthermore , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can see . &quot;
here you can see the response to the first message of a guest .
&quot; when one tells too little , such as &quot; hi ! &quot; , you do not get an answer . &quot;
&quot; for example , one tells a lot , such as : &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holidays . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
&quot; we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text , we also give tips on which topics should be written . &quot;
&quot; our whole company relies on hope that the right design can help , overcome our prejudices against foreigners . &quot;
&quot; with which we had not expected , the large amount of people who were more than willing to dis@@ solve these prejudices . &quot;
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a need which had not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business is just very good .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed parties to have celebrated or ap@@ partments .
hosts have guests in the rain .
&quot; at the beginning of the project , I worked with customer service in customer service . all calls came directly to my cell phone . &quot;
I stood on the front line when confidence has been broken .
there is nothing more lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that we hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , there was only a fraction of the 123 million nights only one fraction ever had one problem . &quot;
for people trusted each other to law .
&quot; when confidence works , it can be discer@@ n@@ able . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack .
his hosts took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his judgment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to ar@@ dent activities to heart ar@@ ctic .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ections that have saved a life , even though they don &apos;t know one at all . &quot;
&quot; they drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by way . &quot;
they can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay runs off . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure financial transaction are just what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled about this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is about an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now simply to call &quot; &quot; rent industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
&quot; Share Economy describes a trade , the human relationships promises . &quot;
&quot; people set up a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , this is compared with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but therefore less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you have visited , a group there would be waiting to fill a group there , and show a while in a pub / pent@@ ine district of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef ?
these days , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would like to shape apartments of reason to work together ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , rather than lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government . &quot;
&quot; now the residents were offered . students , who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were taught in people whose children were brought out . there were In@@ cub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy , our platform alone will be hosted by night 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries at a stranger , or even a host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as it has been brought to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality there was also previously .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why has just our works ?
&quot; aside from luck and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deeper prejudices .
&quot; I find this amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
&quot; I must think every time , when a red Maz@@ da drives me past . &quot;
we know of course that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think of when you look at me ?
a faithful ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , subjected to bra@@ in@@ washing , a terror ? &quot;
or just a delay in the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak with their u@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , It is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee shop -- double es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ er @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Mus@@ lim@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sing , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ten me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as homo@@ sexuality , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ in . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab to carry my head coverage . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you oppressed yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the winner was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , and indeed on the pressure I felt as 17 years old , to adapt to a perfect and un@@ touch@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have ended with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought out , asked questions , doub@@ ted and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was a trust and slow dedication to deep@@ ened with every reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone truly understands you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later I had , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian Dream &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had folded to the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; E@@ il@@ let &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , aircraft flo@@ wn in buildings , people sp@@ ran@@ gen from the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock changed quickly in outra@@ ge .
why should you do something like that ?
&quot; I moved the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country attacked , but in the N@@ u the actions of others led me from a citizen into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and begin with the studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I drove up -- when we drove away - so deep it went into my seat , and I was afraid to become known as Mus@@ lim@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; we moved this night into our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d careful , &quot; &quot; lead in well illuminated areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ vel@@ v@@ elt you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of the coverage .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard about attacks on the Muslims or the people that one held for Muslims , to st@@ war@@ ped free and struck . &quot;
there was really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because the people who have attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have swe@@ pt the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions I love issues .
accus@@ ations are the accus@@ ations which are hard .
nowadays we can actually say people say : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go on ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
it is only the question : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know that there is a mal@@ ignant tum@@ our as a whole and a ben@@ ign tum@@ our only keeps watching .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , the sth@@ and and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques to make America more secure ?
&quot; there may be a few parking spaces , but not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other fai@@ ths , and to show greater citizen participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a head of the police in the Washington , DC recently told , people are actually not being radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has found that it begins online . as a first the person is cut off from her church , even by her family , so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ sc@@ ure their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we need to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS justified its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as Mus@@ lim@@ in , as Mother , as Man , I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
yet we would add to their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology reasons on their &quot; Holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a glance on them , she is not pushing her what she will be in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that she can read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she spoke , she brought to the silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alisation through extremis@@ ts that promised its solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m re @-@ established the connection with God and her church .
&quot; rather than acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; when learned in the mosque , they kept before the IS . &quot;
that was an insight as to the Islam@@ ophobia and my family is concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we tend to accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; one study shows : if you have reports to a review , a negative impact on Muslims has reported a negative attack on Muslim countries and circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims came to ri@@ oss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terror attacks .
it happened in advance of the Ira@@ k@@ war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to minimize the foundation of free society , the sensible and well informed citizen . &quot;
the handling of Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear ign@@ ites us all . &quot;
in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism it is not just about having to explain itself .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was engaged in the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me , that he was the sweet@@ est , generous man whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a young man become a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne in her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an that was in the afternoon to visit . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he sha@@ oss eight times in De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism cannot be fatal but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or we were safe at home ?
&quot; we possessed it and for us it was no easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove back , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out of my shoes , went into the prayer of prayer , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then , the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thanks and welcomed our guests , because half of the gathered together Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who had come to join us , but to teach us . &quot;
in that moment I broke down .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ concep@@ tions .
what will you choose ?
what are you choosing at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you go on number safe ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks nice !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have met a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding an TE@@ D@@ Talk , work a thin@@ ker in drau@@ ght , in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you . I am absolutely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am usually as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; if you look at Muslims around the world , and I did it with the greatest ever performed study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
they want prosperity for the family they want to work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no sense an exception .
&quot; if people appear like an exception to the rule , then usually the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for cra@@ fting , is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial ron@@ es . it is possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air par@@ cel@@ ing in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air@@ ings in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 to bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by connecting you achieve flight , high speed and speed up to narro@@ west space . &quot;
you can also build on self @-@ resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to carry the loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order that a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an en@@ ching of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest image . for example &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a plane , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other star@@ ppers , it is efficient in advance flight efficiently , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and thus has large advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a downside .
a limitation of cr@@ eck@@ star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence like wind arches .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the airplane doesn &apos;t matter in what location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often introduce basic abstract questions to penetrate the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; for example , such a question would be : what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which conver@@ ged to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , semi @-@ controlled air @-@ controlled aircraft were able to fly , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ oring . &quot;
&quot; long , we discovered that flies with only one works . &quot;
this is the mon@@ e@@ inner that is the mechan@@ ically easiest way of flight . it was invented in front of a short way .
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cros@@ ru@@ des , no further adju@@ sting or controllers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , happens in the inside very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it exactly when all to watch , is small , therefore I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ e@@ inner is a exercise in pleasures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ell@@ ors , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symm@@ et@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , he is ambi@@ valent in his orientation . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he receives the proper skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is filmed or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly in flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see you this .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this turns into clo@@ ck@@ wise
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they act like an high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , a bit wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly , albeit limited . &quot;
&quot; we will now demonstrate that , by making a half flight air@@ worthy . &quot;
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; large number of autonomous , co @-@ ordin@@ ated units allow a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took negoti@@ ators Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than a sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms . &quot;
&quot; each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled , therefore there is no upper limit . &quot;
hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe engine up there would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types like us the wage is in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a memory of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures , to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy , two black holes are getting faster , you turned into pure energy in a tenth of ten@@ ths in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment it shines brigh@@ tly as all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy has been handed down into the space of time fabric and the universe is explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events initially .
a total of 1.3 billion years ago was the case of multi @-@ zel@@ liges life on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ er , man and -- God stand up with us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly courageous -- R@@ ai We@@ iss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which are approximately through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
the majority held them crazy .
&quot; but enough people realized it as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the U.S. National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely much hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ Inter@@ fer@@ om@@ atic @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following times , the precision of LIG@@ O could substantially increase the output power increased enormously . &quot;
that is why one calls him now Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O started to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the det@@ ector , rou@@ ded the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my do@@ d@@ ill father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all this , what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ist at MIT . he studied gra@@ vit@@ ational signals from black holes and their through observ@@ atories such as LIG@@ O measurable signals . what are the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ wning in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction , and in the other winding . &quot;
to illustrate do@@ ers in courses to rel@@ ativity theory often a properly al@@ ber@@ ing dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each one of us was stretched out when the waves are stretched and stretched . the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 nuts after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 performer , explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear tank . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text by gravity
&quot; described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of LIG@@ O , hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
but physic@@ ists are fin@@ der@@ ous and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles .
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more a ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial traits , the size of your mobile phones . &quot;
this is quite practical . for so you can make an image or a map of things by showing the light of one of the points coming around you .
the sounds are different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we are looking for specific properties like clay and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , she speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob inter@@ rup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot produce simple pictures of objects in all of them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least lying for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we transform our wave pattern in all , we can literally speak the All literally . &quot;
&quot; the grav@@ itation to listen , can tell us about a collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has worked very long . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , non @-@ rot@@ ten holes , cir@@ cus simple : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very fast as you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional ton@@ ic change . that sounds like Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu !
&quot; it is a kind of movement , engra@@ ved in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to : &#91; Sur@@ ren@@ des noise &#93; jem@@ and , who knows what he must hear , recognize this as a sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun@@ clay , which turns around as fast as the rods of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s briefly think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces before .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding importance of LIG@@ O .
&quot; LIG@@ N leads an entirely new way to study the universe , as it never was possible before . &quot;
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the universe and the invisible . &quot;
much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mask @-@ stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about them .
&quot; but the exciting physical processes are happening , but at the core , which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through as this op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would never see the first minutes of aging , but we will never see them since the urine is covered by its own night@@ light . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and that most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we have no idea of what we just discover , by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in the first attempt things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this subject : Me : the kind of stars , which produce black holes , like LIG@@ O they are observed are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
they are enormous ; ancient bodies of prehistoric times . black holes are so to speak to us the Sau@@ ds for our arche@@ ological work .
&quot; in this way , LIG@@ N makes us an entirely different angle on the events of all , to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we left out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge is now to be as bold as possible .
thanks to LIG@@ O we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and zir@@ cons of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I plan to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : just to do that , before I feared , it removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; keep my fear , speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff , weg . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , that my life deeply changed , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls for un@@ expl@@ ain@@ able reasons all &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she was a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; estim@@ ating , I need milk for my beak @-@ beak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new attitude to my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them , as soon as you call me up . no matter what I do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking effect of side effects : only recently , I actually understood that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; sa@@ ws to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author &apos;s car . I think things out , do you want to live . &quot;
dream@@ job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream@@ job .
I Cre@@ ire television . I love television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV @-@ season , I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours to go into the world . &quot;
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each show offers hundreds of jobs , which not existed before . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ casting can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars television , four broad@@ casts , which are simultaneously in production , four episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 70 hours &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday evening .
all over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I myself have created , and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV@@ s , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world . &quot;
do you know who makes it still ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream@@ job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say it to you , so all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a classroom , take a deal seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just get on the computer jumping and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not at a dream@@ job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
I &apos;m working hard and I love it .
&quot; when I go into the work , there is no other sense . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
&quot; it is when I put troops on , when m@@ old I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a result , there is a high tone , there is a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , stren@@ uous and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me if the work is running well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz h@@ ears as a busy road , I could go on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people take in , when I declare to them the buzz , that I am writing to me that writing is joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , this does it . &quot;
&quot; but the buzz -- when I began working with television production , when I began working and work , build and working together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . the buzz ! &quot;
the buzz is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of God is the voice of my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , you cannot do any other than their size . &quot;
&quot; feeling not to be different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what is called the buzz .
or perhaps it also means a work@@ a@@ holic to be .
maybe it is called genius .
maybe it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear one : the more successful I will , the more shows , the more surplus borders , the more work there are , the more things simultaneously , the more I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , the I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the tot@@ als .
am I only this buzz ?
and then the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ claimed , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the buzz stops .
&quot; now , my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working institute . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; my mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the buzz heard . &quot;
the buzz of the engine was pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the buzz did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours , finished weekends , no re@@ mor@@ ing , nothing deleg@@ ating , a titan@@ ium doesn &apos;t exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan ,
&quot; everything was gray , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what makes you do , if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; ha@@ ze yourself from , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you work , you can be doing a teacher , a painter who knows a teacher , a painter who knows how to feel the buzz , when the buzz stops , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart ceas@@ es , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
&quot; and then my &quot; &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; a question . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way home , late and she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no more than I am aware of two things :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , they called me not &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot; &quot;
they call no longer &quot; estim@@ ating . &quot;
when is this happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan , and my sums , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; Mama , Do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read more dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing unusual .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in the sol@@ itude and in the absence of the Sum@@ mer@@ it , I cannot do anything except . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , the I run , the army , the canvas , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , guard and the song in which it can let go , or whatever the girl goes to &quot; &quot; The Eis@@ aj@@ gin &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and an energy balance comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is silent , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
but a buzz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay in the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the tot@@ ality , the working environment , the titan@@ ium , which is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself using broad@@ casts and television hours , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz . &quot;
&quot; the buzz is not a power , and it is not work @-@ specific . &quot;
it is dependent on joy .
the real buzz is dependent upon the love .
&quot; the buzz is the current , which comes from my lust . &quot;
the real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; true buzz ignor@@ es the pressure of the story , the anticip@@ ating tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real buzz is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pering me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am an Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I make this a fixed rule so that I can free myself as a work@@ a@@ holic from any fault .
&quot; it is a law , I have no other choice . I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; playing with me is not in a different way , like working . &quot;
&quot; truth is hur@@ ting , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer a work at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this entrance is painful , because what a person would rather work than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan , &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we dis@@ bur@@ sting soap .
&quot; I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always get back to my cell phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how you live , and the buzz of the universe fills me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why have we stopped playing with the games ? &quot;
you can also say it ! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you keep me for na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; probably you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et @-@ show figure .
you will find your child less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me , until they under@@ pin that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ äfer or K@@ eks replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more need it not . &quot;
everyone can raise 15 minutes on the piece even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes on the piece !
&quot; no cell phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinners , the children bed @-@ finished . &quot;
but 15 minutes are possible !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . there must not be the children . it is true to feel the buzz , to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy , &quot;
to &quot; play &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it out .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I swe@@ eping and I si@@ ege . friends meet , books reading the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is just for everything I gave up , when I got my first TV show , when I got a Titan in the apprenticeship , when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on the piece , why not get a total of 15 minutes ? &quot;
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens in my office and I find myself in my office . I hear a unknown melody , it ful@@ fills me and my soul . I love me to new ideas . the buzz of the tot@@ ality of the buzz . I use it to the ful@@ lest and love my work . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz , the sums it is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap @-@ blowing and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the buzz of Life .
the buzz of love .
&quot; the buzz of work is part of me , but just a part . and therefore I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is a sn@@ ap that I am a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and play more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my warehouse is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the more happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land , which I have , the marathon , which I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this buzz , the more this unusual , genuine , naked and new life @-@ feeling inside me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this buzz , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am writer . I think things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream@@ job should be a little dream@@ y .
I said yes &quot; to less work and play more games .
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am surgical treatment of surgery .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from one second to the other , after a serious stroke , or a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low capability for self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a sustained , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; sure , they have heard from one of the most famous , the &quot; &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation &quot; . &quot; the electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so much that the neurological function improves . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered under severe tre@@ mb@@ ling and heavy pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ curing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
&quot; I would like to show you , that we are very close . &quot;
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior vice @-@ doctor and worked every day and night in the emergency .
often I got patient with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a the brain @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers and the skull @-@ pressure increase .
to save life is to dimin@@ ish the skull pressure .
you sometimes need to remove a part of your brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing the sha@@ ken brain mass , we decided to analyze with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue , comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; one has to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that is precisely what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials there was Jean @-@ François .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise to us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with big green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the bi@@ ologi@@ an education that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into every cell ty@@ p of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
&quot; it is surprising to preserve this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP . &quot;
we made a further fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
&quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot;
but these cells keep different .
they slowly shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but differ differently . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the completion of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe they will take part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations in brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to find a piece of brain , from the non @-@ speaking area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François &quot;
and they are then colour@@ able to be able to trace them in the brain .
in the last step we planted them at the t@@ aps of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transp@@ l@@ ant -- Aut@@ otran@@ sm@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we sc@@ rub@@ bing these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we pl@@ ush the same cells into bra@@ in@@ dent brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with ape . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we planted cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that after a couple of weeks they completely disappeared as if they were removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not disappear there so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we used an injury to and honour exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could watch under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been pl@@ ast@@ ed .
&quot; evidence to show them are these little points . these are the cells we f@@ aint in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
&quot; so , we are trained monkeys with a manual de@@ port@@ ance task . &quot;
they had to take food pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very good .
&quot; when they had reached a stable game of skill , we ate the hand@@ mot@@ ic field in the mot@@ ic Cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; as ther@@ eu@@ pon , the apes were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in people , they recovered spontaneously to some degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed , and then try to recover with the help of plastic mechanisms . they recover at a certain level , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkey , which recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury to injury .
he is not so accurate and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we pl@@ ump the cells : the same monkey , two months after the plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results .
since that time we found out much more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use it later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ pl@@ ish them with people .
I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself .
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I am sure right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who need it . &quot;
I definitely recommend .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable that the brain is very delicate etc .
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and a fast professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : looking into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multi@@ centric study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is certain of course . J@@ B : natural .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality , but as the inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable texture .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and its large im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have doubt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic .
&quot; indeed , democracy is overcome by us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clearly stated that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Ascen@@ ded friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group of a dis@@ belief , we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a percep@@ tive and anti @-@ democratic democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are measured , our future is dark , and our great , new technologies wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently being threatened our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin &quot; Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; one summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt @-@ mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognise the debt @-@ mountain , &quot;
but only a few recognize its Twin @-@ Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the high @-@ use as@@ best@@ os and concert which , however , is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income that you need to carry out the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial installations , machinery , office buildings , schools , streets , go@@ ings , equipment , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars sounds after a lot of money , until one compares it with the 5,@@ 1 tri@@ llion dollars , which at the same time locks in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; as a form of debt and non @-@ productive capital form the twin , which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of 25 @-@ 54 years of labour in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest . just like Ö@@ di@@ pus father , who is out of fear , the prophecy of the O@@ ra@@ k@@ el could be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
&quot; un@@ wanted to bring the circumstances causing it , that wast@@ es kill him . &quot;
this is my ha@@ ge with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely dev@@ out art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to further improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue . but before we continue : what do we understand in democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed naturally too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; it would be a mistake , however , to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy due to these proportions . &quot;
&quot; the judgment of the Ath@@ en@@ ic democracy was and is that she was involved in the working arms , not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they grant them the right to political co@@ determination with the same voting rights in questions of state budget . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not hold for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which glo@@ wed very bright , it is also quickly hidden . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible , as a complete separation from politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process has been confined to politics while the economy - so the world of corporations -- a democratic @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies has existed since the time when this separation from politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , by the economy gradually under@@ went down the politics and ma@@ ize them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians no longer are as they used to be ?
it is not at a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because it is possible to be in the government today , and still not in power , because the power from politics into the economy is emigr@@ ated and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my ha@@ des with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of predat@@ ors who nour@@ ishes so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which they nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that it is star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy which the policy has so far can@@ ni@@ fied , that it stands out by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods falls , the overall economic demand falls , and the managing director of the corporations are to be frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &#91; the people &#93; from democracy , the higher the twin , and the greater the wast@@ age of human labour power and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back again , and it would be better if the &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; keeps control , just as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
&quot; the teaching of the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain only one position , as in the ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : to create the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ hn@@ sive through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as the economy and politics are separate areas , autom@@ ating the twin summit will be higher , the waste of waste , and social conflicts deeper , just as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ shape the economy and re @-@ establish the areas of economy and politics , and make sure that we reinforce the re@@ united area , otherwise we end in a disease surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; thus , the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth , survive -- &quot;
&quot; the interest@@ ingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or something that the company is in &quot; &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; , &quot; in the machinery , and people put their energy into the research of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we may be optimistic .
&quot; so what is it , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market in which you earn money , while you work and in which your capital follows you from a work@@ site to the next , and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all incomes come from capital and from time , and the concept of wage work is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but who do not work in it , and employees who work there . no exchange rate between capital and labor , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a smooth twin . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , which is spent by the IMF and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest threshold &#93; , in the interest of the entire humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that all world trade in this currency will be tra@@ ded -- we call it &quot; &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that these funds are investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are rare . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference held in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is liber@@ ated at the same time , in which they privileged people preferred , and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ note , global key@@ esi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I have just said , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy ... do we do not , the technological development will generate such a massive decrease in overall economic demand , what Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; due to the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we experience it , it will not only destabil@@ ise our democracies but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; likewise , as Hay@@ ek , which is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also completely enter@@ tainer . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are at ease . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ ling you don &apos;t think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner at the Red@@ ner you have said very clearly what you hold from the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I may say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles today to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; -- Please remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically . &quot;
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ ale , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly skep@@ tical about what democratic development concerns .
&quot; what can be observed now in China , very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China is now propos@@ ing to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y after hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure many list@@ ener curious about your experiences as Minister of Greece in the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I did that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back at the first half of six months later ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to adopt us from the self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the continuous denial made that a massive spread @-@ line by the euro zone ran , and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was revealing this denial -- &quot;
&quot; it is correct to do . unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , continue to have the denial . &quot;
&quot; but you know , what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to maintain a business system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism into life , you might be able to delay a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any ministers , who , after 6 months of ministry , claimed especially in such a tense situation , he claimed no error , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believed there was an honest interest on the pages of the len@@ ders to find a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the obj@@ ectors that were going through the euro zone . &quot;
they did not want to conce@@ de that for 5 years she had a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nom@@ inate GDP .
that is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika creditors , who has imposed on this policy , conf@@ essed : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive table of conversations , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the eurozone is not survived . &quot;
&quot; for if they survived not , the acqu@@ itted tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic for Europe alone but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we set ourselves the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of you have never heard , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 @-@ sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is a manager at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ gs and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , Technology , Tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of the Amazon , the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard working industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IM@@ D@@ b . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received .
&quot; when your show is assessed with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ one , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows to be addic@@ tive , where , after having looked at a season , your brain asks , &quot; Where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows are shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about moving on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to provide &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the middle class , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t know . &quot;
so he must make sure he really is on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a little , therefore Roy Price does not want to risk . &quot;
he wants to make success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch each free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon is in vain , there is nothing to be done correctly ? &quot;
millions of viewers look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when viewing these shows . &quot;
you will be watching by Roy and his team who take everything .
&quot; you record when you start the show when you can see , which parts you ski@@ ps and check once again . &quot;
&quot; they collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show them should be produced . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and from it results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com by four Republi@@ can U.S. Sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average @-@ show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House is at 7.5 -- so on average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews that they give the shows , whose shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to figure out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , what producers , which actors are . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com on four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x made a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; it has two very competitive , data @-@ vers@@ ed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic goes somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if one collects millions of data for a decision that one meets , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
it has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
one optimized it through very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good TV , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so , this is something frigh@@ tening because we &apos;re living in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company , and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is in prison in the US and ask for miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is carried out or not . &quot;
&quot; just as at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , which can be genuine bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always the best results are generated , which is not always the fact that a company like multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data of the most cov@@ eted companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that it is possible to pre@@ dict through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the vi@@ cious way , pre@@ dict -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a big news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year after year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data from listed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors influ@@ encing data zu@@ fici@@ encies in decisions of life -- on the workplace , in the legal framework , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we should rather make sure that data is helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people will use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I have recognized some patterns using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . &quot;
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , you basically do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a comfort you can analyze this problem in its parts , so you can analyze the items ; as a wider set the parts again together to put a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and to understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to restore the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to come back again , even if the information is incomplete -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they have used data and mind wherever they belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their public , which they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts , put together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used to control all their decisions , first as they chose TV @-@ ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say , &quot; &quot; This tells us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool and not to be forgotten , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely , &quot; &quot; exactly here at this moment . &quot;
I will discuss it later with a Techni@@ que .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life until I should listen to the ball in retrosp@@ ect . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more un@@ folded , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; maybe the ball becomes smar@@ ter and smar@@ ter . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data you still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
