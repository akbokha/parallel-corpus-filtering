<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard about Edward Snowden, wrote a book in which he spectacularly released that the NSA heard illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but it is another chapter, which should leave a lasting impression."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter does not exist?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for nearly 10 years, the government was determined against raids and urged him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistle-blowers to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to use this right, when media cannot get this information and if the identity of the mute cannot protect them."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government was standing at Risen, he did something what many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused, and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although she has for years details that it would be vital for her case, the demands of the government were dropped on a rat."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the period of electronic monitoring the reporters can always be less hiding.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rather than to fail and lead to the statements, that could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigator, without permission, his telephone calls are secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit ratings, and even travel-wise with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens are alleged to judge."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised at his trial, whistle-blowers to protect. but instead the judiciary has more condemning than all U.S. governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has too much of their work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more possibilities to pick up all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows to cope with the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in fact, they are able to contact the moment in which they are in contact, rather than in retrospect, in the testimony."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which there was not yet been written as arisen his book, and it is much more secure than regular e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source code system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous, which was originally developed by us from Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents to or send information, as in any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot provide any more information secretly, and many of the information they would request would not be available."</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world continue to develop new esparrot technologies that may jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is up to us to make sure that not only technology-denominator such as Edward Snowden have a way to use Missetters. it's just as important that we protect the next whistle-blower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"who will report on abnormalities in the supply of soldiers and report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmentalists, the alarm for contaminated water by Flint suggests. or a Wallstreet insider who warned us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover crime, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the greatest datasheck of the story was published.] [the" Panama Papers "discloses that Reiche and mighty] [do] [what does it mean?] [we bata Robert Palmer of Global WILL have hiding an explanation.] this week we have been written by messages about a Leck of 11 million documents of the Swiss Lawyers Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publishing of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies like Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin leads to over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are waiting for the next release, and the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency's agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems to be crying away from you, to me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is, if the rich and mighty men are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global WILL, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens are used by a few of them to hide and hide their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal something for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will be very confusing all over the world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matrjochap.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for criminal law and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society really understand what thing is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably, because there were no prominent Americans now that appeared in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming, or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states it needs less information to provide less information to create a company than to get a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school quarters to cut school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has allowed scams, especially in random investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Would we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covered investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator came from African ministers, who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht to buy a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"shocked us, that all of us made a lawyer from our investigations, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all preliminary meetings. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course anyone was handed over to it. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has made suggestions for our covert inquiries."</seg>
<seg id="79">It is not about a single leader who is involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to tackle this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We must change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very dull, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had changed, as if it is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see that quite a lot has started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years we have seen much more transparency, which concerns the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the topic found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a draft law in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the U.S. and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global WILL this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who get mad, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind hypocrites."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy to get up and say," Intransparency is not good for business. "</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need a leading politician who recognize the problem and use it to terminate this type of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can end the lack of transparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was nearly kidnapped and in the trunk of a red mazest that would have landed."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy was standing in the red maMazda and looked forward to my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and made just a road trip throughout the country. afterwards he would go to peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where sleeps you now night?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I do not know yet. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, Man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning. I will not kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have a air mattress. you can sleep in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="112">"said one voice in my head:" "h, how to please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what did I get out of myself? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A game-foreign sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on Zehencrook to the door and shut down my sleeping room door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork that he had bought from me, is now hanging in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners, actually friends who just waited to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time jump, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate attracts, and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can make it to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I overwhelmed how we could make some things. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so 'air mattress and Breakfast "[AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham Omeletts tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them through the whole city. when we had passed our last guests and the door into the castle fell, starred Brian and I remember."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we find new friends and we could pay our hire at the same time?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came to the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a site where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when you come. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the internet they can then invite to a wild man to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"this will be the next big thing!" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the missile would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">"indeed, they do not."</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody who is still at comfort at comfort, would invest in a store that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we have learned to be children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"when you have a problem, you bests yourself on the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie, we had learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create confidence through the design of immense confidence between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design confidence?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I want to give you a precious sample, what degree of confidence we asped."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlock your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your relinquish phone to your left bank money.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent way of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the first time the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only thing that is more personal than your cell phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the bulwarped cell of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So most of the guests feel when they sleep elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gorner's cell phone now?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he has run for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail at this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour had only once presented with his name; if he would have told whence he comes, how his dog or his children?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 respondents, all say:" "he can really very well entail mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-conceived feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had given their management departments before we set them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how similar they are about age and dwelling place."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little unexpected, we trust the people most, who are most similar."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social prebidity.</seg>
<seg id="181">Exciting becomes it when you add the call of a person -- in our case by Beurrection.</seg>
<seg id="182">If one has fewer than three ratings. nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">"but you have more than ten, changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">So the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"furthermore, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can see."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the response to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"when one tells too little, such as" hi! ", you do not get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"for example, one tells a lot, such as:" "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is rather not accepted. "</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, e.g." "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holidays."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">"we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text, we also give tips on which topics should be written."</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company relies on hope that the right design can help, overcome our prejudices against foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we had not expected, the large amount of people who were more than willing to dissolve these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need which had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is just very good.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed parties to have celebrated or appartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">"at the beginning of the project, I worked with customer service in customer service. all calls came directly to my cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood on the front line when confidence has been broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing more limmerit than these calls. it hurts when I just think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that we hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, there was only a fraction of the 123 million nights only one fraction ever had one problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trusted each other to law.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when confidence works, it can be discernable."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His hosts took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his judgment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to ardent activities to heart arctic.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protections that have saved a life, even though they don't know one at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"they drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by way."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without calculate the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay runs off."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure financial transaction are just what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled about this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now simply to call" "rent industry", "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">"Share Economy describes a trade, the human relationships promises."</seg>
<seg id="229">"people set up a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, this is compared with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but therefore less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet from local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you have visited, a group there would be waiting to fill a group there, and show a while in a pub / pentine district of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">These days, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy. "</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would like to shape apartments of reason to work together?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the thoughts of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, rather than loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now the residents were offered. students, who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught in people whose children were brought out. there were Incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share economy, our platform alone will be hosted by night 785 000 people in 191 countries at a stranger, or even a host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as it has been brought to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality there was also previously.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeper prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find this amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">"I must think every time, when a red Mazda drives me past."</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think of when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, subjected to brainwashing, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak with their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, It is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee shop -- double espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchteer-Fitness-fanatikerin, "</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslimine."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sing, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outen me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexuality, as some of my friends, but as Muslimin. I decided to wear the hijab to carry my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you oppressed yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the winner was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and indeed on the pressure I felt as 17 years old, to adapt to a perfect and untouchable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have ended with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought out, asked questions, doubted and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was a trust and slow dedication to deepened with every reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone truly understands you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later I had, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian Dream "." "</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had folded to the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Eillet". ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, aircraft flown in buildings, people sprangen from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock changed quickly in outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the TV channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists "...,..."... in the name of Islam... "..."... "..."... "..."... "..."... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country attacked, but in the Nu the actions of others led me from a citizen into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to move to a new city and begin with the studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I drove up -- when we drove away - so deep it went into my seat, and I was afraid to become known as Muslimine."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved this night into our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard that I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be watchful, "" Seid careful, "" lead in well illuminated areas, "" Vervelvelt you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of the coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard about attacks on the Muslims or the people that one held for Muslims, to stwarped free and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who have attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have swept the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions I love issues.</seg>
<seg id="319">Accusations are the accusations which are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people say: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go on? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It is only the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know that there is a malignant tumour as a whole and a benign tumour only keeps watching.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, the sthand and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques to make America more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking spaces, but not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faiths, and to show greater citizen participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a head of the police in the Washington, DC recently told, people are actually not being radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has found that it begins online. as a first the person is cut off from her church, even by her family, so that the person believes that the person believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abscure their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS justified its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslimin, as Mother, as Man, I believe we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">Yet we would add to their imagination if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku club-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology reasons on their "Holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a glance on them, she is not pushing her what she will be in her" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that she can read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if they had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she spoke, she brought to the silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given sense to their anger, it was a main target for the instrumentalisation through extremists that promised its solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam re-established the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"rather than accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"when learned in the mosque, they kept before the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight as to the Islamophobia and my family is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we tend to accept an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows: if you have reports to a review, a negative impact on Muslims has reported a negative attack on Muslim countries and circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims came to rioss -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times but never in connection with terror attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Irakwar and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulation of the public in order to minimize the foundation of free society, the sensible and well informed citizen."</seg>
<seg id="366">The handling of Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear ignites us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivism it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was engaged in the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me, that he was the sweetest, generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a young man become a sealed young man?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne in her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan that was in the afternoon to visit. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shaoss eight times in Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism cannot be fatal but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or we were safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we possessed it and for us it was no easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat we drove back, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out of my shoes, went into the prayer of prayer, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then, the Imam made an announcement, thanks and welcomed our guests, because half of the gathered together Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come to join us, but to teach us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I broke down.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and preconceptions.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What are you choosing at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you go on number safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>
<seg id="393">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thanks nice!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have met a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">"what started as a platform for crafting, is about to become a billionaire business."</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial rones. it is possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air parceling in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of airings in the Frac Centre in France built a six metre high tower from 1 500 to bricks. a few years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting you achieve flight, high speed and speed up to narrowest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build on self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry the loads to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the potential in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order that a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an enching of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Every flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest image. for example" "start" "and" "land." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a plane, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starppers, it is efficient in advance flight efficiently, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and thus has large advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of creckstarters is that they are sensitive to turbulence like wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airplane doesn't matter in what location the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often introduce basic abstract questions to penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"for example, such a question would be: what is the smaller number of mobile parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for finding the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which converged to hurt you. "</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, semi-controlled air-controlled aircraft were able to fly, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailoring."</seg>
<seg id="435">"long, we discovered that flies with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the moneinner that is the mechanically easiest way of flight. it was invented in front of a short way.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and crosrudes, no further adjusting or controllers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, happens in the inside very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nonetheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailstarters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly when all to watch, is small, therefore I'll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the moneinner is a exercise in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellors, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, he is ambivalent in his orientation."</seg>
<seg id="446">"therefore, he receives the proper skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is filmed or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellors."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly in flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see you this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns into clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they act like an high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, a bit wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will now demonstrate that, by making a half flight airworthy."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"large number of autonomous, co-ordinated units allow a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we took negotiators Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than a slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">"each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled, therefore there is no upper limit."</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe engine up there would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us the wage is in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a memory of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures, to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1,3 billion years ago circled in a very far distant galaxy, two black holes are getting faster, you turned into pure energy in a tenth of tenths in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment it shines brightly as all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy has been handed down into the space of time fabric and the universe is exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events initially.</seg>
<seg id="476">A total of 1.3 billion years ago was the case of multi-zelliges life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, sauer, man and -- God stand up with us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago a group decided to build a particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to search for gravitational-waves, which are approximately through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">The majority held them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people realized it as crazy geniuses, so that the U.S. National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, construction, conception and extremely much hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-Interferomatic-gravitational-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following times, the precision of LIGO could substantially increase the output power increased enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why one calls him now Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO started to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the commissioning of the detector, rouded the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my dodill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all this, what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he studied gravitational signals from black holes and their through observatories such as LIGO measurable signals. what are the gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crowning in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction, and in the other winding."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate doers in courses to relativity theory often a properly albering dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each one of us was stretched out when the waves are stretched and stretched. the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 nuts after the comma, followed by a 1 performer, explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear tank. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text by gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are finderous and with the support of the public will certainly be overcome all obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success. "</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more a ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than things around us: facial traits, the size of your mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical. for so you can make an image or a map of things by showing the light of one of the points coming around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">The sounds are different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean to you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we are looking for specific properties like clay and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, she speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot produce simple pictures of objects in all of them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least lying for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we transform our wave pattern in all, we can literally speak the All literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravitation to listen, can tell us about a collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has worked very long."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotten holes, circus simple: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very fast as you hear the same circus with an additional tonic change. that sounds like Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, engraved in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- listening to: [Surrendes noise] jemand, who knows what he must hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-facher sunclay, which turns around as fast as the rods of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's briefly think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces before.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">"LIGN leads an entirely new way to study the universe, as it never was possible before."</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the universe and the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- virtually or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mask-stars in super-novae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about them.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical processes are happening, but at the core, which is behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through as this opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would never see the first minutes of aging, but we will never see them since the urine is covered by its own nightlight."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and that most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we have no idea of what we just discover, by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, in the first attempt things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this subject: Me: the kind of stars, which produce black holes, like LIGO they are observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous; ancient bodies of prehistoric times. black holes are so to speak to us the Sauds for our archeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">"in this way, LIGN makes us an entirely different angle on the events of all, to the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we left out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge is now to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to LIGO we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and zircons of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"one year I would say to everything" "Yes!" "in front of which I feared."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, me in unpleasant situations, I forced me to say yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I plan to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: just to do that, before I feared, it removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"keep my fear, speeches, my social fear -- Puff, weg."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes, that my life deeply changed, on an unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls for unexplainable reasons all" "estimating" ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she was a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimating, I need milk for my beak-beak."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new attitude to my family. from there I swear to play with them, as soon as you call me up. no matter what I do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking effect of side effects: only recently, I actually understood that the" "Yes" "saws to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author's car. I think things out, do you want to live."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="584">I Creire television. I love television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV-season, I am responsible for bringing about 70 hours to go into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production. "</seg>
<seg id="588">"each show offers hundreds of jobs, which not existed before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcasting can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four broadcasts, which are simultaneously in production, four episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 70 hours"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world run my series in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I myself have created, and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TVs, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who makes it still?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dreamjob.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think if the word" "author" "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, so all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a classroom, take a deal seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I don't just get on the computer jumping and imaginative, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not at a dreamjob."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">I'm working hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I go into the work, there is no other sense."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is when I put troops on, when mold I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, there is a high tone, there is a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, strenuous and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me if the work is running well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz hears as a busy road, I could go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people take in, when I declare to them the buzz, that I am writing to me that writing is joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, this does it."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began working with television production, when I began working and work, build and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzz is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of God is the voice of my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you cannot do any other than their size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling not to be different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means a workaholic to be.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear one: the more successful I will, the more shows, the more surplus borders, the more work there are, the more things simultaneously, the more I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to succeed, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, the I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the totals.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overclaimed, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mother is a single working institute."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," my mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "estimating, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzz heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours, finished weekends, no remoring, nothing delegating, a titanium doesn't exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what makes you do, if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "haze yourself from, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you work, you can be doing a teacher, a painter who knows a teacher, a painter who knows how to feel the buzz, when the buzz stops, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart ceases, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">"and then my" "southern states" waitress "" a question. "</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way home, late and she says," Mama, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no more than I am aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, they called me not" estimating. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They call no longer "estimating."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan, and my sums, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mama, Do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," "Yes." ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read more dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing unusual.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in the solitude and in the absence of the Summerit, I cannot do anything except."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, the I run, the army, the canvas, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, guard and the song in which it can let go, or whatever the girl goes to" "The Eisajgin". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and an energy balance comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is silent, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">But a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the totality, the working environment, the titanium, which is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself using broadcasts and television hours, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz."</seg>
<seg id="707">"the buzz is not a power, and it is not work-specific."</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent upon the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">"the buzz is the current, which comes from my lust."</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"true buzz ignores the pressure of the story, the anticipating tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispering me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am an Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, a lot more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I make this a fixed rule so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any fault.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is a law, I have no other choice. I have no choice unless I want to hear the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"playing with me is not in a different way, like working."</seg>
<seg id="722">"truth is hurting,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer a work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entrance is painful, because what a person would rather work than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We disbursting soap.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always get back to my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how you live, and the buzz of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why have we stopped playing with the games?"</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! they always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you keep me for naïve, for a daydreamer."</seg>
<seg id="742">"probably you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a Muppet-show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">You will find your child less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play at a maximum of 15 minutes with me, until they underpin that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkäfer or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more need it not."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can raise 15 minutes on the piece even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no cell phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinners, the children bed-finished."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are possible!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. there must not be the children. it is true to feel the buzz, to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To "play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I sweeping and I siege. friends meet, books reading the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is just for everything I gave up, when I got my first TV show, when I got a Titan in the apprenticeship, when I wanted to exceed myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on the piece, why not get a total of 15 minutes?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens in my office and I find myself in my office. I hear a unknown melody, it fulfills me and my soul. I love me to new ideas. the buzz of the totality of the buzz. I use it to the fullest and love my work."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sums it is not me... no more. "</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap-blowing and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of Life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of work is part of me, but just a part. and therefore I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is a snap that I am a Titan, I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and play more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my warehouse is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the more happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clearly my head is."</seg>

<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the land, which I have, the marathon, which I run, the canvases, the high tone, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, genuine, naked and new life-feeling inside me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this buzz, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am writer. I think things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dreamjob should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said yes "to less work and play more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am surgical treatment of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from one second to the other, after a serious stroke, or a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low capability for self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a sustained, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"sure, they have heard from one of the most famous, the" "Tiefenhirnstimulation". "the electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so much that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered under severe trembling and heavy pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-curing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">"I would like to show you, that we are very close."</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was senior vice-doctor and worked every day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I got patient with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain traumata the brain-swimmers and the skull-pressure increase.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life is to diminish the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">You sometimes need to remove a part of your brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the shaken brain mass, we decided to analyze with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue, comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"one has to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is precisely what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials there was Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise to us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with big green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the biologian education that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into every cell typ of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">"it is surprising to preserve this kind of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the OP."</seg>
<seg id="832">We made a further fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells keep different.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared slowly and after a couple of weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but differ differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the completion of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe they will take part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations in brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to find a piece of brain, from the non-speaking area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François"</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then colourable to be able to trace them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we planted them at the taps of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- Autotransmtation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we scrubbing these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we plush the same cells into braindent brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with ape."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we planted cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a couple of weeks they completely disappeared as if they were removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not disappear there so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we used an injury to and honour exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could watch under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been plasted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence to show them are these little points. these are the cells we faint in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we are trained monkeys with a manual deportance task."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable game of skill, we ate the handmotic field in the motic Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as thereupon, the apes were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in people, they recovered spontaneously to some degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed, and then try to recover with the help of plastic mechanisms. they recover at a certain level, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkey, which recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so accurate and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we plump the cells: the same monkey, two months after the plantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out much more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implish them with people.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can show you soon as the human brain gives the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I am sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who need it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely recommend.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable that the brain is very delicate etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and a fast professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: looking into the future -- you completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can get into hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select the patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multicentric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is certain of course. JB: natural.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as natural.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that is in reality, but as the inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable texture.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and its large imitators in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"indeed, democracy is overcome by us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unequivocally clearly stated that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- do not influence the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Ascended friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for genuine democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup of a disbelief, we could save ourselves the democracy but that we need a perceptive and anti-democratic democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are measured, our future is dark, and our great, new technologies wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to point out to an interesting contradiction that is currently being threatened our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin" Paradox. "</seg>
<seg id="916">"one summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt-mountain, which throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognise the debt-mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But only a few recognize its Twin-Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the high-use asbestos and concert which, however, is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income that you need to carry out the debt hill and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3,4 billion US dollars have been invested in the US, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial installations, machinery, office buildings, schools, streets, goings, equipment, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars sounds after a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5,1 trillion dollars, which at the same time locks in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"as a form of debt and non-productive capital form the twin, which is not the same by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 years of labour in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low overall economic demand that could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Ödipus father, who is out of fear, the prophecy of the Orakel could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">"unwanted to bring the circumstances causing it, that wastes kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hage with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely devout art. all the unproductive capital should be used to further improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue. but before we continue: what do we understand in democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the free and poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy closed naturally too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"it would be a mistake, however, to reduce the significance of the Athenic democracy due to these proportions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the judgment of the Athenic democracy was and is that she was involved in the working arms, not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which they grant them the right to political codetermination with the same voting rights in questions of state budget."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not hold for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glowed very bright, it is also quickly hidden."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor strengthened, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible, as a complete separation from politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process has been confined to politics while the economy - so the world of corporations -- a democratic-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has existed since the time when this separation from politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, by the economy gradually underwent down the politics and maize them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians no longer are as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not at a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because it is possible to be in the government today, and still not in power, because the power from politics into the economy is emigrated and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators who nourishes so sustainably the animals, of which they nourishes, decimated that it is starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy which the policy has so far cannified, that it stands out by the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods falls, the overall economic demand falls, and the managing director of the corporations are to be frightened to invest the cash of their enterprises."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism distributes the" Demos "[the people] from democracy, the higher the twin, and the greater the wastage of human labour power and prosperity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring politics and the economy back again, and it would be better if the" Demos "keeps control, just as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain only one position, as in the ancient Athens, without creating new forms of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to create the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglohnsive through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as the economy and politics are separate areas, automating the twin summit will be higher, the waste of waste, and social conflicts deeper, just as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reshape the economy and re-establish the areas of economy and politics, and make sure that we reinforce the reunited area, otherwise we end in a disease surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"thus, the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements which he has brought forth, survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the interestingly question is whether capitalism is solved by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix "or something that the company is in" "Star Trek", "in the machinery, and people put their energy into the research of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what is it, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" "matrix" "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of companies, please introduce a capital market in which you earn money, while you work and in which your capital follows you from a worksite to the next, and the company -- regardless of which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all incomes come from capital and from time, and the concept of wage work is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but who do not work in it, and employees who work there. no exchange rate between capital and labor, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a smooth twin."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, which is spent by the IMF and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest threshold], in the interest of the entire humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that all world trade in this currency will be traded -- we call it" "Cosmos", "in units of" Cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the commercial surplus of the country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that these funds are investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference held in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is liberated at the same time, in which they privileged people preferred, and Marxist because it is buried in the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and keynote, global keyesiology."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if something of what I have just said, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy... do we do not, the technological development will generate such a massive decrease in overall economic demand, what Larry Summers is called" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"due to the transfer of this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies but also the countries whose interests in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"likewise, as Hayek, which is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also completely entertainer."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are at ease."</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you are not wirling you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening dinner at the Redner you have said very clearly what you hold from the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I may say that provocative, China resembles today to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- Please remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically."</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberale, like John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly skeptical about what democratic development concerns.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China, very similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"China is now proposing to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy after hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure many listener curious about your experiences as Minister of Greece in the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I did that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back at the first half of six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to adopt us from the self-sufficiency, and the continuous denial made that a massive spread-line by the euro zone ran, and continues to massively threaten the development of the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was revealing this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"it is correct to do. unfortunately, the powers within the Eurozone, within the European group, continue to have the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"but you know, what is coming."</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to maintain a business system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism into life, you might be able to delay a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what change do you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any ministers, who, after 6 months of ministry, claimed especially in such a tense situation, he claimed no error, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>

<seg id="1026">"none of the troika creditors, who has imposed on this policy, confessed:" this was a colossal error. "</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of you have never heard, although he is likely to be responsible for 22-sized minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is a manager at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehogs and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, Technology, Tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and the content of the Amazon, the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard working industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy cannot choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the site IMDb. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review received.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"when your show is assessed with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Throne, "" The Wire "-- all the shows to be addictive, where, after having looked at a season, your brain asks," Where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows are shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about moving on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to provide" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the middle class, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't know."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a little, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to make success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online where they can watch each free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon is in vain, there is nothing to be done correctly?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when viewing these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You will be watching by Roy and his team who take everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when you start the show when you can see, which parts you skips and check once again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"they collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show them should be produced."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and from it results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom by four Republican U.S. Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average-show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House is at 7.5 -- so on average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewer, so the reviews that they give the shows, whose shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to figure out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, what producers, which actors are."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom on four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix made a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" "gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go."</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"it has two very competitive, data-versed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data together and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic goes somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if one collects millions of data for a decision that one meets, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">It has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">One optimized it through very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good TV, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so, this is something frightening because we're living in a time where we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company, and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in the US and ask for missal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge is carried out or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, which can be genuine bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always the best results are generated, which is not always the fact that a company like multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most coveted companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that it is possible to predict through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the vicious way, predict -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year after year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it just didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data from listed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors influencing data zuficiencies in decisions of life -- on the workplace, in the legal framework, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we should rather make sure that data is helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people will use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I have recognized some patterns using the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, you basically do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a comfort you can analyze this problem in its parts, so you can analyze the items; as a wider set the parts again together to put a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and to understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to restore the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to come back again, even if the information is incomplete -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think, Netflix was so successful, because they have used data and mind wherever they belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their public, which they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts, put together and make a show like" House of Cards "" which was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used to control all their decisions, first as they chose TV-ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say," "This tells us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data begin to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool and not to be forgotten, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball ". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you only have to shake the ball to get an answer." most likely, "" exactly here at this moment. "</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will discuss it later with a Technique.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life until I should listen to the ball in retrospect."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more unfolded, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"maybe the ball becomes smarter and smarter. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data you still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
