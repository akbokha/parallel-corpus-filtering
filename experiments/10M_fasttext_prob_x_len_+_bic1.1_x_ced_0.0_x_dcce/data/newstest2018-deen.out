Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that make your look at the city
Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where young people are going to encounter young people .
a greeting chapel , where now is du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn Tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers provide the one @-@ time reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if land cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who has had an exciting time , because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a circum@@ navigation street . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , a offer of Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially when you compare it with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Mün@@ chner Mercury since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you see as such is not equal .
&quot; the great super@@ visor were built for cities and communities with detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets . &quot;
these emerged according to the Bav@@ arian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and jump the first arrest of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army @-@ leader inv@@ aded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War Cri@@ mean War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave an top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns : of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally when the French troops went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbors , which created the idea of a region @-@ wide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische Verwaltung der Management . &quot;
the principal posi@@ tional leaf for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found as any other on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison morning / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 still relatively isolated . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , in the district of Munich . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ mer@@ ing are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : at the first glance , there is a small copy card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written ra@@ ids from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; which was derived from the basic tax . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ser of the plant &quot; land in sun . &quot;
a large green area stands out north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 sw@@ ings of the October October , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the premiere leaf , one reads in the territory of the present district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the street name &quot; &quot; am Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or off the hill &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , you once found people with madness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ zy &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden conducted the institution - that psychiat@@ rist was conducted by King Ludwig &apos;s death in connection with the death of King Ludwig . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; moreover , he allowed the staff to apply to violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; first place for 280 patients was first place , later on 500 places was expanded . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ic@@ um Munich @-@ east since 2006 , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
now on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt can now meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth @-@ house with training courses .
&quot; located west of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of the TS@@ V Munich east , east of the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was placed in an architectural approach to the origins of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , who had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombar@@ d@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ raße called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 had many holes in the city center .
a great one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages were once standing on the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days will be the pre @-@ work and take place on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich @-@ card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
citizens of rights published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the promotion of colorful has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state to Mis@@ sour@@ i .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , who wants to come into force up to 28 August 2017 , invites particular attention to 28 August 2017 , as a number of frag@@ mented , down @-@ based alleg@@ ations in recent times throughout the state and here , it is stated in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently de@@ vised Law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the State , the dis@@ proportion@@ ality of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have wounds of civil rights , the people happen . &quot;
&quot; they will keep up for their skin color , they are put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .
&quot; the group formed incidents like racial distor@@ tions against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the State and was taken into custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of criminals . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General state Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is shown that black motor@@ ists in the state will keep 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel said . &quot;
people need to be ready if there are che@@ ers or let your relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; in 2015 Mis@@ sour@@ i missed 100 hate crime , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking report of the F@@ BI , which represents the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel@@ er is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ law which would make it more difficult , a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil liberties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel warning for Texas and Arizona , issued by the states of immigration legislation that will contribute to local criminal prosecution authorities to grant people because of the AC@@ L@@ U for further growth pro@@ pul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , but lately , stakeholders have used the measure to be responding to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ ler Project is elementary
the Fis@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ fun@@ n project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U @-@ Bundestag Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have presented a picture on site .
&quot; at the rec@@ iter court of the family Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the Fis@@ cal CD@@ U @-@ town met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann gave first insights into his business , in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young animals , and in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este hosts . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter trail for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este exclusively serves region@@ ales .
&quot; since he is also called BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Pis@@ bach , he referred to the Wei@@ ler Project as &quot; spontaneous importance . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green space for a lot of work , much must be processed with the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here fighting with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation , and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ is@@ ers , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ t , and is happy about the leader promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , the farmers need to be supported . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we hope that the for@@ estation of the surface could be gone out for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the greatest treasure that we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make up thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; said the Mayor . &quot;
farmers often stand in criticism because of funding
total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 .
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which will not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders was funded , a quarter carried the municipality of Pis@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers born 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the durability of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphas@@ ised : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ings it does not go . &quot;
also for Peter We@@ iss saw : &quot; the best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land of Land@@ scape ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of past@@ ures .
the goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
prerequisite is the presence of one of the L@@ PR marked .
&quot; in addition , the pat@@ ched surface should not be too n@@ pper@@ able ( H@@ ang@@ Edition over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by dis@@ armament . &quot;
&quot; for the fisheries past@@ ure in 2018 , the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the conservation area corresponds 35 hectares , the low @-@ controlled cost of more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump will take the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is it if they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other , so carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key @-@ ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ regime , knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic A@@ xt in a h@@ it@@ ous dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N on the proposals of the President to the dras@@ tic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t get the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of Bo@@ at@@ owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ers would have absorbed him if he had done it .
&quot; but it resor@@ ted to its significance , and in particular the meaning that you have written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; known as Miller A@@ co@@ sta : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to go here into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom , enligh@@ tened the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is essentially correct , but as it does it itself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the awakened words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your tired , your poor , / your aff@@ licted masses who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; on our monitors was better .
Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he clearly pointed out that these people are not welcome in the USA .
&quot; this conflict , because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict with the significance of America . &quot;
Lazarus and their friends who put themselves on the basis of placing their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it has accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the feminine em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she has a very different name for himself : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that the American flame is going into the surrounding world : &quot; lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
it is intended to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch is not intended to enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something to come across .
the meaning of the statue is quite and certainly a question of point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of men , seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective of which Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever recognise .
&quot; their tor@@ ch is not meant to enligh@@ ten the path , but hatred , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ dh Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two weak@@ ens were included in the UK .
&quot; the Director of the Un@@ ch@@ ant@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member denom@@ ination will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it , until we figure it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - to compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah at the 5.000 m distance , while E@@ ili@@ dh G@@ yle was elected by the crew to the team of team . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; your captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were sho@@ ot@@ table or where ever they live or train , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh very naturally lon@@ ged , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of silver med@@ all@@ ists that will compete in their fifth world Championships on 400 @-@ m @-@ hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 pi@@ ans are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
&quot; over the past year , Mu@@ ir lead on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year . &quot;
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1,500 m runs , is another Scot@@ sman , which is part of a great season that included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle recalls her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was . &quot;
&quot; the Mann@@ er@@ ts captain in says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; in the fact that many of their country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and at the fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; the special thing to be dedicated to team cap@@ tions is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour to know , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise in po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what my speech is concerned as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it , that we are again at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there .
blocking of critics about Facebook : take you not about a public office when you can &apos;t wear the inc@@ ite of voters .
the Father of our country knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers suggested it because of all , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
he sm@@ ashed in criticism of criticism .
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid , and mu@@ te we are led the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work for more than Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ go@@ ose employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and expressed their opinions on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liberties Union compl@@ ained about it at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the governor left the law@@ suit as fri@@ fri@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
&quot; this is a Republi@@ can governor in a overwhelming democratic state , which is amazing . &quot;
he has the highest @-@ highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary Hit@@ z@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary way to combine with his voters and to debate his ha@@ ar@@ eless head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax @-@ Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan Spre@@ ish@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the governor and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ ace@@ ful people , who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , a entrepreneurs and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profound . &quot;
the pastor zi@@ pped the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ go@@ lic faith .
&quot; Law@@ y@@ mi Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not filled , but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news , she wrote in the commentary section of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same theme , then they are recognized as a so @-@ called collective action rather than a large group of affected people . &quot;
&quot; what the Govern@@ ors of the Govern@@ ors as &quot; concentrated &quot; Spam attack &quot; , &quot; other probably would call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a re@@ viewer or deleted a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in previous time , if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical labels and to burn or prot@@ esters prot@@ esters and to silence . &quot;
but this is precisely what happens digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise it that he described Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ as County ver@@ all@@ est the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
at the moment Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect as the internet .
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous mailbox stroke to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous dri@@ lls .
&quot; the people who use pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ iz@@ arius &quot; , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers , who made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and navigation with Great Britain , overwhel@@ m his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not have her silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance club
former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty is hoping for the next three days in domestic comfort since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25 edition of Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led to the Ar@@ cher@@ field links last year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is bound up with the new au@@ c@@ eption in the name of the club and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job than he established this place .
he is a eager supporters of this game and proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales is looking forward to defend a championship for the first time , although he won a career in his 32 @-@ year career for both the European tour and the European Challenge tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels especially true , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was in the year after I had won it , taken out of the program . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year at the European Senior Tour , returns to the action on homeland . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more if you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; glad , I am happy about how it has been gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio on the field the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eil . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six bul@@ lock in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died due to pas@@ se@@ up lung cancer . &quot;
the scientists of the university hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf are coming to this result ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates there are primarily attributed to 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases on pas@@ sers @-@ hand , &quot; &quot; said teacher of Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he received an own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases because of Pas@@ v@@ rau@@ d a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ com@@ partments prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger street are in full swing and , &quot; &quot; admittedly lies in time , &quot; &quot; the head of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of home@@ work , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as in the underground , much ver@@ berge , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always obstruc@@ t the construction work , poses a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red lights and lock@@ out is already huge , &quot; &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for transit .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks dinner they don &apos;t use a stove .
they rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ isters in the un@@ tranquil Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually referred to as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - locally as &apos; not@@ a &apos; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the scar@@ ed tu@@ ber will be taken with di@@ lig@@ ently , washed hands and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay , it does not have furniture - where it also performs its daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a dach@@ sh@@ less space serves as a Lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you have not been assigned to their fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to throw around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders were to be voted in front of occupation . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , committed to the independence against the Dutch rule , turned out quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which holds control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal adher@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Cor@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport system .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo stems , and from cor@@ ru@@ ff@@ ing roofs that were converted by rust in various gel@@ b@@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , hon@@ ed Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade Tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ze province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ze Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gol@@ d@@ mine of the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ country provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has sold a value of 3,@@ 1 billion US dollars gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a wealth of resources valued at valued 78 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua that ensure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans is still preserved a sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port has paid local military military and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy re@@ threaten these Golden G@@ ans and are treated by mer@@ c@@ ading .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal state in the 1970 @-@ 1990s were under the subject of the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission on genocide .
&quot; in the region , the Indones@@ ian police took more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the region . &quot;
&quot; we value all lose &quot; means in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are , such as im@@ mort@@ g@@ ations and torture , are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , as each week can happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia @-@ researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws are reinforced as Pap@@ u@@ as resources have a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of In@@ don@@ esi@@ ology .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is to 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim econom@@ ists are transformed by the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people are struggling to stay here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai mix@@ ers , who moved to the provincial capital Cor@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the m@@ ama mom &#91; the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - her market cost .
&quot; Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , formerly known as Jok@@ ov@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 the inequalities and judicial violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the former Zimmer@@ mann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai , on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle by the darkness . &quot;
the ro@@ cking children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off their tone , and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , said , and smote the group with their gun , told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard to beaten that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government Commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ate the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police force and the Military Commander centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried out cerem@@ onial Jag@@ ni@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita Dance - in circles continuously and a bird @-@ singing im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some prot@@ esters began to tow stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses do more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it is not released in an official document of TI@@ ME that has not been released from the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ wning danger and called for rest and called the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening in the mood to listen .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the people gathered together . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired &quot; , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the ar@@ chery was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries only one name , the TI@@ ME in dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the Che@@ ese inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ tern , that his officers must only secure their station &quot; &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filmed &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks with Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , he held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and to tackle the historical abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately resolved , so it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Lu@@ anto , in October 2016 , said that he establishes a court mechanism for resolving historical human rights ab@@ uses in October 2016 . &quot;
but the phrases began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must go through . &quot;
&quot; then he made a retreat , when he talked with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he was indicted for crimes against humanity for crimes against humanity , said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or bloody independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took against such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ tious un@@ believer .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have fear , being arrested by the military , have been frightened to be frightened . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
&quot; he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , looking for the army to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring an unconscious man into hospital , died a person and 17 others have been injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when he fis@@ her in a nearby river died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
trac@@ ted villagers prot@@ ested before the location office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw stones upon officers , who re@@ acted upon it by losing war@@ ts . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the amount and killed a killer .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives close to the hospital and witness as the last one has been delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officials to account and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police in the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a unrest for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i , and Dam@@ al who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ ed to the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the Reb@@ mann army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by meeting the adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai during the last few years , under the pretext of the &quot; backup of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some are never diving again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as far away .
people here build everything they eat : especially emergency and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each of which can edit four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a tasted only 10,000 in@@ dones@@ ian ro@@ up@@ ies ( 75 C@@ ents ) .
economic inequalities between the indigenous Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport in larger numbers .
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better trained and prosperous migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the Chief Executive Board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions of the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p became de@@ ported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to the movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the correspon@@ den@@ ces of Jok@@ ov@@ is electoral campaign , the limitations of the reporting should take up to promote transparency and development , not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ on un@@ quiet east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial , and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
the lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ onen @-@ Inseln - the UN Human Rights Council on , the &quot; various and widely spread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian outside of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r referred to the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights accidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 visited , en@@ camp@@ ed their silence and highlighted him &quot; We want Freedom , &quot; according to a source , which also took part in the session but will remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are likely not able to vote again for Jok@@ ov@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai nuts , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the Board of directors . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people knows that it is under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , in impover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , see her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i , as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sw@@ ave a last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite , the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in one area opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never come to justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a t@@ ect@@ onic head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscrapers from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers of the world in Dubai its pass@@ book and forced hundreds of residents to escape from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that runs in just two years by the high @-@ house , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we are at fire @-@ alert and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot;
&quot; we burned down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; told a resident told his name as George ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours , GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cool . &quot;
&quot; the government said , they work on the provision of accommodations for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can further revi@@ ve questions about safety of materials , which are used in outer areas of skyscrapers around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the dis@@ guise , the outdoor clothing for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates for insulation and dis@@ guise on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a indu@@ ce in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International tennis association ( IT@@ F ) has fallen through his large Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the A@@ GM .
&quot; at the Ho @-@ Chi @-@ Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport @-@ revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single has not only been supported on two pay@@ cards , Hau@@ ch@@ thin is not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the fact often very long , but even so very este@@ emed Five @-@ sentence classics remain in the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F @-@ president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore , was only missing . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations do not have accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historic competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not only at the vote was finished , after many contradictions already the proposal came to fill the Fin@@ als in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details , so the fin@@ alists are in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the future in the first round of the host . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce costs for the organis@@ ers , the requirements are facilitated and the players will have to complete official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travelers cont@@ ented items in the airplane , find out a pol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; a survey among passengers came out that over 20 percent are conscious of the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent , who entered the aircraft , while they bore accidentally , rot@@ amed kni@@ ves or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed , they would have discovered that they have been abandoned with bul@@ lets , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey was conducted at more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was also stated that younger travellers should be ab@@ used rather the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents said that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was prohibited from the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items that were inten@@ tionally b@@ anded by T@@ SA agents , were food and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 per cent gave kno@@ w@@ ingly items with blades carried by the security control , while 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents affir@@ med that they were inten@@ tionally introduced to the airplane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have questioned travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gles were brought to the airport security and how many it was inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that the people , the most likely smu@@ g@@ ware - wis@@ s@@ ingly or ignorant - by the safety of those who were most often flying . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
people often are uns@@ afe which liquids they are allowed to take them or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest amount of the T@@ SA conf@@ is@@ cated items have been conf@@ is@@ cated liquids . &quot;
&quot; for a time , the people , T@@ SA could view books as a smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids is allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la &apos;s customers cancel order
&quot; electric @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k is available with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has signed up until now that a part of the customer has re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant numbers to sales momentum and still gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed for the first time a different , less gl@@ oss number : the cancellations made during the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k often asked with the more than 500,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car over the past few months , the delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k Mus@@ k : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders were 6@@ 3.000 re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is merely a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; if a cancellation pays Tes@@ la the 1000 Euro ( in the US 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation deposit . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations before , sp@@ elled Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that the cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la leader does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge among the ambitious growth goals is not at demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la has delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 it should be together - all models assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is evident .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , Mus@@ k currently come per day 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who orders today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; must be expected in the second half of 2018 with delivery - when Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand new , never in practice tested production lines with no greater inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , there is too much delays , then the transi@@ tions of reservations to the problem could be Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent in@@ cont@@ ented customers to run away from af@@ ar . &quot;
EPA Chief P@@ ru@@ des withdraw its way back to reducing emissions because of the rejection of the rules of the Obama Era
&quot; once he had been compl@@ ained by 15 States , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took its previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions smo@@ g and to reduce emissions . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ des presented the changes , as its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities towards responsive faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been collected against his previous place in a federal state of living .
&quot; it is a deadline , held on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for bot@@ tom@@ es zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced June that he will delay the compliance with a year , in order to spend more time in order to study the plan and avoid it , to interfere in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by president Donald Tr@@ ump At@@ tor@@ ney General of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma was a long time to severe harm to environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt , P@@ ru@@ itt is repeated to block the rules or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the latest legal back @-@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al Roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Bureau of Labour has decided that the EPA has passed its authority as he tried to re@@ charge the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas companies for monitoring and reducing methane . &quot;
&quot; in an on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ des proposed that his about @-@ face with o@@ zone standards was simply the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the countries through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often asked the deadlines for implementing and then to be maintained , accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and agreed to deal with an agreement for the implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who promised the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority to us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA has said that P@@ ru@@ des will eventually use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority , to ensure that the regulations &quot; on a solid policy and the best available information is based . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans in the Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive re @-@ version of the o@@ zone regul@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved in the last month by 2015 should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years . &quot;
the measure has not yet been set up in the Senate .
&quot; the New York Adv@@ oc@@ ate At@@ tor@@ ney Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man who led the coalition of the States who compl@@ ained the EPA in this week , said the group intended to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our pl@@ agues - is an important asset for health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers , who are directly affected by the smo@@ g , who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; new York joined in this case California , Connecticut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;
&quot; o@@ zone o@@ zone arises when contam@@ in@@ ants from cars , power plants , oil raff@@ es , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere on sunlight react . &quot;
&quot; the stit@@ ching smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature death cases . &quot;
representatives of the public health care and the environ@@ ment@@ alist che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ lo &apos;s change of course change .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it needs to get this sensible step by those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe in , &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d from the center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump @-@ government , to poll@@ uting them with environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery A@@ real in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 16.00 hours . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the locality is the historical St. Hil@@ arius facility a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth benefit seren@@ ade @-@ Seren@@ ade can ench@@ ant himself from this powerful place .
the rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ours of their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini empha@@ sizes : &quot; it is a unique fishing village . &quot;
&quot; in the year 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in the Artist of Wur@@ ttem@@ berg : Graf Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church of the parish of E@@ ber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the certificate , according to the Tum@@ linger Berg , was also a splendid farm that belonged to the church or the patron of Pat@@ ron , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ te Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , that is still to be recognized in the local image of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ mines these historical conditions .
the pat@@ ron@@ ate was born of the earliest medieval peculi@@ arity .
&quot; a Lord who built a church built , and occupied with a priest , continues to be owned by this church , and could also inher@@ it this Church . &quot;
inter@@ connected with it was the right to use a priest or propose a new parish priest .
three alt@@ ars were there in the church and two bells in the tower .
the greatest of the two crum@@ st on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was then for the first time 16@@ 92 , but had to be released in 1942 for the first time in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the shut@@ ters were stolen and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
17@@ 96 camp@@ ed French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and use them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church stopped in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead of hear@@ ers .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ al Church has been abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m let you stand .
in the New Year 18@@ 34 a storm turned the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half cras@@ hed .
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was cancelled . &quot;
only today &apos;s existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ ag remained as a witness of the 750 year old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em from the &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ ers &quot; &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn , the Hil@@ arius system . &quot;
&quot; the organis@@ er invite the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , at the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery for the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium and with express contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
town@@ ship Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking to the conclusion .
the program starts at 16.00 hours .
the admission is starting from 15.@@ 30 PM .
in addition to the seren@@ ade there is a qu@@ aint in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers make the fantastic view out . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only on dry weather .
the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius system that is of importance for tum@@ our and speakers .
the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ ours feel particularly committed to the home care as Seren@@ ade @-@ organizer Walter Mart@@ ini vali@@ dated .
association wants to test approval of angles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ es &quot; &quot; does not see a legal condition for the construction and therefore has turned on to the land council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; has prompted land@@ owners Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ et no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen , only at the border to the Schwal@@ m@@ tal there is a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentrations of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
the zones are intended to prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city Vier@@ sen had decided not only a few days before through a change in the area &apos;s time period , a second wind power plant in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but who had not approved the District Government in Düsseldorf because of a form@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; by the lack of planned legal pre@@ condition the contracted per@@ missions is still un@@ lawful and therefore also withdraw , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : the City Council approved once again the wind Con@@ centr@@ ation zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District Government is still pending before the summer break .
&quot; likewise : &quot; &quot; with this point , the distribution of a permit for the establishment of wind turbines are legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of a challenge .
&quot; the corresponding writing have been received by circle Four@@ sen since last week , &quot; stated a spokes@@ person . &quot;
the circle takes it for the reason to re @-@ examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they are expected to do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday did not want to express themselves in terms of reasoning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W re , an affiliate of the NE@@ W , is planning the construction of four to 200 meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had been involved in which the city of Vier@@ sen was involved , p@@ ei@@ ghs agreements with the owner of about 65 hectares of great per@@ imeter . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - this represents around one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ se@@ wer households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re is planning to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; in the past summer , four @-@ legged City breaks green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor are working together : woman dies in the terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday afternoon against 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ n@@ ap and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman has been injured .
two other persons were slightly wounded .
the national road remained closed over hours .
according to police information a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch went with her car as part of the accompanying road with her 53 @-@ year mother as the accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealers plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping in the city centre in September . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ ditions and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September , to attract the local residents to the city center . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; weekend , the customers should raise awareness of what offers the own city away from the usual supermarket @-@ commodity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ nights &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bag , point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian king . &quot;
&quot; municipal authorities and craftsmen , cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
&quot; thus the ren@@ ditions and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; active @-@ day &quot; &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts , to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the reference to parking fees that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be created again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city center while shopping out of the view .
&quot; in the end , all of them must help to revi@@ ve the city center - to land@@ owners , the operations of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it landed , with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y to overcome , which had spread partly , had king in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , director of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , shared with the first third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time in five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ pf@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; the day should promote and promote the appreciation of local trade and establish its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says Stre@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; the action under spring guidance of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her sales , direct environment . &quot;
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , it came to a inns in the school building . &quot;
new further people have been violated .
&quot; during a gas blast in the U.S. city Minneapolis , two people have been killed and nine have been injured , some of them hard . &quot;

a man died as part of a school building at the blast .
one first mixed later was also dead @-@ born .
among the dead it was a man@@ ners of the school .
&quot; as a bl@@ iss@@ ful cause , the authorities expected working on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people in the buildings of the Minne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump went down after a secured trans@@ cri@@ bed by telephone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the boundary wall
trans@@ cription by phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to listen to , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President compl@@ ained him , because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall to publicly . &quot; &quot; said he said to him , &quot; &quot; This can not tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started its presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and sw@@ am , Mexico for the project to pay . &quot;
Tran@@ cri@@ p@@ te of his first attack with the Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m g@@ ymnasium were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees migr@@ ated to take over , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was put on by the Government Obama to make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
mo@@ ores Ford massacre : activ@@ ist rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury was carried out by a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ umped on the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with tissues to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
inside sh@@ aded the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; bro@@ te the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ened the silence , when a young black man was torn away from the passenger . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a re@@ position . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all of them are very real si@@ gh . &quot;
since 2005 citizens come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ col@@ lage as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
nobody was charged ever because of the murder .
&quot; it really is in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of re@@ mission . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former congress of the state Georgia and a life @-@ speaking citizen .
it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call to action and constitutes an annual reminder of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want to prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a judicial medical practitioner lays a beg@@ gar on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding seas were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none have ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens say that double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia to give their voice for the first time , in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the election st@@ ach according to details of the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ ming Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a struggle - allegedly on account of a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she bore , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they moved away from prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b around the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison , who has prepared the mor@@ de and arranged according to a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , evidence of eradic@@ ated and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks still formulated it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a franchise massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual demand of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; her representation is vivid , expres@@ sive and explained in a kind of deep racism that many believe that in America he no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and still more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ x , because we are then confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in us all , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I have done . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - into a room and lau@@ ghing as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of Chief clan for years , but he said , the role will never become easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty , because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to preserve this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return at these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the t@@ ester out@@ cry and than@@ ked it , fur@@ ious , that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- , dev@@ oting of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona preser@@ ves the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cked . &quot;
I don &apos;t believe that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; but , chir@@ ping one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the harsh &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and the energy in the room shifts the energy in the room , a feeling of comra@@ des@@ hip replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this correctly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with im@@ prints . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is cry , shots , and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Billi@@ e Holidays Abroad &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost uni@@ form@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is made from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come just down the road . &quot;
&quot; they have all experienced nearly eight hours of Georgia , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels t@@ aut . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering to each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , when he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ene and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe her tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh to the man in the suit that the cl@@ ans has played .
Nick Ras@@ cona embr@@ aces two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms together ; the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience continue with the actors for dinner .
&quot; at a table ch@@ opped a white pair from Atlanta excited about the re@@ position with a black pair , that they just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought to find words , which left the performance of the performance . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who like yourself and who do what they look like &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me lets me believe that the Lyn@@ chen still continues &quot; , &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; today , it is called the police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table , he eats and recalls the civil rights . &quot;
he said he had already begun to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the re@@ position is in a sense of inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf continues to be a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the stage stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) indicates a s@@ hab@@ by street corner with a wall and dam in Berlin , a &quot; pl@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR @-@ times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the R@@ hen@@ ger@@ ent is pos@@ ing as a rock , or alternatively an I@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ ffed oil sp@@ ans remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhin@@ k@@ ills - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ay ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ess , they lead Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , zer@@ ren in Hollywood manager a cor@@ pse in the trunk of the trunk and give the Kra@@ w@@ allo Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the great fi@@ ber@@ ed Ha@@ gen which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal the scene when he turns out to Sieg@@ fried .
later there must also be Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a powerful applause .
&quot; fe@@ ather@@ ed are celebrated Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ Con@@ ent Jan@@ owski , which ben@@ ds more humble and the hands on Merkel smoking . &quot;
big applause are available for the celebration of celebrations that shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in le@@ vel@@ ing amuse@@ ment clothing .
the performance was expected by Frank Cast@@ orf and his office team .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a f@@ le concert concert in 2013 , there were five years later great rejo@@ icing in which the &quot; &quot; be@@ h &quot; &quot; ruin . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to be happy about it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; ring &quot; in some way , &quot; she had told just before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive Res@@ um@@ é .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year just at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt , in the pur@@ se of furniture , once a week I was helping to get to Gre@@ ys in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked on school already in an open day @-@ day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a beautiful , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I have taken Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say successful . &quot;
&quot; I realized for me , that it is a gui@@ deline for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what you do .
&quot; do a social year , since there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point perhaps also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
I will study dual studies probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social labor training and study students in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule .
is it not uncommon during the Volun@@ te@@ er Service to have several different areas of use ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it is probably always looking forward to where to do his FS@@ J .
&quot; it is possible to work from Alter@@ sheim to youth work , in all sorts of fac@@ ets of social work . &quot;
with me it was very varied .

con@@ voy attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in self @-@ order attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ bed has attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a soldier of Nato , and several others hurt . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter have been violated a declaration of Nato .
&quot; un@@ confirmed local reports , according to the incident in the district , Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also died three civilians . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that made Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday were killed by more than 30 people in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ bed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato , it is said that an explosion on Thursday night was to happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by one &quot; by persons to impro@@ mp@@ ed explo@@ sives &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the statement states that all the last in a stable state are in a stable state and be treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations in Afghanistan , in the first half of 2017 there was at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , including 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , there was a suicide @-@ car@@ om@@ b at least 30 people in a mainly chic district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a tremendous bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; the force under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of U.S. forces to support the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents said that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policy and especially in the call of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA turns decision to del@@ aying the smo@@ g rule after law@@ suits
&quot; the US @-@ American Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay a regulation of Obama &apos;s government , after which the states are obliged to dem@@ ise the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 countries approved the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA was announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive the so @-@ called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ ance 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and remembering that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ des had announced the EPA in June to be measured with o@@ zone @-@ regulations in which parts of the country must be measured to establish more stringent air quality standards - to delay a year up to October 2018 .
&quot; a group of 15 most largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed the Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental demands , which the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which should boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump the economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the withdrawal of Democrats and nature of nature who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and reinforce the breathing symptoms . &quot; &quot; for example , asthma . &quot;
council wishes Community space
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two contradictions , the com@@ man@@ der@@ at of flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ ings decides the establishment of a communal space in the future senior residence . &quot;
&quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing part was signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it is still going to last until the church has so far been belonging to the church community , but there is now no plans for planning a private investor to st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still on the boat , is offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with about 70 square meters area available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council float above , such a common room not just as meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ cer living but open into the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word of &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision is decided by providing funding for the ongoing budget already last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is located in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a common area would be , so reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to sign@@ alize in order to sign@@ alize the investor in this regard , that there is no bil@@ lets between the legs , the statement that both Satt@@ el@@ - and what is reduced to ambient temperature and the construction of economic power - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , so does not just Wil@@ fred sole , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously passed the panel .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s Call refers to the many own buildings , with which one can &apos;t get really progres@@ sing , that you can now rest at the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I make myself difficult . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ i absolutely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind it a covered sub@@ Convention to any already high @-@ level or even foreign investors .
&quot; that is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real , in the two @-@ fel@@ ine market@@ able object , is the contrary . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ve request , compl@@ ained for the proposed proposal , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; in the case of two contra@@ votes at the original program , Stefan H@@ all is so summ@@ arized : &quot; &quot; if we summ@@ arize the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is hur@@ led to street
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath by a car and was badly injured . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; this was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; soccer also is tactic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the res@@ in from star to Stern
in the Har@@ z the nationwide &quot; star@@ ring path &quot; was created .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary trail is there in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a star@@ ring path &quot; am contrary to the information needs of many Har@@ z@@ hi@@ go@@ ers , called it . &quot;
&quot; he connect nature , science , movement and sports performance . &quot;
members want to set up along the planned route and find out about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well accessible installations at five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; demand for St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be added to the internet .
&quot; therefore , the site selection has a good mobile network reception . &quot;
also accessibility is an criterion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train is to be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ ring path the observer experience a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is far away . &quot;
conve@@ ys also in which constellation can be a selected star and when he is best to see .
&quot; the association has already been operating in the mountain district St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is located at the highest located observatory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; the location in the middle of the Har@@ z National Park , according to the Federal Ministry of Natural Protection , is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
frequently they are from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda galaxy with naked eye clearly visible .
in the university city since 2003 there has been an initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen something similar to the planned star@@ ters - the planetary trail .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary trail leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the els with the individual planets - including from the d@@ warf @-@ planned Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are exactly the distance and scale up of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ ink so on a bul@@ let of 6.@@ 5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distance of the sun at least 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians need a good lesson to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian is therefore faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ star but would still take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia that should be placed in a collision event in the near future under 147 pounds and met for the first time on Thursday .
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ finished World Bo@@ xing Council body champion , the hall went down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through an agre@@ eable decision on the former four @-@ divisions champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time are both fighters members of the Top @-@ Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you think , champion ? &quot;
I wish you a lot of luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends its belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 am on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair of photos pos@@ ing , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is climate , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I went up for bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to shut down on body weight .
and he has to move to Lei@@ cht@@ wei@@ ler &#91; 135 &#93; &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans are demanding .
let &apos;s give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko was voted .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko will fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year in order to arrange the next summer with Gar@@ cia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their body @-@ weight change in the Forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and pressed themselves later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can produce this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he says Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may possibly participate in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side view &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... You always wanted to be co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both said , they could feel the momentum going on for their own struggle . &quot;
that is the battle that needs to be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that is Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four wounded after tire @-@ bur@@ zer
&quot; in an accident on the A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost almost 16,@@ 30 hrs shortly before the connecting market , probably after a tire bur@@ zer the control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger turns to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ threw himself and then on the roof of the green ro@@ am . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the last by the rescue service , the A7 was locked in direction north for about one hour , then the traffic could be passing on the left @-@ road at the accident place . &quot;
&quot; Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; triangle &quot; &quot; works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 at the end of the season against Braunschwei@@ g , that the optimization of the def@@ enses in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschwei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must fit even better in Au@@ e &quot; , &quot; says the defensive player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triangles should also be further optimized .
and a gate after a mis@@ ch@@ ap does not want to include the Fort@@ ress even more .
&quot; for the future , it will be so no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better right after the experience in preparation with the triple , than with the four quad@@ ran@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; I do not know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ hero@@ ic Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the triple positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann player who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; a requirement is , however , that we do even better harmon@@ ize and we don &apos;t afford to do so many errors . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after an accident by a mis@@ er@@ un@@ ending start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
he wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; the start of the season evalu@@ ates only after six to eight game days , &quot; said Fried@@ hero@@ ic Funk@@ el who would not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken prematurely due to an accident . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might be even a bit of fres@@ her , as they had not been heavy and complete game such as Fort@@ una against a flour@@ ishing favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; although the guests come from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday into the meeting , finally ( almost ) finished stadi@@ on of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take away them away , just because we have the right to come under the first Se@@ chs , Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ nonsense , &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is very positive when only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one has to propose from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement , would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
and so he wants to experience its players on Sunday for no means .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden were subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the people tested older than 18 years are . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzles medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has started performing the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum process , you should do more precisely during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in the assessment of the correct age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; up to date , migration has been sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older while in further 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person may &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are conducted only in cases where the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson by the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results for the past months are constantly being established . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine &quot; Local . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has taken over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigations will be 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det made the 5@@ 81 results published , it stated that in the 243 of these cases the person had said openly that they will be 18 years old in the year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical pension assessment , in case of x @-@ rays of we@@ en@@ umer@@ ations and MR@@ I &apos;s recordings are analyzed , which then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska institute whose work encompasses the assessment of the biological maturity of men to see if they were sooner or later than usual by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as adults is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in if the person is just below 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday a seven ton was heavily installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , builders at the department of street and traffic in the department of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began at all three san@@ itation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
Bau@@ ende is scheduled for October and is sure that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge of concrete , which is cloth@@ ed with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the stability and road safety , the three components are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now received a 1.@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called fr@@ appe .
&quot; this is an edge @-@ forti@@ fication , which is also used as working path . &quot;
on the southern part of the bridge a 2.@@ 20 meter width is scheduled for Friday .
then the Foot@@ steps should be gone .
&quot; the special thing is that it deals with finished parts , a patent of the ram@@ ental company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the pat@@ ched fr@@ ing@@ es .
special finger@@ tips has required the set of power lines by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; because there is also a glass of glass , where many companies are connected . &quot;
the inhabitants were informed about the plans in advance of the work on the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cancer had to be de@@ ple@@ ted . &quot;
for the bridges between the building building and the ren@@ aming in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic @-@ lane is regulated by a traffic light .
for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach local entrance the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; t@@ ann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three shar@@ ehol@@ dings is equivalent to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest at German potato salad
&quot; yes , it is not that frequent to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , what else is difficult to bring to a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the Kre@@ ist@@ ag of the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad coalition that shows on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell on the loud poster &quot; &quot; great electoral campaign &quot; &quot; invites . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names on the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading team of the German elections on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are before the event already hours before the event , do not want to listen to Af@@ D @-@ eag@@ les but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; at the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the great organizers , was really pleased : &quot; great , how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D easily , &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police have many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence mainly on the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how has the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vol@@ ei@@ fel reported that he tried to make such an event and won the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had asked for Dau@@ n in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built @-@ in Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes , not enough parking spaces are available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view to the event at the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : at 20 o &apos;clock the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz provides a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 list@@ ener , waiting for the top can@@ did@@ acy for the Bundestag selection , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D @-@ event , the guests in the court have a longer breath , but also there is shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can withdraw - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one hits the trumpet
&quot; listening to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he hits a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; , &quot; or even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ ers &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
both Sol@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have won sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European prime orches@@ tras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is played at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ ters to the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both are united the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ ator N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , classic jazz , jazz and free games to an intrigu@@ ing overall work of art . &quot;
this cent@@ rep@@ ie@@ ce of the program was first performed in Freiburg during this spring time .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it independently for the two musicians and more still : the Has@@ l@@ acher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs will be consciously included in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual alism
&quot; some people love gri@@ lled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; says Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart completely openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual alism . &quot;
&quot; when I stri@@ cken in gri@@ lled meats , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
the probably most well @-@ known relationship of the Hol@@ ly@@ .@@ stars was the one to their &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson who eventually went bitter .
&quot; despite all this ass@@ ures the br@@ acing performer opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar , &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve got . &quot;
&quot; or do you think about , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave that she bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; I just never liked to be taken seriously , not serious . &quot;
&quot; especially among them , she suffered loud &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school days , when she loved like a be@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been really very injured .
&quot; when I was eleven , the kids told me , I would look like a book . &quot;
I really felt attacked , frightened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think , &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public did not enjoy their love life : &quot; people expect you in a certain way , and this anno@@ yed me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some may call me un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he will change the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening with President Tr@@ ump , that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have taken away from me , &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and thinking ... today , I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump was previously promised a HU@@ GE announcement at the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice accepted not the democratic candidate for Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes . &quot;
For@@ bes proved that he has carbon mines in five states and inherited a carbon dioxide from his father .
it is worth approximately 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday evening announced a statement in which it said : &quot; the party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party , which would rather prevent us than working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ments and the control of the least legal entities in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without guidance and is unable to find a positive , ein@@ i@@ ent message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ chair Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an open ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be recorded in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics Chef Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ ak@@ in said during the New AF Congress in the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championship , that the exile of his country from sport was correct and that he is determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; all athletes , who were cut off at gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the prohi@@ bitions which was founded in November 2015 , after a report of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) notices on state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has experienced in itself that she has experienced some pretty hot times , and everything is done to make sure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; he said , he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been achieved but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia again , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ ety @-@ Russian athletes compete in the athle@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; testing tests were still inadequate and mis@@ understood coach are still free , he said Re@@ por@@ tern in London following a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries for in Mali cras@@ hed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral party in the North h@@ ess@@ ical Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two at a helicopter turn in Mali had thought out soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral at high security measures .
&quot; in addition to an un@@ resolved crash , Secretary of Defense said to Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) . &quot;
&quot; they described the two outlines , but as &quot; pat@@ rons of their expert . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we owe us to this highest sacrifice , which they produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old St@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen were alive on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge was transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a Skul@@ l of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at the mid@@ day only the relatives were added to the church farewell .
&quot; after that , the funeral party started in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics . &quot;
underneath were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; in the grape , ro@@ ses were down , the relatives were arm in arms to the bag . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary of Defense by Le@@ yen entered the &quot; &quot; comm@@ enting soldiers &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; sat@@ anic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann was able to build the flight operation of the batt@@ les@@ bian tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with one of the first six educated tiger drivers of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , Com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of reg@@ im@@ ents , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; &quot; if these crew could not aver@@ t the crash , it would not have liked . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali did not appear to be dangerous in the Le@@ yen : the bet was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; for a country , from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the s@@ är@@ ge were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they are sh@@ ado@@ wed , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no tomb next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried after his death in addition to his wife . &quot;
sharing the Royal House on Thursday with .
the Danish Kings will be buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard already made a Sark@@ op@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , says it further in the communication . &quot;
where prince Hen@@ rik is buried ; it is still unclear .
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik had never made a feeling that he was not happy with his title .
after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would like to become king .
in 2016 he went to reti@@ ring and also put the title &quot; prin@@ c@@ hl . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not have the title and the function he wanted , he sees himself in front of his wife - even not after death , declared L@@ ene ballet by the leader of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ year will be ultimately unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be set in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; the native @-@ Henri de laboratory de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French noble sex , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand in his nearly 50 years of reign over the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik vo@@ iced on the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did , critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was sw@@ aying , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ lu@@ ges instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation in this country , I could not hope for the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
these were equal to two errors ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift new elections
CD@@ U and F@@ DP from the potential majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a swift re@@ election of the land of land , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dissolution of the Parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Greens from their land of land in Lower Saxony , had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the landing elections , the red @-@ green coalition lost in Hannover thus lost its scarce One @-@ vote majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green Party MP El@@ ke T@@ west founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to accommodate them .
&quot; thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP have had 69 seats in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on land day , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; so far , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land of Land@@ tag is going to be regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state of government should now decide whether to govern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l however , it is essential that the day @-@ day decides as quickly as its self @-@ resolution as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday through its action .
&quot; the state @-@ reporting also provides the possibility that the country &apos;s country draws the trust to Prime Minister , and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be tested legally clean , &quot; said Th@@ um@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
one will discuss all the questions if they are legally properly tested .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens Step &quot; but somewhat cur@@ vy .
the Policy herself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she describes himself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Greens demanded the dis@@ d@@ ots members to return their country council .
&quot; we of course go out of course that she has preserved its country day , which she has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , the state leader Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; we de@@ pl@@ ore the decision of El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ . &quot;
they have deliberately decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; also against the background , that there were no sub@@ stan@@ tive differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ head of the Anglo @-@ American MEP El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) , to choose the country &apos;s day fast again . &quot;
the res@@ ignation of west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the policy statement &quot; &quot; in its last van@@ ity and in its fr@@ ust their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General of Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U is engaged in Lower Saxony this dirty game and tries to beat its political capital .
Nieder@@ sachsen CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its members to include El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw T@@ jack@@ ets , with personality careers , gave the result of the Irish election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the most powerful force at that time before the SPD &apos;s SPD , SPD and Green had a strong majority of one voice in the country day . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister during the interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ itter , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is discussed in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr. Schmidt - How can consumers protect against poison@@ ous eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumer consumer and consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and review the stamp printing .
&quot; at the consumer protection portal www.@@ food war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states have the most recent information on the eggs char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the insurrection from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately been dis@@ connected , and since the announcement of Germany , the du@@ b@@ ness of Germany is in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
&quot; trade has just as well as the producers to carry out , that the sold products are in@@ capable and hygien@@ ically harmless . &quot;
&quot; if exceeded with eggs the back@@ low content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are non @-@ traffic . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time are not the operations to blame .
sit factories and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; after a high level of knowledge , the production facilities does not meet any immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must be reck@@ on because of mut@@ ally illegal practices of services companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controversi@@ es in the harvest .
is there only missing from the staff or by conclu@@ sive competence ?
&quot; it was just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; in reality , however , that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled out at 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent explanation of such events and the hand@@ over to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the instances in which criminal off@@ ences may be of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times a lot , that I would expect a seamless explanation by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm clock for food and@@ als really necessary ?
consumer women and consumers have the right to get secure and secure food exclusively .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de in the food sector is used , consumer purchases and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ elled means , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the post@@ ure of food delivery is not acceptable and must be cancelled immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it must be consistent with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I expect all the competent authorities that the atomic fact is rapidly and incomplete . &quot;
how the financial rules of football have on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent un@@ resolved issues of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world @-@ record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban cre@@ ws from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules which were launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A UEF@@ A , meaning that PS@@ G has to point out at some point that the transfer of ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to buy the Brasi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will be several 10 million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make the money loose with certainty , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy wealthy ruler of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations are allowed to purchase a lot of money for the purchase of players , but they must be able to use the Bre@@ ak @-@ Even point in their on the soccer @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Pl@@ ini after his election at the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that they had enormous debt in their pursuit of success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ed to ruin , if banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved to the debt to the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the amendment meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential , and then invested heavily in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ annual event @-@ period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen in in@@ gn@@ ade 2015 by the presidency in in@@ gn@@ ade , the UEF@@ A successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; certainly , FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to intensify the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a flat bowl , it may distribute the amount for billing over the duration of his treaty . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the solution for the next five years in the amount of € 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million in the annual financial statements can be rejected . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a pro@@ clamation of 60 million euros ( back then 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players remains limited . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs who could try to out@@ cover their financial supervision by collecting their revenue by companies , who are connected to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could give the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not apply as a legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A opted for the value of the P@@ SA &apos;s sponsorship by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it has been reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar , about payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; however , PS@@ G and Qatar have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will be easy to find and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A Reg@@ ul@@ ators would be easy to find . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will still be more attentive , to observe any attempt to deal with the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they said under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
&quot; the recent published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.2 million euros . &quot;
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrival is a blessing for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ kot@@ ar . &quot;
the association will assume that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signature .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would inj@@ ure the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the State , &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of cat@@ alogues , &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state which financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the finan@@ ci@@ elle Fair@@ play , because you have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;

&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympi@@ as of 2016 , was failed in the national championship secre@@ tion and could only look at the flo@@ ppy competition only from the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
&quot; also with the first try qualified , the Polish title , Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who threw 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres far , for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia is working in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ he years , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ years @-@ Gr@@ unge &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV three years , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels as if the time was short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd proportions ( it contained a original story for a promising D@@ ose vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; playing at the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ aged games play dirty children , who will grow up - they nevertheless made the im@@ possibility to return to the final part of the weather . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults , who are now playing adults is less emotional , and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand of Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , who looked at the cradle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at a point , a character is characterized by an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) still does not forget . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is still another crazy @-@ mal@@ ignant p@@ lot , included in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the courses are the best part of the franchise . &quot;
&quot; it makes especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ os sub@@ go@@ ate@@ e of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments random madness that could make this franchise may be like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I will show as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : &quot; how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon has now been reminis@@ cent of a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ eling @-@ I@@ kon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the Comintern created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a found TV series : a Romanian Drama Festival with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main products - a hard str@@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ al@@ ist J@@ ó@@ z@@ - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt to be syn@@ ced into English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some nice G@@ ags for watching ( the police spend time on watching chess on television , as Americans may do it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is so very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ iring propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often like a single one . &quot;
&quot; for six long episodes , it is moving , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; which was reduced to a lower length could supply his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re better , as Gregor and Io@@ z@@ sef always come back the American Embassy , whose lobby always occupied by two thick men who has a he@@ ap of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the Medium @-@ communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for food for a li@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creator was not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police are a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart were sold numerous objects , such as the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office on Friday . &quot;
15 accus@@ ations were arrested in the age between 25 and 77 years old and arrest warran@@ t against them .
&quot; in addition , the officials had greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , bul@@ lets , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
on the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are likely to be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , over 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia becomes organised drug criminal , heavy violence , trying murder and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer of 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office was determined against organised drug trafficking in the Southern German region . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , an patho@@ gen exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large extent on the Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo . &quot;
&quot; in the spotlight of the investigations , especially Italian nationality with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; even an incident on May 27 , in hip , where several shots were fired at the early morning , is likely to go to the bank account of the gang . &quot;
how to complain large gaps in the foreig@@ ner &apos;s register
&quot; data of citizens who should not arise , &quot; : one report said the foreig@@ ner @-@ register in Germany shows severe shortcomings . &quot;
the lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ ous mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
&quot; the officer for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has made aware of a media report pointed out to large gaps in the country @-@ country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the resulting data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ vi@@ ed mis@@ decisions , &quot; warned in an analysis that is the &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , ten million people are covered with foreign citizenship , including 5,@@ 7 million of non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by some 600 exclusion authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer arise in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can greatly slow back , it means the report continues . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the statistics of travelling individuals are covered by EU citizens who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; but led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners , then it means analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government obviously started to send refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children to Italy if they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; the coming forth from an internal paper by the Bundes@@ am@@ ts for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ ro@@ cker Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this paper it means that the BAM@@ F lead such procedures to families with children , except for infants and small children , from Italy since June 1st , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , as the newspaper on the difficult situation was on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , the EU @-@ State is responsible for refugees from the EU . &quot;
&quot; if a migration is travelling to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country . &quot;
&quot; for reasons , the Office write now : &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( E@@ GM@@ R ) will consider these commitments for adequate .
other EU countries would also return to refugees within the Dublin Convention .
&quot; the internal political speaker at the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system un@@ lawful shooting conditions and a hazard to the child of child . &quot;
second @-@ best results achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood from in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons has already provided blood circulation for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 100 lit@@ res of blood with its meanwhile 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community at the meeting of the Municipal Council will multip@@ ly the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous , as our body is laid out for this and we ap@@ plau@@ d the Spen@@ cer Res@@ p@@ ect for foreigners who provide their blood for strangers , even more un@@ selfish , &quot; under@@ scored mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood@@ stream helps multiple people , &quot; explained the recycling of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the con@@ j@@ ven are de@@ composed of its constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; so , three people could benefit from a blood@@ stream . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the actions that were carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DRC . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change into the theatre house few years ago has led to higher participants . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ le , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer was awarded to the multi @-@ professional sa@@ unter , and were awarded for 50 participants . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra tu@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times each 500 milli@@ liters of her lifetime . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates of 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and weak@@ ening of inflation dimin@@ ished the spec@@ ulations over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; when they held the interest rates on family income in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the policy decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 for the interest rates to 0,@@ 25 % , with fewer members a rise in this month as weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income was expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but they signal that in the next few years , Z@@ adverti@@ ses would be necessary to grow by the Bre@@ xit heated inflation , and she said that the credit costs may need more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut Business package that was published one year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will demand time for finance plan to provide cheaper funding for banks , even though it is expected that it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate the Bank said : &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross Dom@@ estic Product ( GDP ) remains weak , since pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged to consumption . &quot;
&quot; to the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are raising the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases &quot; gradually &quot; and &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the forec@@ ast@@ ed growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared with the 1,@@ 9 % and 1.7 % compared with the launch in May . &quot;
she has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 percent in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news over the dollar and the euro .
the pound was by 0,5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 Euro .
&quot; the decision to no change arrives , after the recent dis@@ appoint growth rates down the increasing expectations on a raise raise and GDP rise in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.@@ 3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be expected in the third quarter , although it is easily rec@@ u@@ perate after the Bank towards the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ fl@@ ation@@ ary report provided little enthusiasm for households , which are affected by an increasing inflation and minor adjustments as the tigh@@ tening first is even worse before it will get better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy can not prevent the income in the next few years &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a portion of lower consumption expenses . &quot;
&quot; after lowering interest rates amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the counterpart . &quot;
&quot; the bank estimates that it will likely take four years , until this will reach the prices and the economy . &quot;
&quot; prior to the final verdict of the Bank to the interest rates , the call was increased after a raise , since inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ mounted households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July have demanded a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has declined last month from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will put it back in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the exceed@@ ance in relation to their aim of 2 % is &quot; entirely &quot; to the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ agne , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; given the recent return of s@@ wap locks , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be competitive again , as the len@@ ders would want to have been loud to shops and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those who run existing de@@ als and complete the new mort@@ gage , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is meant to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV drug than 10,000 people &quot;
patients will be received from September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in the N@@ HS access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment .
&quot; in England , N@@ HS England announces that an prior sexual intercourse prophy@@ la@@ xis prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) can reduce the risk risk of high @-@ risk cancer by approximately 86 percent , is now delivered by health service by a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed a verdict of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , after the pre@@ EP had to pay for the Pr@@ EP in spite of the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the announced &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief of Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention , &quot; during the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) . &quot;
&quot; sexual health hospitals in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to follow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 . &quot;
ex@@ iting prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV preparations to be taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that the EP significantly significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
taking the Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come to issue for treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; clinics are identified suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not well @-@ known by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy . &quot;
people who live in England and registered at a primary doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of drugs during this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of the Pr@@ EP by gathering clinical evidence on how it is used in large scale , and is implemented and implemented . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts for preventing HIV .
it is another milestone in which over three decades of continuing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , when it is targeted at vulnerable and dangerous people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people with high HIV risk free access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England , to develop a new instrument that is truly individu@@ alised and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this notice . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one has left the risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now since the Pr@@ EP @-@ test medicine was described , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , shadow @-@ Minister of Health Minister said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome and hesit@@ ant after monthly delays and hesit@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of the Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now , it is important that this study is done as soon as possible throughout the country to protect individuals who are infected HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of the proliferation of HIV in society . &quot;
the great life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment in a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large home in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed their bags and sold .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something , that was comparable to my price . &quot;
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square footage was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a sp@@ elled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne D@@ ining and a mezz@@ anine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose they commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and creating a home which was not only a development but also a place for life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms covered up , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think creative to release the publication .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so that they were over@@ thrown with , without we had to pick up . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement allowed it Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra @-@ drama .
&quot; for the mezz@@ anine , a classic cl@@ utch window of Ret@@ ro@@ vi@@ us looks down across the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors play a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
at both ends is a short corridor mir@@ r@@ ored to make him longer work .
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units can accommodate all the stocks and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went into , &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan of the reinforced , fur@@ ni@@ fied M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is when you push the door very easily , very easy to guide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property will be valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a vesti@@ gi@@ al form becomes a real estate agent , and a calculation is carried out based on bottom @-@ size . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to increase the ground floor and use high quality materials , which give the room its luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore can help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love you into the electric socket in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave them not . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars of real estate
&quot; two brothers are four decades , after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a confrontation with one of the largest real estate imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton Football Club &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court of Justice to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers acquired 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars , since then the family had bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - owned by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s fortune and Paul about one third . &quot;
it states that Col@@ in &apos;s ownership in the value of € 3@@ 16 million and Paul has valued at the value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the proposed resolutions proposed by Col@@ in proposed with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice took place on Friday the last Friday .
&quot; brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claimed to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; in argued , that is not true , it is not true , but he thro@@ ws Paul before , some possessions in competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it that was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the case , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firms . &quot;
Mrs De Lu@@ tis and her husband husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ 1990s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood @-@ property in which Col@@ in the first Je@@ wels of the family opened .
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was &quot; in the last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land that the brethren land before judgment , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis @-@ group , whereby col@@ in claims that Mark are paid 10 million dollars in leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; says Paul &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has kept very backward , although he was a former AF@@ L leader and after a biography in 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I really cannot say much &quot; , &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sorry that my brother Paul has chosen to acc@@ use me and to draw our family name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father did not have wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he is still hoping for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our business will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
umps of new Staff plans to restrict the media @-@ ab@@ stin@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Tr@@ ump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the head on a more even@@ ly circuit .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new head of the White House , attending his first working day with guiding staff , he placed a main problem at President Donald Tr@@ umps White House which he had repair : poor information that would enter the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ fing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring its media control . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship with television ranges from decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was upset because of an unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February opposite Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; &quot; the key to hold tr@@ umps Twitter is under control , according to six former election campaign , to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit ever &quot; &quot; was under control &quot; &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign officers must know what we do not know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets could not contain any more ig@@ ni@@ tion without their interventions .
&quot; we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , which is not sent to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; if his staff made it a few times to keep away from it , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , nobody has consistently prevent it from making tr@@ ump checks . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a white house , which consist of competing parties , repeatedly trying to further their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that could potentially build their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the president of strategic reasons , doubt@@ ful information . &quot;
this was an example that was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump how a volcano can react to negative press releases , especially such with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ aks and that he will find out where they come . &quot;
&quot; it happened at the end of February when anyone was accused of a signature of an article of Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy head office in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be from Lec@@ ks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; even though Johnson was ban@@ ished because of Shi@@ can@@ es , or that he has offered no concrete evidence , or that in the past he has vo@@ iced and vo@@ wed it in the past . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief Executive Board Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash . &quot;
how did it work ?
Kelly seeks three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ er still strive for influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make &apos;s mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ ling Cri@@ cher get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population is praying and hoped . &quot;
the police in all Europe will be ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested sword @-@ bre@@ aches are not known , clu@@ es out of the population and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; Christmas calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experience would have shown that many glimp@@ ses of holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
we have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ i has been viewed , more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online gest@@ ures could not be arrested so far , at least eleven of them based on information on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire line &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est domestic owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travellers on war@@ fu@@ ß , who have negotiated one from the municipality drawn dit@@ ch in order to re@@ claim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called the &quot; &quot; million@@ aire @-@ series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters , after they were ki@@ cked out only in May without being deter@@ red by one by the council to prevent sei@@ zur@@ es in order to prevent sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tactical group found a gap in the defense units , and thrust their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way . &quot;
&quot; desol@@ ation residents have aff@@ licted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it &apos; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They are pulled there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on the pedest@@ rains . &quot;
&quot; the Council must act in fact , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved and are now back .
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on the Stre@@ et@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my similarities , if the Council cannot stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a inhabitants who didn &apos;t want to be named , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridiculous ; we just saw the last round of this travel@@ er , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even have seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
an spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of a dirt camp on the land beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to move them as soon as possible .
&quot; to support our presentation , it is very important that as many locals call an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this contributes to creating an image of the situation where the court has to check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is going to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof will make the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house before the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ters is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof , through the then @-@ ambience operating company , the 13th of April 2014 was lost at about 30 000 nights per year and also income from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the County , the hotel building served as a collective accommodation which was advised for controversial discussion . &quot;
the city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; then , the decision was not disputed at that time in the council . &quot;
&quot; but above all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts colon@@ n@@ ite , Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and spoke at that time from serious prospective buyers to the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
&quot; the group Lu@@ isen@@ hotels with chair@@ person Bir@@ git Sh@@ er , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof in Berlin with a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus Categ@@ ory under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad men@@ al@@ b .
&quot; you are welcome Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been extracted , blankets to partially disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large equipped showers , the entrance area will be re@@ designed , there are new windows installed . &quot;
&quot; everything sol@@ ves later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; &quot; will be expressed as Thomas Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the facilities . &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown level , acc@@ entu@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is set to set up a broad , explaining Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel at home in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause he has already led to .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments asked , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; nearly under a million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor units are also brought on front of the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a patio there is a large terrace that is open from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : us @-@ Special sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair at US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel recorded the work over the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with appeal on with the thing trusted persons . &quot;
the paper marked the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expands its investigation and intensified .
the Sender CN@@ N reported it the first inv@@ itations of the Gre@@ mi@@ um related to a meeting between the el@@ dest son and Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin has been specifically mixed in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were talking between the m@@ umps of the campaign and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men are to be involved in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more Tr@@ umps in private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Off@@ ers Tr@@ ump personally moved into the center and the accus@@ ation will be re@@ pro@@ ached , whether the president hin@@ ders the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to examine and decide on present evidence in possible proportions , whether the indictment is to be charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also called the gas chambers .
mostly they will be switched on when it deals with bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
the panel can also be switched on by the Pro@@ secutor to re@@ charge individuals to take in .
&quot; according to the Sender CN@@ N already inv@@ itations were already issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were asked to be asked in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also Tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ ar election Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
&quot; right @-@ wing per@@ sever@@ ed on Thursday night in U.S. television , that the installation show that Mu@@ eller does not show shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the suspension of the old phase is at the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revelations , the President agreed on Thursday evening to present a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign to its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about which they can talk . &quot;
&quot; his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion , he wis@@ se nothing of the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but this work is also usually in secret , he said . &quot;
&quot; the White House advocate all measures , which accelerated the work of the agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot;
&quot; the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey said three times , that not against the President . &quot;
there is no need to accept that something changed in this way .
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this ro@@ ug@@ fs , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump came out loud , he had to h@@ amp@@ er the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump was asked for an attitude of the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the examination .
&quot; according to the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Special Off@@ ers and its employees . &quot;
the sol@@ vent spec@@ ulations about how to release Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special event of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , the president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller got a position in which he could theoretically be fired at D@@ ining of the President of the State Department . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step but to step forward .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators put on Thursday the bill , after which the special authority could no longer be released as simply . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ eberg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the western Antar@@ ctic , there is a gigantic ic@@ eberg of the almost seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for polar@@ isation and marine research on Wednesday .
&quot; the one tri@@ llion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss runs north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is a length of 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that researchers have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to man from him .
&quot; to what extent of climate change has played a role in the outbreak of the ic@@ eberg , according to research is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions in the region for approximately 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a billing background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken Kol@@ oss was so far a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ ap@@ is swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow further into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the head of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
&quot; at the north of this spring , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ tions was dis@@ rupted some years ago . &quot;
a complete Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is to be broken down , writes AW@@ I research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the more advanced channel has never been withdrawn as far as currently . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the ice @-@ plate can fall under tension and can fall under a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ eberg does not increase the sea level , as they can swim on the water and pus@@ hes ice so much water as it follows after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of s@@ ling@@ ering leads to the gl@@ aci@@ ers that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the ocean and much more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low extent , the British research project writes to the observation of the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is named after AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; on the passage from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although there is a natural act and is not aware of a direct connection to climate change , the king@@ sign is now into a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most widespread retreat since the beginning of record &quot; , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists be disputed , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will now grow again or go back in the long term , and possibly together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if these researchers fail to decline the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ eberg , so in recent decades , there have been very many sk@@ ating of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
this long strip of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the research programme of the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the polar surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has declined around 28 000 km2 in the 1950s . &quot;
the decline has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula in the past 50 years have been war@@ med by about three degrees , and in order to reach the areas where the temperature at the fastest time . &quot;
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free there , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Krem@@ lin has caught 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now once again 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
about 6@@ 20 applications have been reported for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is continuing to cope with the raised demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 jobs in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; searched for among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now want to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and join the skilled workers in the administration .
the administration is intended to develop a concept for personnel management and personnel development after the wish of the parties . &quot;
&quot; goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of experts , but forward @-@ oriented of the application shortage , it says . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ site and include an image @-@ based sive , call CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sometimes sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has it to do with personnel problems , which you previously did not know . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a down@@ right &quot; Competition of the public employer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age , comes from the service . &quot;
&quot; so , the highest time for action so that no more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; now , Klaus @-@ Dieter People , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond his party to the common request . &quot;
&quot; he did not care for a worth@@ less surprise in the creative day , when he publicly asked the staff of the staff of the public and the other parties stun@@ ned . &quot;
peoples wants to be checked for all possibilities that enable a res@@ ignation from the local employer association .
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the administration of the trade unions - maybe also in collaboration with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a hood , &quot; so nations . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U , the employees and officials try to pay better than we are actually looking for the Public Service for the Public Service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money is only when you move into a higher level that is oriented in professional years . &quot;
&quot; however , the tasks of the circle has grown more and more in recent years . &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established where employees are concerned about the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , land@@ owners Thomas Hend@@ ri@@ mp and Kreis@@ direc@@ torate Martin Richter has a problem : they have too few personnel . &quot;
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ating the tone to NGO @-@ migrants &apos; rescue operations
&quot; Italy has given NGOs , the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this , if they do not stick to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not write a new code of code , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ es &apos; , because their team has worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been operating in operation for one year , refused to speak for detailed pre@@ clu@@ es of the Italian Public Pro@@ secutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that at the moment we are unable to operate in the search and rescue operations , &quot; &quot; said the Organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can see all accus@@ ations , which are currently raised only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had re@@ viewing the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ es &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his occupation is taking tu@@ b@@ y migrants on board , which can be delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers and that the smu@@ g@@ gler can be used to restore the ships again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting occurred only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Pro@@ secutor , which was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , over the authority of the Italian coast guard , b@@ ail@@ out in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not supervised by any other motiv@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must have above all taken an Italian police officers on board who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far explained to keep up to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter told the new rules as unnecessary , but acceptable as they would be considered no &quot; essential changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Minn@@ iti said today that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy , in recent weeks , that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with the local citizens master fruits . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
An@@ u@@ sions and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ker bikers , the &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the northern Palat@@ inate , in order to enjoy four days of Tri@@ als and attractions . &quot;
there were three liber@@ ated guides available for this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led by hot summer temperatures along the vineyards for Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there are viewing points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ alz forest and the down@@ stream planes . &quot;
in between there was always a longer time @-@ shift for the long tri@@ bun@@ als .
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the People &apos;s Festival .
&quot; again , view point at the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ or@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate sei@@ zing . &quot;
on the last two days there were again a lot of altitude meters .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and fri@@ dges made welcome p@@ auses . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim breath@@ ed the bi@@ ker in the open @-@ air cur@@ ative Sole Sole .
also New@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and nearly 4@@ 500 meters meters , the group had the Pf@@ alz forest from its best side - sporty and culturally - met . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga retro@@ fit for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars be sitting in the future before computer consoles instead of fighting with wind and weather across the stadium ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognised the first federal government , which are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in the middle of July an e @-@ sport department , and two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze new young audiences in the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain that on this train , he will climb several clubs . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA @-@ World Cup launched the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven are qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to argue especially with the 14 to 30 years of age , that young people still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs try to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract could be present online by far more often in these markets than once a year to send the German Bundesliga to Asia .
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or are the football simulation of FIFA on competitive level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in normal sports , Li@@ ves have established itself , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and from the Asian countries , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a right sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly funk@@ y . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ber has long been dealing with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because he is competitive and showing many biological and physical reactions which one can also find in classical sports - for example increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; additionally , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ ous can also see problems : &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult in online @-@ games , and in the scene missing the structures of classical sports . &quot;
positive highlights the scientists the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; the players are on the international road , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study conducted in the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly for advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
sales will be at 130 million in three years .
the Bundesliga is little against the nearly 2.8 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , write the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ er . &quot;
international are many countries already .
large markets are Asia and the US where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton &apos;s Kut@@ cher has invested in the e@@ Sport @-@ Competition Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe things are doing some things .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a lecture , &quot; says F@@ rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the soccer league associations according to D@@ utt is now oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ ging &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to fall only in nostal@@ gia and to clear the old days , it is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the association , but the company at the same time align themselves on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we are living in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can not stick to this , that just playing football everything remains as it always was . &quot;

&quot; Michelle Carter because of the lyrics , the Con@@ rad Roy pushed to suicide . &quot;
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by lyrics and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed on par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June due to the casual killing of Con@@ rad Roy , which took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ acked .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter has allowed to stay free to appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum of 20 years but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy has suffered from a mental disease .
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cre@@ me@@ yer Bl@@ use , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down down eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have brought Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the Ombud@@ sper@@ son to the Court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it has no repentance . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said , it is a &quot; terrible circumstance that it is completely regre@@ tt@@ able . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor read a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there was &quot; no day in which I do not mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try , despite all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us , for His sisters , says it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would never follow her brother &apos;s wedding , she will never be part of her brother &apos;s wedding , or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this only person to have with which I was together for my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep forever with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to place a legal preced@@ ent since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to impose another suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy has found dead from a coal oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case attracted national attention , after Car@@ rier &apos;s text statements revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; take you up , Spring of a building , erst@@ e@@ che yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she told in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide wrote them , &quot; You have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy , and urged them to benefit by any press by the case . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; at the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was condemned in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserve compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to start at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern doesn &apos;t trust the Con@@ fed Cup winner a big season - Extra motivation .
&quot; what was different from his place in the cabin , that looked Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even if the extra clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself a share of the arm at his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
well the objection could have been better running than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from Coach could also indicate me so .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen by youth players , de@@ pra@@ ys and straight from vacation to existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he was chosen . &quot;
&quot; sugar be@@ aks are distributed on the dearest one , those that you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; thus , who was chosen to compete the legacy of Lah@@ m can only use a small extra motivation . &quot;
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday fl@@ atten@@ ed the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
&quot; at the right back , that is now his position , the white bonds at the arm did their rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ ber@@ ing me in this start @-@ formation like the one who can also take the best in his hand . &quot;
he gave instructions to draw the un@@ folded tro@@ upe .
&quot; he had the look for the whole , while many others engaged in themselves . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al therewith , his missing fitness to over@@ play ( til@@ ated hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches to tie on Dev@@ ils to tie out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( til@@ ated only moder@@ ately ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le in order to fall neg@@ atively on their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
all at all it worked pretty well .
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ mir , Ru@@ dy ran before the defense , both agile and sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well occupied Nap@@ oli storm did very difficult , in addition , South Africa tried a few times successfully in the game building . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy indeed gave that the result &quot; was not that way as we hoped for .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern @-@ World is still available for the New Zealand , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy was not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ me adopted a couple of cris@@ p statements on the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard a interesting phrase here , &quot; &quot; what goes down here , I have already noticed now . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new things any more . &quot;

company satisfied with the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ ton@@ ic Minister : economy lo@@ bt Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; it was often im@@ irre@@ conc@@ il@@ ably , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still economic Minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this shows itself after more than one year , where the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ acks the old secretary at the same time .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , president of the Association of Tri@@ er Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes the wishes of the economy to be blocked by Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest K@@ ehr@@ er sees Nat@@ us in infra@@ structural politics : the mosquito @-@ closure of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Adenauer does not stand up in the ranking list of the country .
&quot; even this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 the building should be right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west @-@ walk of the Tri@@ er who is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan .
&quot; the goal is to take the route in December 2020 in operation , says governor Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( Chamber of Commerce ) Tri@@ er strives to make the wine an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label , in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for the past ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing have an open ear for people who want to form an own company , lo@@ bt the Chamber of Commerce . &quot;
the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces says managing director Matthias Schwal@@ bach .
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro for the constitu@@ ent mastery and 2500 Euro , when graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in case of the planned road construction , be quick facts to create , at the same time lacking the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , main business leader of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set the wi@@ sing at national mobility mobility , so far only 29 places are occupied . &quot;
the Chamber calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
CD@@ U @-@ presidents Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations of the invoice where the country invested capital in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the conservation of inland water@@ ways .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country , as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
C@@ ern@@ bri@@ ety is also the previous broad@@ band building in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with 3,4 . &quot;
you compl@@ ained about de@@ pot internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ Economic Minister of E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of policy and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green @-@ Group left the Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months it has already returned the field again after four months . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 6,@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - Aut@@ oh@@ er@@ ers see themselves confronted with a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer software to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said , the company is the opinion that there are intelligent options as a constra@@ int , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to ban or limiting . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call .
&quot; &quot; &quot; European automobile manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to provide compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot;
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , which are diesel engines , are considered to be car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , plants for the neutr@@ alization of diesel vehicles to install exhau@@ st@@ asy , also take advantage of what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged to dist@@ res@@ cu@@ ddle the powerful car firms and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices , which could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal travel conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several trials of Volkswagen were charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen after the authorities have accused a system to deal with emission regulations in Europe and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could be Volkswagen hard to strain : the luxury automobile manufacturer contributes significantly to the profit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , there is a raft through Munich on Monday Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if it moves on Saturday the is@@ ar again on Saturday , there will be a big raft across there between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ bridge . &quot;
&quot; and that is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar @-@ tourists . &quot;
but the building &apos;s abstract wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ otran@@ sm@@ al .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a public campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True Love is ... &quot; shall the understanding of the Is@@ ar as protective game flow sharp@@ ens .
&quot; already in the last summer , the raft on Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and actions to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ us@@ n@@ oses , and the laughter against the suffering &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was one of the most recognised carto@@ ons carto@@ on@@ ists , the rab@@ bits of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still paints and works in a film .
&quot; his message : lau@@ ghing , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ate Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
during the first years as an artist he proposed himself among other things as a sign for happiness cards - what was frustrated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after the stops in Lima , New York and Paris ended at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
and again the artist is inspired by the artists .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ ble in drawings with the shooting tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning , he is still sitting at the character of the drawing , working on a daily basis for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; about Calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , Pl@@ ush @-@ animals and watches are continuing to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; the main people in the film &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular animal in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ box as a counter player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is expected to come to the chin wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is more focused on the TV series , who , like its original desig@@ nations , will be produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence on climate change
&quot; he became a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is due to the conditions of dro@@ wn conditions and due to illness @-@ borne insects decl@@ ines which scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the agricultural research Institute , CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant in recent years has been exposed to the impacts of climate change and in autumn much more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria , which transm@@ its the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ ade , and with very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
lav@@ ender oil is not only available for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant drilling with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; among the solutions that are considered to be considered a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the embro@@ ider@@ y of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of sorts , which are resistant to dro@@ ught . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce normally meet to check out their plans for the coverage of the latest chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by the organized crime against corruption and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security . &quot;
it was told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with granite or to leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters , name for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abdom@@ inal . &quot;
&quot; there are drugs boats , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , journalists , who are suspi@@ cious to stand on the salary list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no retirement from the violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses accum@@ ulate , more and more journalists are at the same time : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ ver participated in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there has been at least seven deaths in seven states this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editors and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Val@@ dez , which shows its mid @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hanging his mid @-@ year , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although in 2010 a Son@@ der @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ gler was built , in order to process the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee started to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; with Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are un@@ tr@@ end@@ ent and even though the terrain is now more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting held a little benefit for discussion of security , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the Why , we mis@@ trust all . &quot;
in the morning of the 15th of May Val@@ dez has left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; he only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was hal@@ ted by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot upon him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ d &quot; river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius went away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to wander freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an freely .
but on the topic Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country as rival political groups are struggling to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people are shot on the road , or that the cemetery is full of ver@@ ted , two @-@ story mou@@ th@@ ole@@ ans for drug lovers , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &apos; peace &apos; , if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs business routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , is co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interviews with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the sons , suspected G@@ ang@@ ers purchased each copy of the output once they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country into its own security . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he has survived so long that his friends and colleagues are saying that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined forces with five colleagues in the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journalism , without b@@ anning the noise issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; in time , the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it to publish tough meetings without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could handle . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of the Mexican drug history , wherever it goes . &quot;
he gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living &quot; , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in October . &quot;
&quot; you have to take the task of falling as a journalist , either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in the face of so many things ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the spa@@ wning @-@ bird , who was like a harbour @-@ bird , the friend , the generous with hu@@ gs and ratings , a teacher that knew how to survive . &quot;
you trusted in his routine .
he would always bear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now she is asking : was his love for the routine , his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on the question of how they can best do their work , and remain alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ starting and cross @-@ paths , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ keeping . &quot;
to trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it is wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; &quot; smell become a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
&quot; the ancient rules , as he and others say , apply in Sin@@ alo@@ a no more - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a poison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for security training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before has been announced that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two poli@@ c@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ storey building of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen , which the Governor itself was not trusted . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are really under control . &quot;
for the output of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has opened on three main stories .
it gave the assassination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending that focused on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was one group , which resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so it was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter took from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy , who ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man departed a military attack . &quot;
only a few months before the readers had viewed the Kolum@@ ba of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slim physique . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was devoted to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers to protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter &apos;s Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez sn@@ aps up a few characters , and went the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing , that it is his . &quot;
all over the country journalists have become sound@@ ly stronger by organising them in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on o@@ bedience and constructions .
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to pick up journalists and bring them to the truth , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked since then that she is group@@ ed again by the government , because it is concerned that their anger has violated its objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved in government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter will not only be killed by drugs , but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the media &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has reported more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you give because they want you to keep the mouth shut up , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
&quot; nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as , in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago . &quot;
&quot; your body was found together with a note , which supposedly was signed by the Z@@ etas box : &quot; &quot; I am here because of my reports . &quot;
a computer sheet and head@@ phones next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Nor@@ te , in the northern border of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others go on as there did El Man@@ ana from Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the murder of their director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly directed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have flo@@ wn out of their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find jobs in exile , and they still watch the roads and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they will be hun@@ ted , as it was apparently murdered with the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , indicates that the drug trafficking is scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and that is why I was re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drink beer , as at once all their phones began to sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
a series of sho@@ wer@@ ies with Band@@ enri@@ ching and security forces near the bath@@ or@@ tes Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war has continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the on @-@ board cutting edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce about cell phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ts near - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the poli@@ cem@@ an the guards held to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose Middle @-@ finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day when Javier was murdered , the tra@@ inee asked me to send it to the road to the road . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used fl@@ age to differ from its enemies .
at first sight it looks like a statue even though a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible age of Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his g@@ imm@@ ed skin of red@@ dish that was - and they said , they could have had something from a &quot; &quot; rude past . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the circumc@@ ised din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier , who lived in the middle of the chal@@ k time between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed Plant t@@ ore is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something , which appeared from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to see more accurately . &quot;
the fossil was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to un@@ cover heavy ground . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re just a little blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientists at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is seen . &quot;
it will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s - the Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
&quot; researchers have found that this vegetable @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a armor and a changing tank , probably served by meat and send din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age , in order to hide from predat@@ ors , and used an sealing technology that is used as a counter @-@ cre@@ mation that is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to devi@@ ate its enemies , say to what suggests that it was threatened by major din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ er has been headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta marking Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing maintenance of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and arm@@ aments over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ gra@@ dations , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ teeth is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is far beyond that of the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted from enough pressure by meat , the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted that the evolution fav@@ ored the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of contemporary animals that use counter @-@ gra@@ dations - think of deer , z@@ ebras or g@@ ages - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real struggle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong car@@ ni@@ vor@@ y behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors must have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s rot@@ brown was .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life , including its preserved display , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sun@@ k on the back to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alberta had become so warm as South @-@ rivers today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with a contaminated skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal is almost like the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you do not need to use much fantasy to re@@ construct it . if you only play a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , as huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ r , who stood on two legs to go through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus rex , millions of years lived after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ tive ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ ig@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and is m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k , when he was on March 21 , 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum it is the terrac@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle up to the hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops , that ra@@ ined from his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed Plant Bre@@ e@@ ater has been damaged by the western Canada , until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s kept its armor in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy pan@@ eling along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confusing it will be . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied res@@ te of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank @-@ plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his former head @-@ foot is located on his side , his five fingers are tigh@@ tened up . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : mass kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many Ver@@ sions
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in mass @-@ car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , long @-@ long rod - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) on Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people have been injured .
&quot; according to the first information provided by the police , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were under a thunder@@ bolt of almost 30 cars , including a truck , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; at first , there is no information on the exact number of entries . &quot;
it is an easy to medium @-@ difficult injuries , a poli@@ ce@@ way said . &quot;
a big buzz of ambul@@ ance vehicles has been at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was fully locked in direction of Munich .
&quot; in the driving force of Munich , there was approximately ten kilometres long back . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z @-@ re@@ porter reports , it also came on the bac@@ kl@@ ash to massive disabilities - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; fire bri@@ ga@@ des quoted the marks of the vehicle , who now have to count with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , then another accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; thereby , there was a collision between an automobile sports and a car . &quot;
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the road to an accident place .
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing else is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or you are pl@@ ung@@ ed into his work and has just one ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and ar@@ ouses an impro@@ per or irrit@@ ating the driver middle out of your work@@ flow .
card control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are coming soon .
the German railways are currently the procurement card control .
it simply confirms the phone that you have taken its place and de@@ values the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer is , we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany for many more remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; calls the railway the chassis without Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to booked an online ticket - what already do most passengers do .
&quot; you must also have purchased it via the app &apos;s app , the DB Navigator software , which is the most convenient way of ticket bookings . &quot;
and finally you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works so : one climb@@ s to the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
with the test customers there will be a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the traction leaders get a message on their mobile devices a message that driver X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y Y .
&quot; comes the train companion in passing card control to square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already a valuable online ticket . &quot;
&quot; you can thus continue to sleep , continue to be silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who wants to relaxed without ticket control by our train @-@ accompanying staff , check the DB Navigator simply yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time on the train of personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Manager of DB Fern@@ s . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that besides delays and pas@@ sers , the card controls are one of the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow travellers does not take all documents that you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
&quot; either lacking the credit card or of the personal ID or otherwise a document , you must advance . &quot;
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train companion and suspension , which leads to worse atmosphere in the section or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner at the end time takes time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that is only on the ICE line 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
another traction numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken to its core .
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , the one sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that rented it and sc@@ roll@@ ed by Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled across a post of someone from the high school .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else had posted on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saving on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , a un@@ armed black 18 year @-@ old who was killed by a white poli@@ c@@ emen in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
&quot; he po@@ sted a picture of bro@@ wns &apos;s naked body , which was stretched on the road and stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ et over people on the Can@@ field drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who affir@@ ms to his master &apos;s father , who carried a shield with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live fe@@ ed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was faced with a group of demonstrators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , a different poli@@ cem@@ an said his gun and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all killing . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell . &quot;
that is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and which we can say typical .
in that moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ z .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
you booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 year old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened during the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a history of survival and Protest@@ es , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge the answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two are talking , that they had countless occasions in this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember , as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you need to know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience , in which she personally experienced no ek@@ lat@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them far away . &quot;
&quot; the first stop , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp@@ ground , considered the activists to the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there are Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and hal@@ ves to pass them on prot@@ esters .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after the 9th of August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on Es@@ sens justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had no experience in organizing . &quot;
it has all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to the meaning of Fer@@ rell : &quot; &quot; do you want to document it , or tries to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; these scep@@ ticism was nourished by countless cases of people , often by white men in a community who benefited from their pain and their resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an explained recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , whose voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area that is known for his activ@@ ism by To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought us closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; in the years to Brooklyn . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we speak , &quot; &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for this is how I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is at the movement &quot; &quot; not to get a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open place in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the Menshevi@@ k of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ er &apos;s story repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black @-@ lives @-@ Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; by Martin in 2012 , identify the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , and therefore we are constantly struggling on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it exists , however , that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ist type of action , chosen in the he@@ ap due to its identity as the heart of film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person that stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no coincidence although it was on the front line , because with a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel her energy by the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long ago disappeared , but the rac@@ ist connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of the block@@ age of a highway on a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which they call their homes : &quot; a mess . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless she cl@@ ed up with a song and she feels obliged to her mind , since she went into F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the road three years ago . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; to say one to the bit @-@ gallery , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a man &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ ts ) or quite plain : &quot; &quot; scale W@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advocates are building that a gallery draws more customers to the city , the other stores will benefit , fear the opponents that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant market stands , in which 13 direct market commerci@@ als . &quot;
with the start of construction work will be the conclusion .
&quot; Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and indeed , for Bed@@ a @-@ square , with possibility to sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ ings always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .
there is also the same in other cities .
&quot; above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; whether direct market commerci@@ als in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; however , the situation is likely to be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why Shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; if clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
of this there are enough in our city .
one sees how many shop stores are left empty - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least keeping us at least the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly from the producer and is well @-@ priced . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , Lad@@ in stores will be rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the dor@@ sal r@@ ents are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops there is almost no more and what still exists , will probably even disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a Mark@@ thalle fits not together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market hall during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come . &quot;
&quot; or does it create the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery already , to sell all the shops of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a Shopping Center , which stands empty , does not need anyone . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to support a real farm market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmers market hall , it is thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg does not place any more . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ compar@@ ably identical - that hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the earlier secrecy a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after it made public as a secret , diplomatic reports on the website Wiki@@ Le@@ aks . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A suitable similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was united to their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking thesis , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as if someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data might look like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman since its pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accus@@ ations , including six bre@@ aches of the spi@@ der law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; the prison was sup@@ pressed their image , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting at a riding seat and a plat@@ o@@ blonde is associated with it . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just coming from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in this , the artist portrait of strangers made from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts like cigarette lighter and che@@ wing g@@ um , by extract the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they brought an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press release of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were sent to an un@@ equal bril@@ liance , which has been several letters exchanged during the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ics &apos; sup@@ pressed Images , who would like to convert a future in which the Chel@@ onia &apos;s decision would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy encounter . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat low@@ land , and st@@ ark@@ es , since Donald Tr@@ ump performs a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender @-@ troops to find new , twe@@ e@@ tive paths that he should actually fix , further on . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , after the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen to happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a wall written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for cre@@ ing with their over@@ sized signature among them ( the &quot; &quot; i &quot; &quot; in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end of the automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis , gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ fü@@ ß@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , like amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in organic ways , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above com@@ ic no@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how they re@@ pl@@ unge with a free @-@ hand el@@ ef@@ on in the hand from the discipl@@ in@@ sight@@ seeings of the United States such as King @-@ Hong Kong .
&quot; if they dict@@ ate your speech , then they have won &quot; , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was pre@@ viewed in the Com@@ ic@@ book , but when they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ ren , who together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pose@@ ful , as everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic data groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowds &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which tasted even behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford for kill@@ ings
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injury . &quot;
on Monday we were issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ self ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest on Monday because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one by the police authority of Chicago published in Chicago , states that the Lei@@ che was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials got a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim to several injury on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau has yet been declared dead at the place of the action for dead , and det@@ ectives the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police active after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been a professor of micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president for university relationships , said in an e @-@ mail explaining that La@@ ish should now be out of absence and being ruled by the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal issue studied by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ i . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail explaining that &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help the U.S. investigation authorities in every conceivable way .
&quot; the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens were shocked , and want it to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , he urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alise them , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , which was that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ them@@ self and war@@ es were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long until the remaining criteria of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this regard , &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause Russia issues . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria referred to in the above criteria however shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of the W@@ ada approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , state @-@ funded de@@ op@@ ings in the Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we are leading the investigation since our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system had made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; mut@@ ation words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has before , to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; put Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the wake of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ als from W@@ ada by the execution of D@@ op@@ ing@@ controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main square of the organization in Moscow in July W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA is moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

&quot; the start @-@ ups , which are going to help your business not to become the next one &quot;
Amy Deli@@ ver wanted to measure the happiness in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you fail anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; he said In@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has brought people from outside to help .
a new race of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on the wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software , which has the specific purpose of the measurement of employee engagement , it allows companies to address surveys , special groups and demographic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wers allow to use the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for the pursuit of their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; she said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think , and in the three years he won with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap @-@ pol@@ ls and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives may have low popularity results - so that you can drill down , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you have not been the next u@@ ber that has been embo@@ died in Sk@@ and@@ ale since its former employee describes a blog post , who have spoken an environment of Bel@@ ts , where those who have spoken . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility .
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value in 2020 , according to the financing technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity beginning this year in the midst of u@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting company lets send custom @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the warmth and maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employee &apos;s employees . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it may be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , worker &apos;s fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant @-@ chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , convertible convertible for more than one year to make sure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; previously , if a cler@@ k wanted to report a problem , he or she will find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the corporate headquarters to submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to trace the complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; now , since the company Conver@@ ting to use Conver@@ cent , you can have problems that were previously covered by managers , which were hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unauthorized intern@@ ships , quickly identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who deri@@ ves the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employees involvement in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they did not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of firms such as S@@ apphire Vs and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was lifted to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; at $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , as well as its entire financing brought to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
there is an increasing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than before .
in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you will give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are glad to be in a company , feeling their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , then they feel more strongly committed to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which are both Conver@@ cent as well as G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors arrive very well if their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well if employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you can find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment to the experts of workplace culture is important .
&quot; however , the data are useless if the administrator of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks people after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes are on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be willing to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company , who have left themselves too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the employees themselves , &quot; did you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and whom do you not have to worry about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who is now through monthly employees surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , she was able to re @-@ organise and add multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of workers in a sector that is known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ days practices and makes a long day for the break
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ CL@@ A football players on one side of the new practice areas of the team are talking on campus .
some have drawn their tri@@ ck@@ nesses and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team put these un@@ paid minutes a lunch break .
&quot; players who are inscri@@ bed themselves up to the summer courses , will return after the three @-@ hour exercise , before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said brood @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ days exercises to facilitate the burden of players and she has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A should start at 19 : 15 o &apos;clock to meet the already packed tim@@ ings of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day , at which the brood postponed the beginning of the Camp@@ s almost one week after the last season and during the summer school during the summer season , during the summer season , during the summer season , during the summer time during the summer season . &quot;
they are to be held in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of the formal toys for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the rules of N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have just crossed it , they plac@@ ings on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think as soon as we arrive until Saturday and we have more time , it will really be magnificent . &quot;
&quot; U@@ CL@@ A will finish their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear si@@ len@@ ies of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class , which has already been a protective network behind a door@@ posts , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a place that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room and then adjust it there . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video ob@@ and from a practice , it is a fairly good deal . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I do not worry too much about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit det@@ ector to third parties , and show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called f@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counterf@@ eit@@ ers and to send it to billing det@@ ector , which may display results of the Fak@@ ams from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe they also influenced the U.S. presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue , whereby the French voters are flooded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May , and Germany will support a plan , according to social media networks , as they do not succeed , h@@ water @-@ filled post@@ ings , as before the elections there in September quickly . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in English , that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to knowledge , which stories are challenged by the fact that people want more context to make well @-@ founded decisions about what they read and share , &quot; Sarah S@@ u , Produc@@ man@@ ag@@ erin , for Facebook @-@ News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; link &quot; &quot; link to other changes to his News @-@ Fe@@ ed to reduce incorrect news . &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the small Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video , and was a hiding hole for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ er and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy office in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historic documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who is dead for 300 years , &quot; he says we@@ ave . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos;s Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double @-@ agent in the 1700 @-@ 0s which he worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thum@@ b pressure !
&quot; and letters always cried out to smoke , for then they made a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives up to 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love Archive ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten up with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England ( To be honest about four months ) in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have survived my welcome gru@@ dge a little over &quot; ) , this seems to be true to be true . &quot;
Rhodes spent his days exploring the vi@@ kt@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle to study the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and talked with land @-@ fle@@ ction , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank , whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust was first received full access in 2006 than the last one , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees started to take care of the archive he said as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , Cast it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English emp@@ ires , those who possessed : &quot; you might think that country conflict would be boring , &quot; &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ke to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant stand of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a turmoil that appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
the farm arose in this area and I thought was an uprising was a good start .
maybe the two are connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that told the history of the Jesu@@ it the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; in which the smu@@ g@@ gler from the 18th century symbol@@ ised his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later than his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated .
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite cro@@ ok , getting back debts and spend money for things that they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men solve their debt crises , by paying rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys before , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment at the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique write experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ sm@@ el@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has been re@@ claimed again since by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; ah , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef was launched on Friday its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
until Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep the logo and the slogan secret by Nelson Ar@@ tz .
at the end of August there should be a celebration of the campaign on the island Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their official site . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make clear that man@@ ches is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we as a bath tank citizens want to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; in the action it &apos;s going to be more than &apos; just &apos; a logo and a slogan , it says on . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able single occasion . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
&quot; the small five @-@ digit amount will be the town of Bad Honnef , its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost . &quot;
military re@@ forming in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear in front of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara to the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on retirement and respon@@ dents in the officer &apos; officers .
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup .
&quot; the meeting took place no more in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the Government , the five Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ ers as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , justice and foreign affairs participated . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ as were in the number of survivors . &quot;
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; Chief Executive Officer Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y were put off . &quot;
since the failed Cou@@ p did Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , Erdo@@ gan as a wire making of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who were immediately involved in the coup d &apos;@@ One , will be engaged in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of Erdo@@ gan as a &quot; divine gift , &quot; as he would give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan has really control the army in hand ?
at the end of February the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the heading &quot; un@@ eas@@ iness in the military @-@ headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in general , there &apos;s concerns for a growing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , in the lifting of the head of the head , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big cleaner in the army and security guards continues to go on .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan run further 7@@ 3@@ 95 heads of State , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
and it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they were calling on their role as a guardian of the secular state .
&quot; after his election in 2002 Erdo@@ gan managed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for reform@@ ism in the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan driving specifically to the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; a specifically un@@ named officer who searched for asylum from persecution abroad for asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges in doubt on the use of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the legal immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a perpet@@ ual work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do so by the US will change the way the citizens from other countries of Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new candidate procedure will benefit the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to combine track for racing and re@@ conditioning
&quot; over the past few months again , over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les were denied - now it is possible to walk very quickly . &quot;
&quot; even before the end of the year , at the m@@ aro@@ den track , on which the tourist run@@ way is going to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing car sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , according to the traffic Department I will begin working on track in this year . &quot;
&quot; by making the decision to order and san@@ e the route from Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ g , the country knows itself to this especially important for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared the Under@@ secretary of Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; the costs of the repairs of the distance , he adapted to about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; by this sum , the country take over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which basis the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently conclu@@ sive , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern bank as operators were already agreed upon the technical details .
&quot; this is the timetable that negotiated vehicles and quality standards , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the scheduled contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the racing car shuttle will be ordered in December 2017 .
the racing shuttle shuttle is a popular rail link between the train stations in Il@@ men@@ au and racing .
&quot; in the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot company , whether the range of sufficient many people is used to order them in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 there will be a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots .
&quot; yes , in fact . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots during the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ bos@@ sed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start to take her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le , and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves fun over them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adapt to his robot according to his convic@@ tions , and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but there will be more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; , &quot; which would be a Step@@ ford woman progression . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ghts have developed to robots with a silicon skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties which they find appealing to , such as sh@@ amp@@ ness . &quot;
and then there is still the un@@ written ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold sex robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; who gives the impression of relap@@ sing and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; war@@ med the website of True companion . &quot;
&quot; they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it may be tired of being fixed on conversation , or it can be &quot; in the mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many troubled aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ scores on rape , when you take a step to Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : contradic@@ ting ) Far@@ rah , be@@ ek@@ ey a most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True is True Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibration , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men then not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , this sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex play . &quot;
their emergence and its increasing sophistic@@ ation in a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture to retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional addition to sex .
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ alises their growing popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of Consumer Culture . &quot;
&quot; but what perme@@ ates from the edge zones , can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until they give their permission to them .
&quot; there is a certain remn@@ ants that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has ge@@ ta@@ iled to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
the ab@@ omin@@ ous aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that dis@@ car@@ ded bodies and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star @-@ proportions ) .
their pe@@ ers want them to feel human as they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
you cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no placement or a background story , nothing , which could hin@@ ge on independence or anything , which could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
other words : they are counterf@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : ma@@ ids
umps big performance ?
he does Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human being
&quot; it has become a bin@@ o@@ y@@ ness of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized the US constitu@@ encies , also split up families in small @-@ format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest time , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump into your relative relative . &quot;
we all said to us all allegedly to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power Tr@@ umps , families together . &quot;
&quot; I chose this , because my C@@ ousine is a left @-@ minded poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visits me this week in New York . &quot;
it reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone knows which she knows , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite especi@@ al on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls with me in another context that this will also bring considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the stell@@ ating effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ el@@ ly way that his mosquit@@ oes of one day could no longer be b@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a long @-@ proof long @-@ term scenario , in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to his standards as a sense of reasonable . &quot;
&quot; today , I find myself nowadays from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s premi@@ ered version of Ver@@ d@@ ging - the dog on the car , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement looked at ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when l@@ ump passes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans must be intellectu@@ ally healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the vor@@ us@@ ells of the New York park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city , if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass design on the central cylinder - all of the clo@@ wns are scarce and the animals revol@@ ve to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ making music conve@@ ys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many Kl@@ is@@ che@@ es of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are being old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience , as here are two years old , a 11 @-@ year old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have seen the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before reading my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my road , it is the same , plus the option to get the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this leads not only to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exercise pressure on the server in order to bring personality to a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ usable , while I get tired of experience to reach her my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us shared with chest pain in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for an ambul@@ ance visit .
&quot; last year he was transferred to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his wr@@ ists , which he suffered prison authorities after a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ enti@@ us was condemned to a call of pro@@ secut@@ ors for the first death sentence due to murder of the pro@@ secut@@ ors .
&quot; he k@@ ills Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day , by taking them several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly inv@@ ader , hidden in the cabin . &quot;
the pro@@ secut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal to which they say they are too short @-@ sighted .
&quot; the National Bank Authority said that they will rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection can be heard this year . &quot;
guns is going to be danger that his sentence increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold a strange egg finds
&quot; as the last of the Bul@@ berger schools , the four @-@ four @-@ cler@@ ks from F@@ ays and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into the holidays and into the continuing schools . &quot;
three of the students go to the high school in the future .
Schul@@ er Angel@@ ica Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of school leaving the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Meder a young eagle , which is growing in the chicken , but then the freedom is released . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the m@@ ist Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; Der Adler in the chicken . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it from his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making it a chicken , sh@@ attered , the eagle grew up on a high mountain its wings , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the hen danced with the young legs , the cylin@@ ders bore , around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; young is indeed different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but belonging to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
&quot; his purpose is to be free . &quot;
&quot; they wished every four @-@ quarters , that he feels accepted in his new school . &quot;
&quot; it followed acceptance of the colleagues , the earlier school leader Michael Müller , who is again and again under teaching @-@ gyp@@ sy , and the parent representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is now over , the classroom Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of lessons very often , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students had a song of summer time and time . &quot;
this was great pleasure during the children .
for the new school year eight first @-@ cler@@ ks are already registered .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were de@@ tained for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally celebrated people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day they were released , while currently an investigation has been running . &quot;
&quot; the State Department reported b@@ TV , that the Bulg@@ arians were later released . &quot;
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free Camp@@ s and place every one who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , has substantial money pen@@ alties . &quot;
controls will be continued during the whole season .
the ministry said that the court can hang a fine .
software update for diesel cars : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
will diesel drivers take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel @-@ Summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group software updates have been offered for a total of around 5.@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are intended to improve the emissions of emissions of emissions from Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives income :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the compulsory updates previously only apply to the vehicles , the Schum@@ mel@@ software , &quot; &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
their retro@@ fit has arranged the dri@@ ve@@ way ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast @-@ day implementation in the coming months , but still not mentioned a precise date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write every person concerned .
&quot; in any case an inspection is due , it will be done in their frame . &quot;
how long should the change fit in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this is defined by the level of commitment from the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily act the car manufacturers on the subject of the environment so far not . &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the re@@ armament itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do motor@@ ists do , who are not driving a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE betra@@ ys the wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would prefer to re@@ join , such as S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price dis@@ integration of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE was afraid that .
&quot; but , just in the regions where hair loss dro@@ w . &quot;
in rural areas there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
&quot; the ACE can be seen , with a sale yet to be seen . &quot;
ll C@@ ool J receives Kennedy Center @-@ Award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
&quot; the first prize @-@ giving under President Tr@@ ump promises to become politically , politically . &quot;
one of the winners will not come - from protest .
ll C@@ ool J ( 49 ) gets first r@@ apper awarded one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the culmin@@ ation device announced on Thursday , this year also singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ on@@ el Rich@@ y ( 86 ) and the chore@@ ograp@@ her Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump will organize a welcome and participate together with his wife Mel@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; the winners with progressive TV series are announced today , which is therefore already announced , to participate in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; this presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to depri@@ ve them - and that they are deb@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed , she will use the interview with Tr@@ ump to make clear their view . &quot;
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Centre after former President John F. Kennedy , Kennedy @-@ Centre is the largest cult location in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; among the earlier prize winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Franklin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into pensions in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written , but suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been awarded .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conve@@ yed in the press interview .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , you have wondered that so far no application has received the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or a civil engineer at the next time .
&quot; thus , taking note of the regular termin@@ ations - not enough time for a single operation . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach acts for the administration of the Board of Directors as a sub @-@ law office , the applicant must advance relevant agreements . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they cannot fill them out more , the citizens would have to leave for advice until Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the closeness of the city and itself is important to him , &quot; says W@@ acker , who reports from a good company lim@@ a , as well as a good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the office of more than 30 years , some significant projects have accumulated to look back to the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is safe with the construction and his staff . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Dutch @-@ car@@ park are around . &quot;
&quot; the cinema bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium is still subject . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will strike up some 1.5 million euros to be@@ ech , &quot; &quot; if we &apos;re right , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
alternat@@ ing is available for a city construction of large room .
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own Bau@@ hof and gar@@ den@@ ei there can be quite flexible re@@ acted .
&quot; you can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye on what rein@@ forcement &quot; , &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the cre@@ ased city construction . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister carries high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s builders , &quot; in the end everything is going through my table here . &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ ticul@@ ture ) has been here for ten years since he has been Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep building ) for 15 years .
&quot; also that his successor remains long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good business climate , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
who would like to be@@ g Roland W@@ acker should report about the town of Has@@ l@@ ach a completed studies as a diploma @-@ ingenie@@ ur or Bachelor with specialty architecture and have good expertise in the field of construction and construction planning .
&quot; under the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt stand high and deep @-@ building , construction planning , cru@@ el@@ ong@@ ation affairs , management of urban property , municipal property with Bau@@ hof and Stadt@@ g@@ ärt@@ ner@@ ei as well as sub @-@ law authority including cognitive protection . &quot;
bike on lines cast : south @-@ way locked locked
&quot; according to police , the so far unknown perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bike from the railroad station in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were damaged so strongly that the her@@ ding freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male counterparts and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the Tat@@ ort were witnesses of a ros@@ ar@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bicycle rider have been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ stream , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
the perpetrators brought themselves in great danger even to the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; apart from the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant , as well as a long @-@ minute drive and the cost of rail transport you could also encounter P@@ ön@@ als of the train to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; altogether , to pass by a &quot; significant &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were re@@ medi@@ ed on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ way could be led without disability . &quot;
&quot; barely ten people have gone on Friday afternoon , two of them considered the distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; sl@@ ings were not removed , but they had no delay . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be replaced approximately 200 meters high @-@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammation , bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
rot@@ ate meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system such as a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , affecting some 1,3 million and in the United States 300@@ ,000 , causes gast@@ ric fights and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually getting rid of meat and milk products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins can help to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intestinal pat@@ rol to make sure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide themselves in the food , do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells , which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance goes too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , experiments has been found that a kind of tolerance with mice is found in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich food tolerant , less infl@@ amed intestinal lie@@ us encourages , if the same system also wir@@ es with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral researcher in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immun@@ isation that encourages the tolerance as it emerged that a group of study re@@ ws had such cells , but a different group of this tribe , which had not been separated , but that did not have . &quot;
&quot; they assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , which usually live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the no@@ ble@@ ms of the mice were set in DNA sequ@@ entially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were lacking in the mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment so that they were a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome , and they did not develop these kinds of immun@@ o@@ grams , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria carried out onto the immune system , the researchers of L. reu@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then over@@ threw small amounts of liquid , without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe imm@@ uni@@ cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ Met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as In@@ dol @-@ 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us are reu@@ ter@@ i in our g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products made of L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in people like with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , since these cells take inflammation on the internal surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; potentially , high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i at an extension of these population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United is committed with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , &quot; &quot; believes Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut in S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pounds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup launched against Real Madrid on Tuesday starts and impres@@ sing in the holder &apos;s role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira after expos@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC , however , was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , giving M@@ our@@ in@@ ho that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him earlier than later .
besides M@@ atic star@@ ters also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wished for three more new commitments , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; , &quot; three of its four prime ministers . &quot;
&quot; three of four to get , for this , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they have four of them four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. airplane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; pilots flew from Seattle in the US state Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Michigan and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers across the US , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was an instructor for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising already earlier .
&quot; the number &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky . &quot;
&quot; new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; how the wind turns out : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel still the SPD boss , looked at socio @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; only no stor@@ ks from the party central , just no contra@@ wind from the federal government - so was the most important wish of the constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt @-@ House closely monitor the events in the SPD state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach with counterpart . &quot;
there were deep attacks .
and indeed one by one .
the CD@@ U CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Greens .
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably &quot; , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising fac@@ tional fac@@ tions of a Greens refused to over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the landing elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its red @-@ green coalition to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ Bundes@@ verband Michael Kellner has called on the Shi@@ ün@@ de @-@ Sax@@ on Greens El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets to return their mandate .
the over@@ step towards the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to her mandate , &quot; said the Bundes@@ managing director and electoral campaigns of the Green Network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true yet , &quot; &quot; si@@ gh an SPD election champi@@ ons , than on Friday morning , the new hi@@ obs@@ message was reached by the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , is after crossing the green MEP El@@ ke T@@ west to CD@@ U without its own government . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD country .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down his comrades . &quot;
&quot; according to the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this then became clear - and everything was much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into diving , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ ite , and the party smooth . &quot;
lab@@ ori@@ ously attacks the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then when they had just got a new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with it came the next precip@@ itation .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD leader , lost his ni@@ bus in that weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did almost everything wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW car@@ bure@@ tor and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Prime Minister has already been in criticism . &quot;
mi@@ tig@@ ated transformations came from .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to get more and more strongly in the federal acc@@ ents last weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , his power in Berlin , did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
they allow him to grant him away from Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party of internal constraints , is basically no fault . &quot;
and Schulz does not at all at all .
sometimes the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed .
&quot; your wrath is directed towards the Greens , and here above all on the ni@@ gh@@ ni@@ ge parliament@@ arians in the west . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , as Mrs T@@ jack@@ ets her own career entry over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Party left in the SPD parliamentary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; MS T@@ jack@@ ets has not been elected as direct candidate , but also on the national list of the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Greens , the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would it be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , leader of the SPD member state , laments an &quot; &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD to the Bundestag election in the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now fal@@ si@@ fied the personal career result of a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clarify the background .
&quot; I want to know if it has been more , or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot;
Sup@@ porting Society III
who wants to re@@ join the house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ oring Stadt@@ development on Wednesday in received . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave a review to the previous one . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in delicate refurb@@ ishment .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment I from 1991 to 2004 , the land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the subsi@@ dy . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 the supplement was still at 60 percent .
&quot; for the in@@ dler , the existing sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote the interior design , and not only to tap into new building areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4th , we have received the information from the spokes@@ person of Karlsruhe on April 4 , that there will be a refurb@@ ishment region III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which were 500 000 euros from the country , the rest of the church . &quot;
how is a refurb@@ ishment ?
&quot; one will continue to examine such in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all interest , to san@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the d@@ enture will then also be able to post@@ p@@ one another . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; , &quot; in whose frame the renov@@ ations would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the rev@@ itali@@ zation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would refer object @-@ related , that is stated per plot . &quot;
the refurb@@ ishment area would finally be defined as a stat@@ ute .
the approval period for the funding period exp@@ ires since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; even until September this year , however , the survey would only be carried out at once , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area involved a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ ti@@ ation of the pro@@ clamation should be started in November or December , so that in the coming year will begin with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann explained that every Comm@@ une had to perform the said alleg@@ ations .
&quot; it is the reason why it is to evaluate and decide the cities of the city , when it comes to , and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property it will also be registered in the book book .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to you again , and get a picture of the situation , promised them . &quot;
Got@@ zel stressed : a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .
&quot; for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and plot of property &quot; , &quot; in which it goes among other things about the construc@@ tional state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and apartment arc , &quot; can information about size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; Oper@@ ator &quot; &quot; is only to fill in the building &apos;s premises . &quot;
&quot; however , to be observed , Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler said that the distribution of funding according to the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ ist principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , gr@@ ind at first . &quot;
&quot; you could not want to reserve a support for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to finish the photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a reconstruction &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor is itself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip , so that he can enter its door , and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant method is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chips and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company from North@@ am also wants to change the castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and for his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising cost of the White House costs the tax@@ payers of thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter drive to the South La@@ wn for an event that emerged American production in the last month , tax@@ payers charges according to the statements of the military , which have left the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on July 17th at the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and Chief officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was issued in Connecticut , was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in an frag@@ mentary order or FRA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the record of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the com@@ man@@ de@@ ur of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Nav@@ ek@@ om@@ man@@ de@@ ur for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 p.m. , and so long stayed until the la@@ wns between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed , due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would require for the return flight . &quot;
the original flight rate was found during the event at the helicopter while the safety of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records provided in TI@@ ME , it was not clear if ultimately a second flight plan was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act has nation@@ alized the state property for political purposes .
datas@@ ets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked whether the event could harm the determination .
&quot; a question which we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the Commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are closed , &quot; rep@@ lied to the comm@@ anding commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for reform of health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he pro@@ vision@@ ed the efforts to susp@@ ects government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , which is known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are obliged to use them for the journey .
&quot; but their use only for a photo operating , is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential plane in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enth@@ r@@ alled by the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states , who are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said vice president of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often lead training trips around Washington and South La@@ wn through to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; as a Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 , H@@ MX @-@ 1 was conducted in the White House 58 exercise land . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event marked for the month &apos;s training needs for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
hel@@ pers will be flo@@ wn in addition to 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential commission . &quot;
&quot; the White House said , tax@@ payers had no burden for any of the other re@@ pro@@ ps that were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said , the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not stop bud@@ get@@ table descriptions for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ and@@ ent@@ ari@@ d of the U.S. Defense Ministry for the Financial Year 2017 , the DO@@ D Group rate for the v@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24@@ 380 USD per flight lesson . &quot;
record of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ payers to determine on the basis of estimates for the creation of equipment , is most mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the costs of DO@@ D do not contain the costs for DO@@ D , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to showcase these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ icer . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the federal state , Connecticut , are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to be emphasized . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether tr@@ ump into the helicopter , when he joined the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the seat of a fire@@ man &apos;s seat . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and cher@@ ished with the media about his own fleet of corporate products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

step backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen facilities
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ mid@@ table and again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the urban nur@@ series the clock will be revers@@ ed .
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ series ( Kit@@ as ) back into their own . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Vice @-@ president in the Department of Youth Aid , this is good news : &quot; &quot; we are all very happy . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , cooked except house : a Cat@@ erer will take over this task and delivers fresh cool@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the city operates in the cre@@ ek area of 46 kinder@@ gart@@ ens , in 44 ones receive children at lun@@ ch@@ time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ yr , 2@@ 800 children sat down at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile not only children who are supervised by 45 Wo@@ lica , in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour support , if children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al forces have from 1 September kitchen service : they warm the guided meals , they supplement the salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food off , wash up and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees will be assigned to a han@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two groups together as well as seventy @-@ tro@@ op facilities - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; thus , they are much stronger involved and it is easier to implement the kite line , educational concepts . &quot;
that &apos;s why it is about healthy eating and cooking .
the kids are supposed to help the food to prepare .
the direct connection of the kitchen to team is there useful .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also task of the kitchen - will in future be carried out by a special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it is placed in the cost @-@ comparison between self @-@ reg@@ ression and stranger for the city as the most economical challenge , it is stated from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time workers are to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the education area at all not as strong in the weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

elections can only be really representative and credible if women can participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections to provincial council and presidential elections take place on April 5th .

Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will continue to intensify the democratic success of Afghanistan .
Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women are registered with a total of 3.@@ 6 million voters .

GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make himself a long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow on the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company could weigh about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , besides other products hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea cookies . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; he added that employees and trade union officials would &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the branches of the company , the GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s firm called for concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain a clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of rab@@ ies , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force focus strongly on the local community and the great area of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production down@@ fall , the Eastern end of Glasgow urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has only recently received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will react directly to that , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees , that we are active as all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment , to continually check our businesses - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we are fully aware of the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site , and we should change our operational processes at the location , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave the persecution of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in their pursuit of ne@@ ym@@ ar , after they exp@@ elled an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to exp@@ elled its free@@ wheel @-@ clause , but do they have warned of Barcelona three years before the World War . &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand whereby Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after ending , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is becoming the most expensive player in the world and for the most affordable professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G provides wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way to outside , although a spring in the Catal@@ ans of the Catal@@ ans ins@@ ists that the club always has given its best to take care since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world three years ago warned by the PS@@ G @-@ president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association which sign one of the best players in PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association at the beginning of this summer interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G pointed out that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report un@@ loaded Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report to the dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ence of the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report for the mis@@ usable sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen keeps on discussion .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ nder , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated by the former Regen@@ sburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year brother of the German Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church to serve , when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger might express its deep regret about their own om@@ issions or its then false evaluation of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; did not critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; &quot; two measure &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg no one knows that it would be a sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful action &quot; act which must be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of medi@@ al manipulation &quot; , &quot; thus the author in Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils , is already part of the All@@ an experience , and public opinion is preparing to hold this for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis meant in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; we are happy to go to the church and this is a f@@ aint fres@@ co@@ es .
&quot; moreover , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; blows a very normal pedago@@ gical instrument , &quot; &quot; to be ready with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot;
they are unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades as the world has changed .
&quot; in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often deaf . &quot;
&quot; completely wron@@ gly , says author and historian Michael Hes@@ sia , who recorded with R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s mem@@ ento &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he values the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , with high pl@@ au@@ si@@ bilities &quot; victims of attacks , 67 dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , the dom@@ ell@@ meister has been used in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students were also v@@ ague . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other alleg@@ ations , many victims were underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even having positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report of the sc@@ aff@@ ary sc@@ andal expressed in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents &quot; of violence perpetr@@ ated by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting image of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand many students raise his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as chol@@ in@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist who was pal@@ p@@ able of the furn@@ ace once a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not brought any top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ sia : if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to wonder why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of medi@@ a@@ - or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school occurred outside of its scope .
you can pre@@ tend to be late of it too late or do not take the first hint seriously enough .
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school in which he worked , was perceived by practically all respon@@ dents as - so literally - &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes an excellent witness , describes him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who provided the guys regularly with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ sa@@ ons , and &quot; always en@@ camp@@ ed by the grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tionist and his high emotion@@ ality , who also led to wound erup@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; that he threw not only with chairs and cast the key@@ word on the ground , but also ear@@ co@@ vert guys in hair or ears , he has given himself a lot of years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to his honor &apos;s salvation , however , must be said that such educ@@ ative methods were widely spread in the fra@@ il period , the 1960s and 1970s , common in parents like with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre @-@ school , there are certainly Bagh@@ dad . &quot;
&quot; if you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ tan@@ ces and role as the brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , so many media have straight to him . &quot;
&quot; the Bav@@ arian pop@@ e are working many , who never understood him , nor ever di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
the truth is : the report app@@ alled Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in connection with the report , we report a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also include any contrac@@ tion or co @-@ ordin@@ ance with regard to sexual abuse of the load ? &quot;
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
&quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar with the cap@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a du@@ el substitute for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing . &quot;
the real problem in dealing with sexual abuse has been and yet is that most of the victims were silent .
&quot; if they were not even familiar with parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in relation to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a frag@@ mentary student formed so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he could have occurred ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) timely knowledge and would have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that just for him ... Bu@@ ben ein@@ pus@@ hy or clearer , or more clearly opened , than in relation to their parents , inter@@ nat@@ s , trust tut@@ ors etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report leads to the very clear outcome : &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free of charge from every fellow @-@ knowledge . &quot;
&quot; thus , it may not be thrown before , not prevented or brought it to display . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as unfortunately it was in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was much of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; to read in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is sent out in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ sia : this is the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a giant milking of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is , in turn , is a abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it becomes clean separated : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say to other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report had been dealt from time since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which l@@ ad of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were ski@@ pped and mal@@ ated , and among them dis@@ gr@@ itt@@ led , un@@ event@@ ed all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to be found . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had nothing to do with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on that was how the most witnesses stress , the subject of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; one was only happy to escape , and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states . &quot;
what was different on the domain in the domain ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ sia : there was already discipline , but is no sa@@ di@@ st violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concluded that &quot; many victims are estim@@ ating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even having positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; thus , at most still the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away . &quot;
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he didn &apos;t want to hear anything , and then just returned to 1993 . &quot;
cured Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral Gymnasium , which was even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out that , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school continues to be practiced the test . &quot;
&quot; already in the light of the danger of negative press conferences , he recommended urgent inv@@ itations . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted of , when audi@@ t@@ aps had long been banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that time , they were in a legal gray area , like everyone of us still know . &quot;
&quot; it was hard to estimate for him , where those affected may be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the exam@@ iner to schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis affir@@ med , it is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gic standards to the after@@ math of time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; &quot; Fall@@ on of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; , &quot; thus the danger of the past is to be assessed according to the moral principles of today . &quot;
the princess has already quite right .
&quot; of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was vile and not for what was bre@@ wed in the pre @-@ school and violence of innocent Ch@@ il@@ ine , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
&quot; that is all quite aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it is finally going to work . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger must take protection in protection , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means to discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. ear@@ co@@ wardly and to the hairs and ears , were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; if physical punishment then was forbidden , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regen@@ sburger time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
was the topic hoping to be used in the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ sia : well , in the book , it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells of his perspective , as the domains played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I don &apos;t forget that he led a stric@@ ter reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; but that must also be said that without these perfec@@ tionist , without calling for un@@ related discipline , it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world @-@ related Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen an institution of world @-@ tran@@ g , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition which went twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and Bon@@ b@@ ons alone , one does not do a big singer and stand before every success , right in which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ binding . &quot;
what kind of people have you experienced in their book for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ sia : through work in the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and experienced again as a wonderful , hum@@ orous , cosmopolitan , deep believing and sav@@ ory good people , of which one could not imagine , that he could not only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former cathedral sp@@ ying still today , 23 years after its empowerment , keep contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not for@@ given him up to date , that he once was strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are thankful to him today , that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a stric@@ ted father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely irrever@@ ence to which she is still looking for and to worship them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : everything you are considering , are educ@@ ative methods that were then on the agenda . &quot;
we can be glad we have overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , only because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sin . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent , which is behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was published just , disp@@ osed him . &quot;
&quot; now the state @-@ areas , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great services and without whom from Bavaria and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace . &quot;
