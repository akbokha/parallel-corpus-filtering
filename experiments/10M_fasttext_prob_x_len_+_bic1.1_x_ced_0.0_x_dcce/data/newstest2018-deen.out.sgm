<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that make your look at the city</seg>
<seg id="2">Irren Anstalt where young people are going to encounter young people.</seg>
<seg id="3">A greeting chapel, where now is dug for the S-Bahn Tunnel. "</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners provide the one-time reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if land cards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who has had an exciting time, because the car Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a circumnavigation street."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, a offer of Geoportas in Bavaria of the State Government, are anything but current - but therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare it with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Mercury since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you see as such is not equal.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the great supervisor were built for cities and communities with detailed maps, so-called urine sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These emerged according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and jump the first arrest of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army-leader invaded Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second World War Crimean War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave an topographic recording of Bayerns: of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally when the French troops went off with the peace of Lunéville, from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbors, which created the idea of a region-wide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" topographical Bureau "- and thus the Bayerische Verwaltung der Management."</seg>
<seg id="19">The principal positional leaf for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found as any other on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is most impressive on the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is subsendling, which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, in the district of Munich."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses submering are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the West park, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: at the first glance, there is a small copy card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten raids from the so-called" "urine" "which was derived from the basic tax."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers anymore - but small gardenser of the plant "land in sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area stands out north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 swings of the October October, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the premiere leaf, one reads in the territory of the present district Au-Haidhausen not only the street name" "am Gasteig" "or off the hill" "On the air" "- but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, you once found people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner circle-Irrenzy "On the Auer Lünen."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden conducted the institution - that psychiatrist was conducted by King Ludwig's death in connection with the death of King Ludwig."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended for example the chains of so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"moreover, he allowed the staff to apply to violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"first place for 280 patients was first place, later on 500 places was expanded."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there has been the Isar-AMPER-Klinicum Munich-east since 2006, one of Germany's largest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">Now on the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt can now meet young people in Munich's Salesanum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and walked into a youth-house with training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west of the TSV Munich east, east of the TSV Munich east, east of the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was placed in an architectural approach to the origins of the Irrenanstalt, who had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombardment."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" main square, "the Kaufingraße called" Kaufinger alley. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought the Second World War in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 had many holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business buildings and a greeting chapel from the Middle Ages were once standing on the Marienhof, where these days will be the pre-work and take place on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich-card can be compared with the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens of rights published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the promotion of colorful has issued a warning for colored people who travel due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state to Missouri.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, who wants to come into force up to 28 August 2017, invites particular attention to 28 August 2017, as a number of fragmented, down-based allegations in recent times throughout the state and here, it is stated in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently devised Law of Missouri, which makes it more difficult to accuse discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the State, the disproportionality of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have wounds of civil rights, the people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will keep up for their skin color, they are put together or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group formed incidents like racial distortions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under fragile circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline any more during the journey through the State and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of criminals."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the General state Office of Missouri, which is shown that black motorists in the state will keep 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel said."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready if there are cheers or let your relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015 Missouri missed 100 hate crime, according to the latest figures from the hate-breaking report of the FBI, which represents the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the traveler is also an answer to a new Missouri-law which would make it more difficult, a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil liberties Union (ACLU) travel warning for Texas and Arizona, issued by the states of immigration legislation that will contribute to local criminal prosecution authorities to grant people because of the ACLU for further growth propulsion."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but lately, stakeholders have used the measure to be responding to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weiler Project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisbacher Weidefunn project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU-Bundestag Peter White and Kordula Kovac have presented a picture on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the reciter court of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the Fiscal CDU-town met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann gave first insights into his business, in which he served 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young animals, and in five apartments Feriengaeste hosts."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him the alternative marketer trail for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste exclusively serves regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also called BLHV-Chairman of Pisbach, he referred to the Weiler Project as" spontaneous importance. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green space for a lot of work, much must be processed with the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here fighting with the conditions and the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the eleventh operation, and managed this without any chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he does not conduct bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidezvaunt, and is happy about the leader promotion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, the farmers need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"" "we hope that the forestation of the surface could be gone out for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure that we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make up thinking about how they continue their operation," said the Mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers often stand in criticism because of funding</seg>
<seg id="84">Total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which will not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders was funded, a quarter carried the municipality of Pisbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers born 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers pasture."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the durability of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac emphasised:" "you are doing a really good job, without farmers and landings it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">Also for Peter Weiss saw: "the best foods are produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Land of Landscape (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of pastures.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the LPR marked.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the patched surface should not be too npperable (HangEdition over 35 percent) and must be threatened by disarmament."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fisheries pasture in 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots, which would like to build nearly 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the conservation area corresponds 35 hectares, the low-controlled cost of more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump will take the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it if they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other, so carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key-ideologues of the Trump-regime, knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic Axt in a hitous dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller didn't get the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of Boatowners and Liberty-Imiters would have absorbed him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but it resorted to its significance, and in particular the meaning that you have written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"known as Miller Acosta:" "I don't want to go here into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom, enlightened the world."</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is essentially correct, but as it does it itself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the awakened words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" on our monitors was better.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he clearly pointed out that these people are not welcome in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">"this conflict, because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle: it is indeed a conflict with the significance of America."</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and their friends who put themselves on the basis of placing their words after their death on the basis - knew very well that it has accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the feminine embodiment of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she has a very different name for himself: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing wanted to switch it back for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not one, but rather an early neo-conservative that the American flame is going into the surrounding world:" lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch is not intended to enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something to come across.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and certainly a question of point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of men, seek refuge and have a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective of which Miller and Trump will ever recognise.</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch is not meant to enlighten the path, but hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two weakens were included in the UK.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Director of the Unchantthletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member denomination will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 that starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland has developed something special" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it, until we figure it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in Scottish Institute of Sports and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - to compete against Sir Mo Farah at the 5.000 m distance, while Eilidh Gyle was elected by the crew to the team of team."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"your captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were shoottable or where ever they live or train, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh very naturally longed, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of silver medallists that will compete in their fifth world Championships on 400-m-hurdle, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 pians are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="146">"over the past year, Muir lead on this path and has set up five British and two European records in the past year."</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1,500 m runs, is another Scotsman, which is part of a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle recalls her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannerts captain in says that they are" hugely proud "in the fact that many of their countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also in the medals and at the finalists."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing to be dedicated to team captions is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour to know, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and have chosen to make it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise in podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech is concerned as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this home support and benefit from it, that we are again at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: take you not about a public office when you can't wear the incite of voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers suggested it because of all, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He smashed in criticism of criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"for in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid, and mute we are led the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work for more than Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogoose employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 persons and expressed their opinions on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties Union complained about it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the governor left the lawsuit as frifril, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a Republican governor in a overwhelming democratic state, which is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest-highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary way to combine with his voters and to debate his haareless head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum, which is officially designated as officially and by employees who are paid with public tax-Dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan Spreishin Amelia Chasse the acts of the governor and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spaceful people, who vibrate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, a entrepreneurs and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor zipped the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogolic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"Lawymi Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not filled, but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate speech and other current news, she wrote in the commentary section of the message" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same theme, then they are recognized as a so-called collective action rather than a large group of affected people."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governors of the Governors as" concentrated "Spam attack", "other probably would call" intercede. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a reviewer or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in previous time, if one had done the same that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical labels and to burn or protesters protesters and to silence."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is precisely what happens digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise it that he described Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question occurred last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisas County verallest the First Amendment, according to U.S. District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they appointed a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bein (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the moment Washington's time had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous mailbox stroke to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous drills.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who use pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Belizarius "," "Belisarius" and "Portius", "wrote all letters to newspapers, who made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and navigation with Great Britain, overwhelm his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not have her silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the foundation of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The great life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment in a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large home in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed their bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something, that was comparable to my price."</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made an offer on this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square footage was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a spelled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Dining and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose they commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home which was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms covered up, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creative to release the publication.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so that they were overthrown with, without we had to pick up."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to make the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed it Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra-drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic clutch window of Retrovius looks down across the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors play a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends is a short corridor mirrored to make him longer work.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units can accommodate all the stocks and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went into," "says Erfan of the reinforced, furnified MDF-door."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is when you push the door very easily, very easy to guide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an extra bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the base space - or how your property will be valued," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a vestigial form becomes a real estate agent, and a calculation is carried out based on bottom-size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to increase the ground floor and use high quality materials, which give the room its luxury advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and who therefore can help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers acquired 38 real estate valued at more than half a billion dollars, since then the family had bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 to 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - owned by Paul as" main operator and the dominant personality "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's fortune and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">It states that Colin's ownership in the value of €316 million and Paul has valued at the value of $176 million.</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new head of the White House is planning to restrict the flow of information on President Trump - including reports of the news media - hoping to keep the head on a more evenly circuit.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new head of the White House, attending his first working day with guiding staff, he placed a main problem at President Donald Trumps White House which he had repair: poor information that would enter the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefing - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media control."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television ranges from decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of places that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February opposite Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote to the time that" "the key to hold trumps Twitter is under control, according to six former election campaign, to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise."</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps Twitter-habit ever" "was under control" "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this campaign officers must know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets could not contain any more ignition without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">"we will probably never know anything about the tweets, which is not sent to Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff made it a few times to keep away from it, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"however, nobody has consistently prevent it from making trump checks."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a white house, which consist of competing parties, repeatedly trying to further their own agenda by presenting Trump material that could potentially build their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the president of strategic reasons, doubtful information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump how a volcano can react to negative press releases, especially such with shameful leaks and that he will find out where they come."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"it happened at the end of February when anyone was accused of a signature of an article of GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy head office in Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile to be from Lecks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"even though Johnson was banished because of Shicanes, or that he has offered no concrete evidence, or that in the past he has voiced and vowed it in the past."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief Executive Board Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, tried to implement a system to manage and document the trash."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did it work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly seeks three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his adviser still strive for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence services accusing the Kremlin has been specifically mixed in the presidential election in 2016.</seg>

<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men are to be involved in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller also took more and more Trumps in private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Offers Trump personally moved into the center and the accusation will be reproached, whether the president hinders the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand juries is to examine and decide on present evidence in possible proportions, whether the indictment is to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also called the gas chambers.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent of climate change has played a role in the outbreak of the iceberg, according to research is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual interruptions in the region for approximately 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a billing background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>

<seg id="1532">A complete Schelfeis is to be broken down, writes AWI research scientist Daniela Jansen. "</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the more advanced channel has never been withdrawn as far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"moreover, the ice-plate can fall under tension and can fall under a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as they can swim on the water and pushes ice so much water as it follows after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of slingering leads to the glaciers that the glaciers can flow directly into the ocean and much more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the low extent, the British research project writes to the observation of the Antarctic (MIDAS)."</seg>

<seg id="1539">"on the passage from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge for the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although there is a natural act and is not aware of a direct connection to climate change, the kingsign is now into a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly newspaper Riodoce normally meet to check out their plans for the coverage of the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by the organized crime against corruption and unceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It was told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what is safer to feel secure: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with granite or to leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters, name for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and abdominal."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drugs boats, politicians, businessmen, journalists, journalists, who are suspicious to stand on the salary list of the government or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no retirement from the violence, and while in the whole country the corpses accumulate, more and more journalists are at the same time: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Niever participated in December 2012. 589 standing after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there has been at least seven deaths in seven states this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editors and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist, Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large photo by Valdez, which shows its mid-finger with the word" Justice, "hanging his mid-year, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although in 2010 a Sonder-Bundesangler was built, in order to process the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee started to protect journalists only two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, who are associated with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"with Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are untrendent and even though the terrain is now more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting held a little benefit for discussion of security, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the Why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">In the morning of the 15th of May Valdez has left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a couple of blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was halted by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot upon him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Tweld "river." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius went away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to wander freely in Culiacan freely.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country as rival political groups are struggling to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the road, or that the cemetery is full of verted, two-story moutholeans for drug lovers, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of 'peace', if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs business routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), is co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interviews with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the sons, suspected Gangers purchased each copy of the output once they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper which had released the same story to leave the country into its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He has survived so long that his friends and colleagues are saying that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined forces with five colleagues in the formation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism, without banning the noise issue," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"in time, the newspaper served a reputation because of the courageous and honest reporting, and the turnover and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to publish tough meetings without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could handle."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the foundation of Riodoce she received the prestigious" "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in the pursuit of the Mexican drug history, wherever it goes."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily to that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living", "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in October. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">"you have to take the task of falling as a journalist, either that or you play the dumb."</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in the face of so many things... why did you not say what was going on?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the spawning-bird, who was like a harbour-bird, the friend, the generous with hugs and ratings, a teacher that knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always bear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, go and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now she is asking: was his love for the routine, his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also has forced them to question their own assumptions on the question of how they can best do their work, and remain alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it if you are dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homestarting and cross-paths, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-keeping."</seg>
<seg id="1865">To trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it is wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" "smell become a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens."</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the ancient rules, as he and others say, apply in Sinaloa no more - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for security training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before has been announced that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-storey building of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, which the Governor itself was not trusted."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are really under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the output of this week Riodoce has opened on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">It gave the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an Exposé to the government spending that focused on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was one group, which resulted in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter took from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy, who ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri-governors were accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman departed a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months before the readers had viewed the Kolumba of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "" El FLACO "because of its slim physique."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was devoted to storage space for signs and stickers to protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporter's Miriam Ramirez snaps up a few characters, and went the next morning to a demonstration for a further journalist to the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing, that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">All over the country journalists have become soundly stronger by organising them in organized protests "SOS Press" on obedience and constructions.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to pick up journalists and bring them to the truth, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has asked since then that she is grouped again by the government, because it is concerned that their anger has violated its objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, involved in government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism "he wrote that reporter will not only be killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"the media" "Articulo 19" "has reported more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you give because they want you to keep the mouth shut up," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">"nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias, in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found together with a note, which supposedly was signed by the Zetas box:" "I am here because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer sheet and headphones next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte, in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslav Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others go on as there did El Manana from Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly directed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have flown out of their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find jobs in exile, and they still watch the roads and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they will be hunted, as it was apparently murdered with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered by four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay back and continue working, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, indicates that the drug trafficking is scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico is going to hell, and that is why I was reporter."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drink beer, as at once all their phones began to summoned."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of showeries with Bandenriching and security forces near the bathortes Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war has continued to escalate as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board cutting edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce about cell phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heults near - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the policeman the guards held to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid of all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose Middle-finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed its footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day when Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send it to the road to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used flage to differ from its enemies.</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue even though a frightening.</seg>
<seg id="1924">Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible age of Canadian miners have been so well received that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well preserved that they could even notice that his gimmed skin of reddish that was - and they said, they could have had something from a" "rude past." "</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described it as" the circumcised dinosaurs, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier, who lived in the middle of the chalk time between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved state has researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored Plant tore is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something, which appeared from the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to see more accurately."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) to uncover heavy ground."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're just a little blind with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter into the science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this vegetable-eaters, although it is covered with a armor and a changing tank, probably served by meat and send dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage, in order to hide from predators, and used an sealing technology that is used as a counter-cremation that is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better into its surroundings and to deviate its enemies, say to what suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosauer has been headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is Borealopelta marking Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing maintenance of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the patterns and form of scales and armaments over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-gradations, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-teeth is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta is far beyond that of the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted from enough pressure by meat, the dinosaurs was hunted that the evolution favored the wear of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of contemporary animals that use counter-gradations - think of deer, zebras or gages - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real struggle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong carnivory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators must have been the chalk time," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins shows also that the skin of the dinosaurs rotbrown was.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on indications of his life, including its preserved display, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sunk on the back to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta had become so warm as South-rivers today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with a contaminated skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal is almost like the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much fantasy to reconstruct it. if you only play a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, as huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaur, who stood on two legs to go through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus rex, millions of years lived after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furtive ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthigrus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and is mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum it is the terraced dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is completely from the muzzle up to the hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1.300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long tops, that rained from his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored Plant Breeater has been damaged by the western Canada, until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater cremation of the dinosaurs kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy paneling along the dinosaurs</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it will be."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified reste of the skin still cover the bumpy tank-plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his former head-foot is located on his side, his five fingers are tightened up."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, the one sitting in St. Louis on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that rented it and scrolled by Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled across a post of someone from the high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else had posted on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ Theepharoah was constantly saving on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, a unarmed black 18 year-old who was killed by a white policemen in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of browns's naked body, which was stretched on the road and stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," "Ferrell thought."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone in order to return later in the evening to Tweet over people on the Canfield drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who affirms to his master's father, who carried a shield with the wording:" Ferguson Police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live feed in which a policeman was faced with a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, a different policeman said his gun and cried:" I will kill you... animals all killing. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," "recalled Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2035">That is not the kind of murder that we have used to us and which we can say typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">In that moment I felt Schütz.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6 year old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened during the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film" "Whose Streets?" "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a history of survival and Protestes, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and have filled the streets to challenge the answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown, according to Ferguson, the two are talking, that they had countless occasions in this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, as I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You need to know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience, in which she personally experienced no eklatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep them far away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop, when they arrived in Ferguson, located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a campground, considered the activists to the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There are Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and halves to pass them on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after the 9th of August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"" "I had no experience in organizing."</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to the meaning of Ferrell:" "do you want to document it, or tries to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"these scepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by white men in a community who benefited from their pain and their resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan explained recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson, whose voices were not centered and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area that is known for his activism by Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought us closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of" "Whose Streets?" "in the years to Brooklyn."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we speak," "said Davis."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for this is how I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is at the movement" "not to get a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open place in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the Menshevik of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrer's story repeated the role of the black gay women in the wider Black-lives-Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "by Martin in 2012, identify the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, and therefore we are constantly struggling on various fronts. "</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement is really kept by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it exists, however, that" this is not a affirmist type of action, chosen in the heap due to its identity as the heart of film. "</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person that stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no coincidence although it was on the front line, because with a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman stands as much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel her energy by the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long ago disappeared, but the racist connections between the municipality and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway on a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which they call their homes:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she cled up with a song and she feels obliged to her mind, since she went into Ferguson the road three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "sizes: TV-readers are discussing about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit-gallery moves the people although it is not built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-edge of the pedestrian zone divides since the first presentation 2009, the people in advocates and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the issue can hardly be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Folklore and Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"to say one to the bit-gallery," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "" does not need a man "" (Siggi Betts) or quite plain: "" scale Wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates are building that a gallery draws more customers to the city, the other stores will benefit, fear the opponents that then the pedestrian precinct."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market stands, in which 13 direct market commercials."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the start of construction work will be the conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - and indeed, for Beda-square, with possibility to sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landings always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is an opportunity to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">There is also the same in other cities.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"above all, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether direct market commercials in a market hall in the gallery, comes to the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"however, the situation is likely to be very low in the new project."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why Shopping Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"if clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">Of this there are enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shop stores are left empty - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least keeping us at least the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly from the producer and is well-priced."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, Ladin stores will be rented in a shopping center only by larger companies, because the dorsal rents are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops there is almost no more and what still exists, will probably even disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a Markthalle fits not together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market hall during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it create the ghost bit-gallery already, to sell all the shops of Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a Shopping Center, which stands empty, does not need anyone."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to support a real farm market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmers market hall, it is thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg does not place any more."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost incomparably identical - that hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the earlier secrecy a 35-year prison sentence, after it made public as a secret, diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, A Becoming resemblance (A suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was united to their expertise in technology, computer sciences and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking thesis, whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithms analysis of DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as if someone with these genomic data might look like someone with these genomic data - the many ways how they can be interpreted, and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been spoken openly about the identification as a woman since its puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 accusations, including six breaches of the spider law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"the prison was suppressed their image, so much that there was only one single photo - a granular, black-white selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting at a riding seat and a platoblonde is associated with it."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg was just coming from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist portrait of strangers made from forensic artefacts like cigarette lighter and chewing gum, by extract the DNA out of the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they brought an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press release of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse were sent to an unequal brilliance, which has been several letters exchanged during the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comics' suppressed Images, who would like to convert a future in which the Chelonia's decision would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning release after seven brutal years would demand in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy encounter."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat lowland, and starkes, since Donald Trump performs a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender-troops to find new, tweetive paths that he should actually fix, further on."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey-Hagborg, after the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen to happen for a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a wall written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for creing with their oversized signature among them (the" "i" "in their family name is provided with a heart) an end of the automatic fragmentation, whose basis, gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandfüßler of Cs and Gs and As in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), like amazingly similar, at least in organic ways, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so these are 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room is a page from the above comic novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how they replunge with a free-hand elefon in the hand from the disciplinsightseeings of the United States such as King-Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they dictate your speech, then they have won", "says it."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the Comicbook, but when they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacren, who together like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, as everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), in which their genetic data groups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had it on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowds" said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which tasted even behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote 2014's Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected emotional."</seg>

<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle, and talked with land-flection, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked in the illustrations of his book."</seg>

<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazy in 2017 there will be a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots.</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, in fact."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots during the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, embossed professor for Robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must start to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of nipple, and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves fun over them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robot with a silicon skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adapt to his robot according to his convictions, and select everything from the eye colour of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there will be more disturbing, as many robots have the" "personalities", "which would be a Stepford woman progression."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpughts have developed to robots with a silicon skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt its robots to the properties which they find appealing to, such as shampness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the unwritten roxxxy gold sex robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah" who gives the impression of relapsing and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," warmed the website of True companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>

<seg id="2405">"it may be tired of being fixed on conversation, or it can be" in the mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many troubled aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underscores on rape, when you take a step to Frigid (i.e. here: contradicting) Farrah, beekey a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True is True Roxxxy with a vibration, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men then not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, this sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex play."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and its increasing sophistication in a little darker and deeper understanding in our culture to retreat from the ideal equality of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition to sex.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robots, and while the FRR realises their growing popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of Consumer Culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what permeates from the edge zones, can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until they give their permission to them.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain remnants that these highly developed sex robots occur in a time when the rights of women are threatened in the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has getailed to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">The abominous aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical images that discarded bodies and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but in the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar-proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their peers want them to feel human as they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, on the point, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You cannot separate yourself from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or a background story, nothing, which could hinge on independence or anything, which could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone knows which she knows, including the Republican kinship, with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite especial on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"around the dining table, this is certainly a good thing, but it falls with me in another context that this will also bring considerable risks."</seg>

<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammation, bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Rotate meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system such as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, affecting some 1,3 million and in the United States 300,000, causes gastric fights and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually getting rid of meat and milk products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins can help to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestinal patrol to make sure that harmful microbes that hide themselves in the food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells, which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance goes too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, experiments has been found that a kind of tolerance with mice is found in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their initiates."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich food tolerant, less inflamed intestinal lieus encourages, if the same system also wires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral researcher in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immunisation that encourages the tolerance as it emerged that a group of study rews had such cells, but a different group of this tribe, which had not been separated, but that did not have."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the noblems of the mice were set in DNA sequentially and there were six bacterial species found in the mice with the immune cells, but without them were lacking in the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were a intestinal microbiome, and they did not develop these kinds of immunograms, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria carried out onto the immune system, the researchers of L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then overthrew small amounts of liquid, without the bacteria - on unripe immunicells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan-Metabolism that is known as Indol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophanvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us are reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products made of L. reuteri found the cells in people like with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cells take inflammation on the internal surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">"potentially, high tryptophanvalues can lead to the presence of L. reuteri at an extension of these population."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report unloaded Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report to the discontentence of the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report for the misusable scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen keeps on discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated by the former Regensburger bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year brother of the German Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church to serve, when Müller and Ratzinger might express its deep regret about their own omissions or its then false evaluation of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano" "did not criticized that in the coverage of violence at the Domspatzen with" "two measure". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg no one knows that it would be a shameful and shameful action" act which must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of medial manipulation", "thus the author in Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit to call the Catholic Church as a source of all evils, is already part of the Allan experience, and public opinion is preparing to hold this for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis meant in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk: "we are happy to go to the church and this is a faint frescoes.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"moreover, she pointed out that in her youth" blows a very normal pedagogical instrument, "" to be ready with naughty children, as I was one. "</seg>
<seg id="2899">They are unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger was often deaf."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrongly, says author and historian Michael Hessia, who recorded with Ratzinger's memento" "My brother of Pope" "(translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he values the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese of Regensburg with the clarification of attorney Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, with high plausibilities" victims of attacks, 67 domspatzen sexually abused. "</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, the domellmeister has been used in many cases of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students were also vague."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other allegations, many victims were underestimated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even having positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report of the scaffary scandal expressed in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" incidents "of violence perpetrated by the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a conflicting image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand many students raise his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as cholinker and perfectionist who was palpable of the furnace once a Domspatz has not brought any top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hessia: if you make the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of media- or co-knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the violence of violence at the pre-school occurred outside of its scope.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can pretend to be late of it too late or do not take the first hint seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school in which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally -" "salvation", "" "Heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"also the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes an excellent witness, describes him as" warm, "" sincere, "" sincere "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher, who provided the guys regularly with cakes, biscuits and bonsaons, and" always encamped by the grapes of children. "</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionist and his high emotionality, who also led to wound eruptions."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he threw not only with chairs and cast the keyword on the ground, but also earcovert guys in hair or ears, he has given himself a lot of years ago, deeply regrets and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to his honor's salvation, however, must be said that such educative methods were widely spread in the frail period, the 1960s and 1970s, common in parents like with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a world school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pre-school, there are certainly Baghdad."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if you ask yourself whether it is not more likely to do with his acquaintances and role as the brother of Benedict XVI, so many media have straight to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"the Bavarian pope are working many, who never understood him, nor ever diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report appalled Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, we report a lot about the issue of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"will Georg Ratzinger in the final report also include any contraction or co-ordinance with regard to sexual abuse of the load?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"no one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have become familiar with the capellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to speak with my father or my mother about it," "said a duel substitute for the others," It was all very embarrassing. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in dealing with sexual abuse has been and yet is that most of the victims were silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even familiar with parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen Ratzinger's role in relation to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a fragmentary student formed so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he could have occurred (Georg Ratzinger) timely knowledge and would have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that just for him... Buben einpushy or clearer, or more clearly opened, than in relation to their parents, internats, trust tutors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report leads to the very clear outcome:" "that the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is free of charge from every fellow-knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, it may not be thrown before, not prevented or brought it to display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to associate its good name with these contradictory crimes, as unfortunately it was in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was much of" "violence" "to read in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is sent out in the report. "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hessia: this is the great problem that in the reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a giant milking of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is, in turn, is a abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it becomes clean separated: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well as we say to other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report had been dealt from time since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which lad of sadist teachers were skipped and malated, and among them disgrittled, unevented all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to be found."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had nothing to do with the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, for he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domspatzenging school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was how the most witnesses stress, the subject of" pre-school "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">"one was only happy to escape, and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even" heavenly "states."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the domain in the domain?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hessia: there was already discipline, but is no sadist violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concluded that" many victims are estimating the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even having positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at most still the accusation remains to have looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was not responsible for the events at a school where he didn't want to hear anything, and then just returned to 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Cured Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral Gymnasium, which was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out that," "that in the pre-school continues to be practiced the test."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in the light of the danger of negative press conferences, he recommended urgent invitations."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity consisted of, when auditaps had long been banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that time, they were in a legal gray area, like everyone of us still know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was hard to estimate for him, where those affected may be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examiner to schools were officially abolished in Bavaria too.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis affirmed, it is unfair to apply today's pedagogic standards to the aftermath of time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "Fallon of Anachronism", "thus the danger of the past is to be assessed according to the moral principles of today."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has already quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was vile and not for what was brewed in the pre-school and violence of innocent Chiline, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that is all quite awful, and I am glad that it is finally going to work."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, Georg Ratzinger must take protection in protection, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means to disciplining and punishment, i.e. earcowardly and to the hairs and ears, were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"if physical punishment then was forbidden, he has also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the topic hoping to be used in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hessia: well, in the book, it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells of his perspective, as the domains played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I don't forget that he led a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but that must also be said that without these perfectionist, without calling for unrelated discipline, it would probably hardly be possible to form an institution of world-related Regensburger Domspatzen an institution of world-trang, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition which went twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and Bonbons alone, one does not do a big singer and stand before every success, right in which area, but always discipline, passion and self-binding."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people have you experienced in their book for Georg Ratzinger?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hessia: through work in the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced again as a wonderful, humorous, cosmopolitan, deep believing and savory good people, of which one could not imagine, that he could not only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former cathedral spying still today, 23 years after its empowerment, keep contact with him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him up to date, that he once was strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most Domspatzen are thankful to him today, that he has enriched her life and brought to them the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a stricted father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely irreverence to which she is still looking for and to worship them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: everything you are considering, are educative methods that were then on the agenda."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, only because he is prominent and has an even prominent brother to make a medial sin."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent, which is behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was published just, disposed him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the state-areas, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and without whom from Bavaria and maybe Germany no one would probably know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
