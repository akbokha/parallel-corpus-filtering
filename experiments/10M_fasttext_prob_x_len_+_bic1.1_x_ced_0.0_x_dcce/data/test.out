Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this made the Hollywood star in an interview now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I always put in drawers or get caught by the outside label , who usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly speaking , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh it to be as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as it explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine . &quot;
&quot; most importantly the act@@ ress spends her time at home , on TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and mex@@ ican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the white @-@ gl@@ ut it takes the question of the child &apos;s wish : &quot; &quot; we women must not be married or children have to be perfect &quot; &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; mother &apos;s Day - Love Is Not Child &apos;s Play &quot; is An@@ iston to see a single mother of two sons .
the film works with us from the 25th of August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide
his experiences on the horse are visible .
at the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled to their end of the evening , they said in quick g@@ allo@@ p to the home . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and that ended the riding career as well as again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament si@@ ege - again close to horses .
he allowed to lead himself with his family over the plant of the AL@@ RV on a horse he didn &apos;t take time for photo purposes .
this was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German Spor@@ thilfe re@@ vo@@ iced the man from An@@ hausen within the framework of a small Gala the Golden Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
it lacks the sympathetic athle@@ te .
&quot; federal Sup@@ port@@ ant , silver Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen had already packed him .
long is the 18th Award of the Sport@@ pyram@@ ide .
&quot; at Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; for it is not only awarded for sporty successes but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros as much as possible . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the double @-@ mast winner was recorded on Saturday in the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the out@@ put@@ ted Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner E@@ ber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the son Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Spring@@ j@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these athletes came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part the illustr@@ ative society moved into the Spring@@ stage where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger lasted away to the big animals .
Clin@@ ique and Tr@@ umps economic policies compared with : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP - they want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential elections are however in control and energy policies as well as in a fundamental problem . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the feeling rather small in doubt and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely increase regulations , and he makes for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the contrary , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has to open disadvantage and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , say Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ e . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical team of Bonaparte .
so on Tr@@ ump you could find some party discussion .
more visible are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and rebuild coal mining in the USA .
oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton is aiming to expand and asks the renewable energies with its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want that we are . &quot;
&quot; however , not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ ka trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to isolate the USA from international trade , but just better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , and calls for about Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage from 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump does to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be , then he says he should not be changed . &quot;
but the large discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics stop him , so the bud@@ get@@ ary deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich that they will pay more taxes and their critics say , more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
flight : &quot; every frozen woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who alone escape , almost already for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four wives .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her small son in his arms .
he looks curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother star@@ es on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier of social relief services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are frozen .
they live in Munich north in one of the few de@@ centralized accommodation for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid relief .
&quot; recently , it has been officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ation to say : any woman who arrives here has made her flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically secuted , because they threaten to threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women there are several reasons for escape , &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run that goes on .
&quot; for example for a bottle of water calling for a bottle of water is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
and the women are alone ; they are not protected by their families .
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells . &quot;
&quot; even here , all women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to some 90 percent of women living in Munich in the north of Munich , traumati@@ zed them . &quot;
some of the children are certainly not voluntary .
many women are so habit@@ ual that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t trust openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not cure yourself , it will need more accommodations only for them . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven districts of the district are responsible for keeping refugees . &quot;
&quot; whether or not she knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , please answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there are some kind of accommodation for governments not . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women alone are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Lower and mid @-@ fran@@ ken are there in some common shel@@ ters or own houses just for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study that was published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women and women are missing , it may come to - continuous violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this guardian , one can read at the cr@@ ush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has been talking about that there is us , we have a long queu@@ es , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily make a second house .
assistance defen@@ ders : demands for new work amp@@ eding measures
proxy for the assistance of the resident companies have called for their union to be new work amp@@ on with their disputes concerning a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire advice from beginning September more work amp@@ on measures .
&quot; the J@@ DC said that there was a Minister of Ministers , to respond to the concerns regarding the contract . &quot;
&quot; assistance and medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract in July about the rejection of a contract , which was agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Thursday night on Twitter , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , said the government &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently quiet &quot; to problems that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of that the J@@ DC Board voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and have been asking for official new negotiations for all the people concerned . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today set up a formal application for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to escal@@ ate a sustained program of escal@@ ating work , which begin in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that in the history of the N@@ HS , assistance in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Ass@@ ist Dr. Johann Mal@@ a@@ ana joined the election of the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that took place even before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistants and medical students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t , said that the contract for physicians would be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of external lateral &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight months long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterpart at the g@@ ild@@ ed Hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s Palace in reception , I cannot rep@@ el the expression of Ankara that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the manual , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin has worked in sm@@ iles , and he took a little bit of heat , even for his long @-@ lasting relationships . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report entire five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in advance of the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan had heard that Erdo@@ gan as would never happen any worst .
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that Russia &apos;s head was not forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory session : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ated burned .
Putin claimed and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back .
&quot; the failure was even bigger , as it was committed by a friend friend . &quot;
c@@ rau@@ ds re @-@ establish again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; months long , the nation@@ alised media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most of the most serious officials were the accus@@ ations of leaders in Syria , that Erdo@@ gan had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic state . &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was , that it is time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ologies that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara the advantages of a ceas@@ e@@ fire clearly lie on the hand .
Erdo@@ gan requires first and foremost to all the friends who he can get after spending last month at a failed state .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially ban charter flights , which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the public reviews are cheap , fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ ams are once again allowed to be re @-@ imported . &quot;
&quot; a report in ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ alities it : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry with the West , since it has been a response to the tried power over power . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the continued Gro@@ ll over the Schne@@ eb@@ emp@@ o of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ping is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for the attempted coup d &quot; I called for support for the elected government bodies . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ evident for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a profound fear of reg@@ iment . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , as a analy@@ st once described , &quot; &quot; Alliance of external lateral &quot; &quot; : two countries , who are committed themselves from the West and are badly affected . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradic@@ tory pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions , both president spoke at the press conference , that they did not even trace the subject . &quot;
the President of Turkey deliberately refused to respond to a question of its differences while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise this .
&quot; it is not a clear consensus on it , where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria . &quot;
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for perfect Dis@@ aster , when NATO member Turkey joins the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to one another . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for Scotland outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand should be reduced to a back@@ Office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS were linked to the global ambitions of the Bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since eight years ago almost collap@@ sing and saved .
&quot; at this time , br@@ anded &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer co @-@ financing marks . &quot;
it supported the international sport with millions Po@@ unds of sponsor@@ ing from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business , which will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of our customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand , among which our employees will be employed , as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS has become a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities , and our employees will work among these brands with the customers . &quot;
R@@ BS has already said that the Six Nations sponsorship will no longer be continued and that it will increase the perception of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , for how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal for three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can sound these marks again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori achieved his 3,@@ 000@@ ten win at New@@ market in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sp@@ illed Champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ten profit &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori took on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , who is trained by John Gos@@ hen , on his local rac@@ etr@@ ack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches a milestone in the low@@ race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ let , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who was previously on G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I &apos;m very happy that it &apos;s happening at New@@ market because I was here 30 years ago .
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ aler Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the itch , when he fet@@ ches the victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction &quot;
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a break @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester pig@@ let , the ninth @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 careers &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone only a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 wins if he was not only a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has suffered a winner in the UK nearly 30 years of winner what &apos;s great .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , what is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat since two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ vor@@ es , including its famous &quot; gl@@ or@@ ative Seven &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash , and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulty in the beginning when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his branches and to return to his form . &quot;
and he has not yet been at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori was once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of life .
Russia Putin pus@@ hes chair Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly his Stab@@ at Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest confidence of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a Special Representative for Environmental and transpor@@ ts .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is stated that Putin agreed without stating reasons &quot; &quot; Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was appointed Doc@@ tor &apos;s proxy since 2012 was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his graduation at the renowned State Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website is called it ( in Russian ) , that he later was a log manager and stru@@ al manager of the government of government . &quot;
&quot; he said to him about his appointment , &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as heads of state and controls to implement your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV Sender on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked this to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest conspir@@ ators Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he is for the sovi@@ et intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , the two men claimed that the staff will return on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power battle ?
this is not currently nobody knows .
&quot; but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president , who once wanted to lead the Russian environmental policy - ran into great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; is true that I have asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - I could almost say - compl@@ ained for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential office for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense . &quot;
&quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council , and as Putin &apos;s former member of the State Security service , K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Safety Service ( FS@@ B ) , who was the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; as Putin got to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people who he most trusted . &quot;
&quot; once was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become the second term President of Russia , as a third term of Putin had rejected against the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , upcoming allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he was elected President after three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he suggested producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical confrontation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced its cancellation in a common opinion . &quot;

Queens@@ las Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by may 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four resolutions of the &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wer &quot; , &quot; which is finishing around each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , and 46 tons of m@@ illing . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by may 2017 .
&quot; in the economic , Keit@@ h Brown appointed a visit to the building site and was one of the first to go from the land to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ cross Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a engineers of a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were alone used for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closing between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the Brü@@ cken@@ deck is a delicate activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is at their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets in Ros@@ y@@ th a Bet@@ ong@@ ation for the Deck , which means the entire Deck is ready to be taken up at the bridge to his place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
in this fantastic project the closure of the tr@@ end@@ setting and deep @-@ structure represents .
&quot; after installing the last road section and its connection with the north tower &apos;s expansion , we had to then close the still existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern in@@ fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , approx . 6,000 tons weighs and at an increase of about 3 % had to be pulled up . &quot;
&quot; un@@ cle , as the toler@@ ances which the team works , are tiny - on each side they bore only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after they were cast off from their fishing boat to Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI li@@ f@@ ebo@@ x hit the Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swim in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around , and set us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used the boat from their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man found at the age of 60 and found at a bo@@ ge@@ on without li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats . &quot;
all of them came to the board of the coast board and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water were lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ wer was in case of a not@@ with@@ al , but this hat@@ s from the person &apos;s c@@ ots from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awakened today about these men .
difficult to hurt - man har@@ p on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the keys to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead cut the non @-@ alcoholic do@@ ers the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he went twice to them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was violated in the hand and in the body .
the police could take the offen@@ se .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming then of his sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm their brother together . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
so she went with her partner out of the house .
on the street they met the ex @-@ habitats of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ friend . &quot;
who is building Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Greens mean : investors should be considered much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschwei@@ g will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
&quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next meeting . &quot;
but argument is programmed .
first and foremost about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; SPD Group president Christoph Vi@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : &quot; &quot; we want to build on urban areas , in the future 20 percent of all apartments should be interpreted as a social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the big dispute in the Town Hall was , however , as viol@@ mann : &quot; how is one going to build up investors , who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 per cent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction programme , which will cost millions of costs and should still be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants to be even hardness for investors .
&quot; regardless of how Brat@@ mann , a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; the concept of action is implemented , will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the experts .
&quot; but the program is not entirely focused , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
but what is the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments in which promotion will run in the coming years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , so the plann@@ ers of Nicole Palm , should now be bought by ongoing bin@@ dings of the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get homes back to the pricing . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
at one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem could solve .
in the west town the end of the year are running .
about 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments there .
only : this does not want the owners to use housing companies .
&quot; after all , the number of social housing in the West city is increasing dras@@ tically , away from the goal of so @-@ called diar@@ rhe@@ a mixture . &quot;
there is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Greens do so that there will be even motion in the discussion .
&quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot;
I have concentrated on more construction places for family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile ? &quot;
it is fascinating to watch how the world is changing .
&quot; that teenagers and child to play do not go outside , but rather , prefer to spend their free time with it , to start screens on screens , has been compl@@ ained in the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; with Pok@@ em@@ on Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; naturally , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters who were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later created a cartoon series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of the pop culture sank into account the interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server over@@ heads .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players are going to go out with their smartphones outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons to be followed by a GPS once they were found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( about a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sprang for the sofa . &quot;
the US introduced the game to a considerable rise in steps that returns the &quot; average &quot; person every day .
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , the 3@@ 5.000 users re@@ pro@@ secuted , the Washington Post recently shared with that within two days of market launch of the game , the number of subsequent people that train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely sees the raw data for performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns for health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; to get active on deaf ears , because many public messages are getting boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be reviewed yet . &quot;
&quot; anyone regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to become suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; thus , three pillars of health covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
&quot; as always there is also a native gam@@ er , which must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is supposed to be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps such as Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be refres@@ hed .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and help many people in hunting are active , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ien
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
stunning on the floor .
on the whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ as at last .
&quot; the 19 @-@ year American gymn@@ ast 60@@ m on Thursday to the multi @-@ day title , and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the head@@ light of the Olympic Games . &quot;
their overall result of 6@@ 2.1 19@@ 8 was clearly defined in front of the Silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; -@@ Mann@@ es@@ sk@@ amer@@ ad@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze sculpture Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American sisters Simone Bil@@ es appeared on the sul@@ p@@ sich@@ ord during the single multi @-@ trial period of women at the Olympic Summer in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin , which wins a multi @-@ trial title and altogether the fifth , while they solidi@@ fies its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
&quot; it burst in tears , when their end result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end . &quot;
this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ bo has dominated its sport art over the last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that the Olympi@@ ad of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton said that she is &quot; &quot; the best turtle you &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected a last test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a last @-@ dimension@@ ed expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; American sisters Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace their children after finishing in gold and silver in the single multi @-@ fight nominal of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal at the Tuesday , while she reti@@ ring at the farewell celebration of the man@@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi as ex@@ cre@@ denti@@ als . &quot;
&quot; although it ins@@ isted on the top , never the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their soil exercises - which contain its typical tumor passport - is tailored to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by Train@@ ers A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flight into the g@@ ymnasium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more multi @-@ party competition , a si@@ pping series that will stop so long as it wants . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina slightly led by two la@@ ths , the image led . &quot;
float beams and bo@@ dent@@ ur@@ ns - in which it holds the World title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she went back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her as she expected her en@@ closure - a pure form@@ ality - and tears on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her collection @-@ book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ capitalism had called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a lead . &quot;
&quot; after its ground exercise , she cast out to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ alls , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appears doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as it concerns , the 19 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old saw a whole new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass murder in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl were shot in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ derer from Phoenix while they were talking in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12 while the car was parked in a single trip , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ fire@@ arm while he stood on the side of the car , and afterwards fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police lied with that the triple murder was not the result of a rob@@ bery of rob@@ bery , since the ass@@ ail@@ ant did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ cher by Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the investigation has led the investig@@ ator , a closer look to it whether it is connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic dormit@@ ories were killed within four months in nine attacks , and two were injured . &quot;
&quot; it takes place in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; distributed Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown n@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities published also a police report on the sli@@ der , which was off on an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the thir@@ sty murder and is assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen , and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the motor room . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and naturally his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of his retirement , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I do not make this .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left upon it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund she will never realize it , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they prescri@@ bes him to be institution@@ alised .
&quot; my first answer to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund may run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was unable to sit down until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but it is making slow progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Ed@@ mund has changed for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a string , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical string -- does it say . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as Mas@@ ers or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly .
&quot; it is still too early to say , how it will affect the life of the viol@@ in@@ avi@@ rus in@@ infected . &quot;
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked , what is going to happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she is still not really white .
&quot; I have no longer asked for the prognosis for a long time , because I do not expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it becomes better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives reason to rescue rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
&quot; fierce rainf@@ alls and large @-@ faced floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana took the governor of the governor , on Friday the emergency . it will be counted throughout the Saturday with more rainf@@ all . &quot;
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the South of the O@@ pp@@ is flooded its banks and threatened with large @-@ faced floods after extreme rainf@@ all , reported the national weather service . &quot;
&quot; governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards , with the public authorities standing in constant contact with the local authorities and have already been travelling to the communities concerned . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ ation of the Govern@@ ors , shared with the requests for high @-@ water trucks , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the community would have requested Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used over wide parts in the South Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
weather permits allowed this area to fall in additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
&quot; in the South of Alab@@ ama , on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ ary was used , while in the area of Mobile there was still ra@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite , near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach over the weekend record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a down@@ ward floo@@ ding flood in Ascension par@@ ish represents a danger , as these above the beaten rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest stand on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still ski@@ pped people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ sters . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , which rose strongly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby is warned .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and exu@@ ded , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years , in which she had never seen such a stronghold of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabled , and he would be the only one that can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer could have saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them into glo@@ omy , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floods began to spread quickly as it was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities are considering evac@@ uation instructions .
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann an observer mel@@ ted close to Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil from the rains had been significantly accomplished since Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities assume that severe rainf@@ alls and street flooded the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a par@@ ish and school failure in five school districts . &quot;
the C@@ BS subsidiaries WW@@ L reported that an ordered in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches which now were both flooded .
&quot; the rulers of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that were fl@@ us@@ hed from the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , not@@ ations were set up to accommodate the evac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water begins to return , they will go back into their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond , the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were provided almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents to feed , who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last great flood that we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses were reported on Thursday as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday we were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; von balls per@@ ched &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified it for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown suffered several shots , including in the lo@@ oming , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital in consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done much , his little body was per@@ v@@ elled from balls , distributed his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I cannot simply believe it .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy divided the channel with that it is expected to recover again .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; likewise , three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front @-@ seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical condition , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the last men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to be a crus@@ fire between several guns .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age sle@@ eves for no@@ m@@ ge@@ we@@ aving , which were pro@@ secuted to various storm @-@ ups , paraly@@ zed the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly about a permanent fight .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the walk , were ro@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active involved , &quot; shared police p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; however , there was no ceremony and the police are currently checking the monitoring video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a tor@@ ch on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of the West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that &apos;s what I imagined at the Tur@@ nen &apos;s Olympic Winter Festival and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie , Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspir@@ es for many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this squ@@ ad , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic in , round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female turtles an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americ@@ an@@ erin .
last year was Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this indicates strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ as and also in America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as she was unexpected , but master@@ ed G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual Americ@@ an@@ erin , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ trial event for Women Gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but we do not look at all classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie suggested all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ans have only four tur@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is so out that Tur@@ nen are becoming more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private trainers who are maintained by parents who pay for the training , furnishings , travel and hotel costs ( for the coach and their tur@@ ers and families ) . the list will continue to continue . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can help business .
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner receive their entire training and that is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both their athletes , since they started with the turbine . &quot;
&quot; we must be inspired to the churches au@@ n countless , young girls , that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , to give an offer and easier to reach trainers . &quot;
I was founded my turn@@ it@@ ement of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable tower in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) , and national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to provide youth high @-@ quality turbines that make the opportunity to learn from this amazing winter sport .
&quot; Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as training and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which brings thousands of young girls to be interested in the tower and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team and thanks , F@@ ass her as many young girls with different backgrounds motivated to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assistance personnel would like to organise more strikes , after they have rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal . &quot;
&quot; the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by adopting a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 assistance employed by a vote , refused . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t plans un@@ veiled plans to introduce the contract , and said that N@@ HS rec@@ alled in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance personnel should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly work , in order to improve the care time . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ ter for Ass@@ ist concerned last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; assistance personnel concerning the proposed contract remains serious concerns , in particular that there is the current workforce crisis and will be administered to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; at only eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts on the part of BM@@ A to resolve disputes by talks must take part in the government for resistance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to a promise , which Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made the last month about it , that his door would always be . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t must act now that is up@@ lifting up and address the worries of assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , so the assistance had made it clear that they are ready to carry further work amp@@ on measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since Nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to grant doctors on the strike post@@ p@@ ette coverage . &quot;
the Ministers had hoped to be able to stop the dispute over changes made by the adoption of the re@@ formed agreement with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to be a better balance sheet for the 5@@ 4.000 people who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employee , called for the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work amp@@ on measures nothing of only little , bel@@ low but already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing care and their families just worry , need and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken of the assistance of assistants and answered with the Ministry of Health as well as other ministries in terms of concerns regarding the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as the posting , flexibility for those who return from a vocational training period , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training courses and the Ministry of Health concerning the compliance with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ to @-@ day medicine can reduce the heart attack
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medicine after recommended by the authorities to admin@@ ister this more people for a longer period of time .
the ger@@ ent medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart ar@@ ctic for people with a heart disease .
the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack while reducing the risk of stroke if or another heart attack is reduced .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a period of four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regul@@ ator N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for a period of four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of it suffer from another heart attack , or stroke . &quot;
heart ar@@ ctic and stroke are caused by accum@@ ulations fatty material in the arteries of the arteries .
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag breaks apart , it may cause a blood cl@@ ots , which causes blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots is sol@@ ves , it may flow through the blood stream and conce@@ aling the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ a@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood @-@ ri@@ gs inevitably . &quot;
&quot; the construction &apos;s throw from N@@ ICE , which today was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack , or stroke . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable adverse effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing other heart ar@@ ctic and stroke cases among people who already had a heart attack .
through a provisional recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to extend the options available to thousands of people who benefit from this .
information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the management design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
the culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ ycle is blo@@ om in Muslim regions .
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report due to corruption from the office . &quot;
a culture of the Political Cor@@ rec@@ ycle has led to that widespread voting in Muslim churches will be ignored and exposed as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les sail@@ ed the police , Elec@@ tions and Rath@@ ites to have ignored evidence of voting abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who is now a face @-@ corrupt , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so badly that the police should be permitted to set off @-@ lock@@ ers outside of electoral cabin to protect sm@@ iled voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should conduct a ID to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must merely call its name and ad@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the report suggests , not to fill out the finger of a person when they leave their vote , in order to prevent someone twice . &quot;
wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection than Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community rules and decisions of non @-@ official commerci@@ als or working groups .
&quot; it is not only for electoral laws but is also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and finance culture , which is associated with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ tro in the east of London .
&quot; last year decided a special court that the acting Mayor Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man , after a L@@ itan@@ ei , to corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ secuted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in the Cypri@@ ot fashion &quot; &quot; and that he would have expressed his critics with rac@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man shall have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ic duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 votes were either doubt@@ ful or the result of a im@@ itation , in which one person is chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there were no proof of fraud throughout the country .
he was particularly alar@@ ming in favour of frau@@ dul@@ ent correspondence - for older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; proving that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , in particular women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ or . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such a behavior could not be ignored on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity regarding eth@@ ni@@ otic and religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activ@@ ist groups can be processed , in order to &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , calls for tougher registration tests to prevent that the electoral directory leads to im@@ migrant and welfare purposes . &quot;
to consider voters before choosing to ask your ID .
&quot; not remot@@ ely using ink at the finger of a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone to choose twice . &quot;
systematic review about the nationality of a person to make sure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on requests to an automatic letter .
ban that political activ@@ ist cover lists and charges of mail selections .
police have the authority to set up shelves .
&quot; a legal change , which makes an indictment due to intimi@@ dation in accordance with the representation of the People Act 1983 ( census Act in 1983 ) . &quot;
photography offered in electoral stations .
&quot; requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) . &quot;
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the staff will rule enforce that voters alone go into the cabin cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets does not show a pen@@ alties .
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy on account of a L@@ itan@@ ei and illi@@ cit practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was guilty on the basis of a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critici@@ zed the in@@ effective &quot; Canc@@ ell@@ ings &quot; of the Elec@@ tions of the Town H@@ alls .
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the Court of Jud@@ gment in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country carries as the mother of the parliaments a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral laws and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double Asia and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ators in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio have passed this week about the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except border and band who turned out to be impressive double @-@ predec@@ essors in the Her@@ zo@@ gin from Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympic Olympi@@ kin is by far not the only one that displays gold milit@@ ant Ath@@ let , who has its own famous double @-@ cros@@ ser - at least not , if you give faith to the social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all of the famous faces , who fli@@ ck@@ led at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ ans that have more than just a certain similarity with hol@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared to Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates Double Asia , many people were transferred on the Internet to how a certain ar@@ cher of the Twin von A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has created a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity of the social media and gave it to hear that he has been hearing from his childhood to hear that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big similarity , except the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I am argu@@ ing the well as compliments . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly step into the center : the open similarity between the British breadth Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ ning Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is expected to go through to the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
a course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut who has similar heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ all@@ ists in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ bath@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , during the American Nathan Adrian von fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that other similarities were also noticed
theory is put into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple .
&quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in stated their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons composed by Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their sm@@ iles , which is almost identical to that of the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has its own beautiful , wide smile , which resembles that by Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone was turned off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ swi@@ vel rel@@ ay his own opinions . &quot;

the criticism of B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard to speak with him many
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ tive B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you would like to present the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been aired about a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen wording , we are sorry that it is happening . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ated at the end of more than 90 times in people , who have responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter . &quot;
the comment@@ ator &apos;s colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copies and put his ap@@ ology at over 90 other Twitter users , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network exc@@ els also fast and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was possible that it will be aired . &quot;
yesterday night we quickly apologi@@ zed during our audience at the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to get one clear , B@@ yron &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a miserable formulation . B@@ yron does what he said , are very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention , that it is not designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment that I have made for the commentary in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ ad , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have attached myself to the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged about women who under@@ wear in the middle of business under@@ wear under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman pulled off her clothes in the midst of a mark to try shelter . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered , as she looked out in it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she rep@@ lied and tasted four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone in which the woman tasted the under@@ pants before they put it back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson who had tried at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had under@@ wear under@@ garments , &quot; she went up again and left the store , without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the table , moved their own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she was just there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; each star@@ red , when she went out the under@@ pants , which you obviously did not please , since they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the same with three further under@@ pants , before they finally decided that you didn &apos;t change anything again and went off . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or about the person who would buy the pants under circumstances they had tried .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how vile to think that someone had an@@ pants with home , that had an other person and have not been washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have been given , the employees tried to draw the garments off the sale after she left - what &apos;s just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and figure out that another woman had she had and went out and they were not washed .
&quot; one speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that occurred on Tuesday , August 9 in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were drawn from sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a before arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ a Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to handle armed rob@@ bers near distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how you turn off for your predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; if you turn out from behind you , then you should turn off as a first one , so that you can see your att@@ acker and get off of the line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bows .
&quot; then hit him with the knee into the gro@@ in and rot@@ ate you , while the att@@ acker sli@@ pped up against pain , the weapon from his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; on att@@ ackers , approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the skin line , grab the weapon and rot@@ ate them so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then rot@@ ate the gun out of his handle before they move back and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi Vor@@ um .
&quot; but remember that it is at a rob@@ bery at the safest , your money is too excessive - unless you are a Kra@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel Ian Wright wa@@ t for a guide to his tongue on the fil@@ est places of Europe
a bri@@ tish trav@@ eller under@@ went his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x in a serious examination - by providing some of the dirty and ec@@ lip@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and Trav@@ eller Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ out@@ te his wake up on a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a flush on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a flush kno@@ b , and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before dra@@ ining each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the r@@ ins@@ ular bones from a train@@ toi@@ lette , who has already been used by thousands of others , may be totally rep@@ ul@@ sive but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately left behind , nothing left what he no@@ d@@ ded , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of its intest@@ ine by traveled through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to sin@@ ks up to dish@@ washing of toilets , the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film , he told me : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he did justice to his call .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its test@@ ament showed a L@@ umin@@ om@@ dom@@ eter of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ om@@ dom@@ eter is freshly made of fresh hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to le@@ ash off after their L@@ umin@@ om@@ dom@@ eter over 4000 units were , while fresh @-@ ru@@ ed hands were one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing that I have shot in a toilet , close . &quot;
there is nothing s@@ mut@@ ated than that !
I &apos;ll do nothing here because it is in@@ elastic here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation .
&quot; the company marked Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we brought crazy Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , who ended with it that we said &quot; &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
claiming that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of just talking about products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary that we could provide the consumers with more information in an interesting way .
&quot; I also think that the film shows , that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot;
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who introduced the direction of the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me tell me so - I wouldn &apos;t have lost my respect for Ian , if he had taken some of the things I have instruc@@ ted to him , like the ec@@ clesi@@ astic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , with which it was easier to bring them to so@@ cks and others , in which this was rather difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film .
&quot; in one of the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents have been associated with the well being of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products used to contain l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; A@@ social family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ er@@ ous Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left its social @-@ apartment according to a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ment with a damage to the amount of £ 50,000 because it has spread its neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash to Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after being rolled out of their estate , shocking the property co@@ oper@@ atives had been the property in an irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were tor@@ tured holes on , wooden di@@ wns have been picked up , trash was scattered on the floor , and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to the walls . &quot;
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , working for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repair . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I believe people do not have to live in this way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider because this property is probably seen as not as beautiful part Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is it too .
&quot; the couple had three sons , which in the meantime lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had attached the family , road struggles with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ay , intimi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug abuse and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house that will be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found . &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past drugs , the wooden di@@ wns were ri@@ pped up . &quot;
neighbors said that they saw her on the road and had to be called the police on a regular basis .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ ine@@ ates her and her partner this week rolled by the property after giving them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
&quot; the dolphins were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours , saying that their life was made to hell . &quot;
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They rav@@ elled about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless occasions , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because there was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had administered the family with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which was called the police at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the expan@@ sive side of the common wooden house rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it is the ten@@ ant to accept all responsibility for their behavior and that of their family , as a del@@ usion is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
that was a very difficult case since the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions for their neighbours had to be terri@@ bly taken .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the municipality who have been courageous to us and have given us the information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will con@@ sol@@ ation some neighbours and gives the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ isting on the floor . &quot;
&quot; worker of the house administration will now have to be garbage bags , which surround the house &quot;
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis and scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash at a height of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was a def@@ endant after she had found himself guilty of the possession of a drug of Class B in commercial sight .
&quot; she claimed that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don was , who came to life in 2013 with an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many rooms of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police tell that they will enter tenants which do not hold on the domestic order .
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared that Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver would be a clear warning to the other tenants which do not hold on the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they might be able to behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who have been damaged by such behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continues to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists used in Portugal after having a ti@@ pping military jet beach flies
&quot; sun@@ an@@ be@@ ter in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of her life &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ ches P @-@ 3@@ C Orion plane of the air@@ planes placed an unbelievable storm
&quot; the air forces have passed that it was on a training excursion , but ins@@ isted that no security threat was insufficient . &quot;
&quot; this was the moment when tourists start to panic into panic , after having a ti@@ ghter Jet falls down over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed how the military plane was almost in close proximity to the sun lovers at the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; vac@@ ation@@ ers pointed out , when they began to do understand@@ ably , worry about the noise of the no@@ zzle work , without seeing at first , which came through the clouds on them . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many holiday@@ makers , the videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media post@@ eten , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would rush . &quot;
&quot; Nun@@ o arrogan@@ t added : &quot; I was just surfing and it felt so , when the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro seems to panic when the plane came out of darkness and flew extremely deep .
&quot; the Portuguese aer@@ ators were today sent to that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft on a training flight was found to identify fishing boats before the coast and thus fly so deeply , that this was the only possibility to identify them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet due to the poor visibility of view lies somewhat deeper than usual , however , ins@@ isting the air forces ins@@ isted that the security was not at any time at any time . &quot;
&quot; residential fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese forti@@ fication , in which four people came to death on the island of Madeira . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces gave today that the pilot had to fly because of the conditions - strong fog , and brand@@ y - so deeply flying , which restric@@ ts his point of view &quot;
&quot; the plane was located on a training flight , where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump Sur@@ t ″ giant problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states of the states . &quot;
presidential course of Donald Tr@@ ump was now weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can high@@ burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment , usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ at@@ illi@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after being thrown out of the race at 16 Rival &apos;s camp in the race , the doubts have now grown to its success in the struggle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump before Evangel@@ icals , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , wrong reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his known media @-@ media . &quot;
re@@ public@@ s and bur@@ gers w@@ ling
Utah is normally a safe bank for re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his competitor was taken by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front of the front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the Senate CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump on the question , how he wants to stop at Clin@@ t &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I did it before . &quot;
&quot; and whether back : this will be &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he do not make anything else , than &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for the sake of political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump further . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump shall report to st@@ submit funds to support his election campaigns , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
instead of doing the candidate of the Re@@ public@@ ans for the Congress to become stronger among the arms .
Olympia : rotation fraud on dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity .
K@@ eni@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten is threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud test on a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared with , will immediately set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan writer had told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ äu@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the Team@@ line K@@ eni@@ as by the dop@@ ing inspec@@ tors .
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information on the event , in order to strict its own research , shared a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF Declaration . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping Control station and has shown himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample released and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes on the list for the training controls of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich became over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ cht@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tik Heads of Directors and Michael Rot@@ ich were moved from the Rio Olympics . &quot;
he is intended to have notified against money and athletes of his country with regard to out@@ si@@ fying dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reporting , he should be arrested in Nairobi at his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
Kenya stands at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing verses for a long time under special observation .
&quot; during the announcement of the IO@@ C set up more than 2000 dop@@ ing targets before the Rio games , it was noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the vision . &quot;
the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , W@@ ada Kenya took Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight with the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a large runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Peking .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , again and again accus@@ ations were raised , that in Kenya D@@ oping means are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of the Sport@@ al@@ tru@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und also called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had attached her to the Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
thereby it could be proven that in this sport @-@ art and systematically ged@@ opt was .
Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten were then excluded from the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Festival shows the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musi@@ cal conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ one masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth .
in the orchestr@@ al dig@@ ging the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuel@@ an Di@@ ri@@ pper Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm .
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older wor@@ wor@@ e Maria .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y to her beloved with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I used as a ro@@ mer@@ in , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
poetry is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for the American film@@ maker Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up to date : &quot; this piece is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have passed the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are just as meaningful as it was at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; at the end of London , the IS joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA , one of three British pan@@ n@@ anny , who left London last year to join the IS , report@@ edly died in Syria . &quot;

&quot; S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died shortly after her family , after she had imagined the war@@ med country to leave and return to England . &quot;
&quot; you can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks involved in a war area - to prevent people from being able to ever make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA and two other school girls from the east of London put into a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass deser@@ ts
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation dialogue and world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un . &quot;
in short term the Kurdish community in Germany anticip@@ ates tens of thousands of protection seekers from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , there could be even &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the exile of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of hard advance of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup , the Kurdish community awaits Germany a mass cur@@ ses to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of thousands of thousands of people from Turkey in Germany when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to combat minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already passed over months in Kurdish over@@ bur@@ ners with sanctions , some 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the failed coup were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks .
many will want to begin anew in Europe if they are going to be sup@@ pressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that itself is taking up refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Council was compl@@ ained by the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in ancient cities . &quot;
to raise Erdo@@ gan on the remaining Kurds to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or exp@@ elled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the Council demanded that the Federal Government positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
also in Germany a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics did not take place .
in recent months I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len Movement was also afraid of the escape of many Turks .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed bags , incidentally also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ o@@ y@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported among appeal to numbers of the Federal Ministry of Commerce , the Turks presented the largest group in the case of political persecution of asylum in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on June 30 , these 11.@@ 386 people , and thus barely 29 per cent of all , were justified by any asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
in this survey they are not found before war , poverty or perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum justified according to the Basic Law are exclusively politically , therefore by the state &apos;s side , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;

&quot; in 2005 , the public election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in parliament decided already at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for flas@@ hes as far as far as far as it does not exist : summer holidays , heat , and land @-@ sw@@ ung battle . &quot;
locals who are supposed to be convinced by the constitu@@ ents are on holiday .
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen and Hid@@ den@@ see are not native to the country , so they are not allowed to choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters infl@@ amed , ballo@@ ons bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers and end up on the end voices , just ti@@ ghter . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last Feri@@ ent@@ ag , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass over into an election in just a few people over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thrilling is exciting how strong new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ veness .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its big pl@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did as well as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise it has got sea ering cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We have accelerated this &quot; &quot; the rise of right popul@@ ists , which probably will cost him in the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with their peak candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the wrong time at the right place of campaign . &quot;
she has invited Merkel chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel on a wholes@@ aler and Merkel ( Bundestag ) is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group does not coinci@@ de , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as the Meckl@@ en@@ burger and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; it was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it is shame to listen to anybody from other parts of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the nor@@ theastern CD@@ U is largely out of the usual choice of election on market areas and mainly shopping centers with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , so Kok@@ ert , play only a &quot; minor role &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that you are crum@@ bling on the country , that they must be very strict , again a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Greens , in the rest of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U Elec@@ toral College Kok@@ ert to its mit@@ es , however , is self @-@ revealing : &quot; they must go where it is doing , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; as much of the game stands , cel@@ ering has now called for a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last saw with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just shortly before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained a 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent prior to the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the surveys , should put the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue and embarrass@@ ed their election in the internet .
&quot; online franchise , &quot; it calls the national Le@@ aders Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green constitu@@ ents set off on a trace @-@ search for domestic stimulation among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , leading can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ t just with a house@@ boat by the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ ial lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; election holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : guest houses suffer from Sper@@ ment
&quot; the quick@@ ness , with which the B 27 is re@@ formed , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only at 8 p.m. , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; all of them made quite z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; tells El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff by the Jet gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
&quot; the construction site could be scheduled at the beginning of weekend at half @-@ time plan@@ ed to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; he will also be responsible for the construction work responsible for the construction work persons , for example , when it comes to setting up residence trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to the south and also the block of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg was again relaxed , the traffic situation within the village is relaxed . &quot;
people can now sail from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from the B 27 to both sides .
the so@@ fter traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the chief executive director of Florian King for the transport management of the rehabilitation agency Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ ar Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , A@@ haf@@ i Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ katze won and sooner its Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that some truck in residential areas for@@ war@@ es .
&quot; as well as the speed limit are not observed , the community called for the measuring @-@ vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable assault , &quot; says King , who made himself a spot about the situation . &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the fastest was at 77 hour @-@ kilometres at the speed @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site is continued , but it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
&quot; for business@@ men at the B 27 , it is only a small sol@@ ace that is now open for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; in the cards , business@@ men do not like to be happy . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to sales in sales , every one you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has little consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z is talking about a &quot; &quot; slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also a fact that of course the tre@@ adm@@ its is missing . &quot;
the strongest gri@@ ms are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds distinct words . &quot;
this is already existence @-@ threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it &quot; &quot; hard . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they were missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; on &quot; &quot; sales revenue &quot; &quot; he added to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road @-@ operation took its operation &quot; &quot; by two years back . &quot;
half of his staff have to be released .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been released , politics would have acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there would be a financial compensation , otherwise benefited from the advantages of the situation at the B 27th Now they also had the disadvantages , which result in renov@@ ations . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where such a funding was handled .
&quot; in all cases , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been based on the long history since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently subject to the complicated traffic unit , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can not go down , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; that its tribal cli@@ ent@@ el returned after the end of the refurb@@ ishment , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 @-@ works on his clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of work , this has been brutal . &quot;
is constantly sha@@ ken in the name of the counter @-@ control of laws .
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now lays down a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a D@@ ul@@ ating status have to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ an approach say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Com@@ öh@@ ner .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; the Federal Minister says in the presentation of its new safety package . &quot;
they over@@ demand anyone .
&quot; other , additional points would first be discussed within the parties . &quot;
also I am praying .
&quot; in the Minister of Interior , he is located in the midst of results , and in a &quot; &quot; for@@ dable consensus &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented a little time before he presents his conclusions for the safety of the Republic . &quot;
but this is the more the more extensive .
&quot; a lot has already been known , announced that a new security authority should care about b@@ aking co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines for air passenger data and weapon . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second startup for proposals that were not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups under punishment , and kill jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he will still consider this for reasonable and demanding nothing that has no chances during the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner . &quot;
a few new ideas presents de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they are partly in themselves : he plans nuclear trials for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for de@@ formation of people before de@@ port@@ ations .
&quot; refugees who are specifically fet@@ ched in the country , are intended to check their smartphones before and disclose social media accounts for a security check . &quot;
&quot; for viol@@ ating asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such that they commit crimes or throw away their papers to conce@@ al their identity . &quot;
some of that is politically and legally sancti@@ fied .
some even un@@ si@@ blings and leaves questions openly .
and for some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memorial for example - is the question : what does that actually do with certainty and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said in these things that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people in the face of the high refugee numbers were concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that the people are deeply busy , were not allowed to cling in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election campaigns . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
in the last days there was a high time between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ dener dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then over a security policy @-@ gathering of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , in which the Ress@@ orts also call a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère ar@@ du@@ t even here to the conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; from a return of a double pass , he does not hold anything . &quot;
we have upgraded the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to make new , do not make sense . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional to all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ an partners , it is necessary to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could be there for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attempting to pro@@ claim its inner security on the subject of inner security . &quot;
&quot; Par@@ c@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ aled first to careful discussions and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
still comes Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p through .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ and@@ als , the delivery figures rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
on the recall , there is a word about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts from the deliveries to the second half of the year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can still be a plus in recent years , despite the diesel aff@@ lu@@ sion@@ ary thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ lasting markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the core brand VW was weak@@ ened especially in Western Europe and due to the overall sales of such as the companies listed in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , the sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in the home market , Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the deliveries around almost a Six@@ th . &quot;
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weak@@ ly figures from July first of all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , it has been given a res@@ tra@@ int in some core markets by &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the UK vote also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. , where the g@@ asi@@ aff@@ ary first escal@@ ate first , there is also a minus to be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house@@ mark of the Nieder@@ sachsen continues to continue by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only an array of supply of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Fred Kap@@ pler could forward a sales spl@@ its from January to July . &quot;
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles delivered by Volkswagen in this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with a software package .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling about 2.5 million vehicles to upgrade to the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of the vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power . &quot;
&quot; the Autobahn post the customer after the re@@ armament an &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in business travel . &quot;
&quot; reason , legal imper@@ tin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen gave to its German customers now a guarantee of constant diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed by the last Monday VW agents in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
&quot; from the traffic Treasury , this meeting was confirmed . &quot;
&quot; VW has to fulfill the conditions of my enquiry commission and of the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ er@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) to the ministry . &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor @-@ performance after retro@@ fitting no deterior@@ ations take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was in business travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; &quot; Volkswagen provides the possibility that customers for example a half year after retro@@ fit can come about with a motor damage to a workshop - and this could be attributed to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in customer interest , it &apos;s important to avoid that there is any other damage that doesn &apos;t have nothing to do with the de@@ g@@ ass@@ andal , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demand from rich sa@@ vers in the future criminal proceedings - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Chief Apostle Josef Paul said on Thursday , &quot; It is about 139 customers to park the 40 million euros on gyp@@ sum or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German association German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal , &quot; &quot; normal Spar@@ er &quot; &quot; would not be afraid to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
bearings banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this charge requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and company customers for deposits over 100,000 Euro on gyp@@ sum or daily cash accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euro are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost roughly 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
he gir@@ ded over 40 million Euros which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not fail .
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; said the bank director . &quot;
&quot; I cannot put up to 4000 Euros for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he shall now give up costs after the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; just let the cash lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four over@@ laps , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the ban@@ kroll . &quot;
most customers would have an understanding and understanding about other assets .
only few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course in the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , be &quot; operational durable permanently not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for bank account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal control for deposits from three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Parliament and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank Fili@@ ale 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leader of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay single @-@ covers for deposits , this competition is far too strong in Germany and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ kers said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff , which is equipped with a lot of abundant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if it is free of charge . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ based cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ ar , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region you live known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria , Com@@ cooperative association Bayern &quot; are currently no further banks known to charge a single source for deposits of private clients , &quot; said spokes@@ person Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the German Stock Exchange and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June , &quot; the threshold , into the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it is the migration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany have not fallen into the width of the width .
destination plates : who does not actually buy records ?
lonely men middle age love plates .
&quot; before you hurry to the commentary box , in order to over@@ sow it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ le@@ age men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement direc@@ ts itself from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multi@@ fac@@ eted re@@ process of sound sheets do not want to boom a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als which would like to greet the news of physical objects but on mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
&quot; there is also no hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it , alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) . &quot;
but does the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o run , a modest gray suit and wild before I ste@@ ad@@ fast , my hands hold and somewhat determin@@ ant as : &quot; so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ hos is slowly turning to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent seller is located , there are still a handful of fantastic turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera out for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I follow from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages ) , a woman presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I already estimate &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels . &quot;
&quot; these record plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by e @-@ mail ) , dress the walls of his bedroom . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a si@@ zable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to be able to buy when they were released , when he was selling , when he was young and ple@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; many things that I buy , are from the late 60s , early 7@@ 0s which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably too young in order to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and likes to spend alone time , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my L@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meet the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , who have heard about the com@@ eback and let yourself be prompted to buy back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from talks that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy themselves back their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of the turn@@ table of a particular age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the non @-@ contact payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound parts , of objects , the bl@@ iss@@ ful Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emp@@ t@@ iness or possession of material possessions than a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff of a record stack .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April un@@ veiled that almost 50 % of the people , who bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey took place also that 41 % have a record player that they never use while 7 % of those who buy a record , no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report I would probably look very concerned , as I blo@@ gged through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova Comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men intermediate aged ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the prec@@ car@@ nival . &quot;
&quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musicians . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones that come slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , which has devoted the record @-@ plates almost a whole floor , has a few audience when I puri@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle ages . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops , Wild Be@@ asts new synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ be@@ packing pop , instead of experimental jazz , no@@ ds from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
none of them looks very lonely but wet mental trau@@ mas are hard to determine if you are standing next to someone 30 seconds .
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the shop for several minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more of a showcase - than a big one .
&quot; she does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of records is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it is easy to listen to music from one computer or other way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a loved epidemic .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , from which is said that a new generation of record lovers is supposed to have inspired : urban out@@ f@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; while I give the semb@@ lance , I watch the jeans hot@@ spots , I watched a group of young teen@@ ager , which are group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Cros@@ ley turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see her - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; records . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects a quote on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camp .
&quot; a French Court rejected a proposal made by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial , this week the authorities argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ ed shops in which individuals within the camp goods , sell cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services , or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a couple of euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argued that these places should be low @-@ torn because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which will hold a fire risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that businesses and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups are not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also carried out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there were no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries , but spatial that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the precip@@ itation was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; cafe of the camp , the common destination is operated and 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on Asyl@@ um for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; cafe . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , the closure &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the Tem@@ pos@@ ing of the particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example at random points , where it would be dangerous for mobile measurement by police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway building or to sandy bridges with temporary temp@@ ting , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary leaf to meet the speed . &quot;
a permanent mobile structure can however be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles across several tracks at the same time .
variable speed b@@ umps as well as transit h@@ bot@@ e after time , driving and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in high @-@ driven state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer .
&quot; so that he is not simply cl@@ oned , he is lowered , so the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also disappear with safe out@@ si@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer according to information from Vit@@ ronic is tested in different states and is now also used . &quot;

great Britain fet@@ ches Silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold wins
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt at the final hur@@ dle in the shape of Fi@@ j@@ is , when compared with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ portation stage in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji inherited a master class in handling , Side @-@ Step@@ ping , post@@ ulate , line @-@ run and ro@@ her power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ ans of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was made by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - British fourth on that day - and they were able to be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they took New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ cs , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final . &quot;
but independent of that Fi@@ ji would have been a 15 @-@ man team in form .
&quot; it could be a sol@@ ace for GB - but it will probably not - that at least one Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : fi@@ j@@ is Chef Ben Ry@@ an , the former head of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind itself .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost her under Ry@@ an of each game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap is going to do , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and left the attacks GB@@ s from fun j@@ umped .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co . on , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with another four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hard to do the ball .
&quot; a h@@ itting fight against Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but it has Fi@@ ji only stopped . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner has a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ release and there was still one minute of playing ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed by further weak T@@ ackl@@ ing of the GB teams and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still da@@ em@@ nt . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB conducted fundamental changes to the half @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ or@@ ical gap ... for all four minutes , what was good for the conditions of the first half time , until Joshua t@@ is@@ ova went through a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of South American sul@@ ans , whose fans were sm@@ elled , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing on the cake with a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the p@@ inn@@ acle , the Fi@@ j@@ is um@@ impover@@ ished and the GB ki@@ cked pl@@ ain@@ ly struck in the tur@@ f . &quot;
&quot; earlier in the day Fi@@ ji Japan was defeated at the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and UK pressed South Africa in a scarce half match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the ground up in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored one gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant delay of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for ro@@ wing .
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than in those games and that wants to hot .
&quot; from the first ro@@ wing to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , who go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in its golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ u@@ ated to the second Olympic War in two without a tax consultant in a row , the first women in the history of British sports which made such a scale . &quot;
&quot; your dominance was absolutely , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ ra@@ ined use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athle@@ tics who are guided over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ges , which is not reflected the kind of p@@ om@@ p@@ he ge@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the ro@@ wing , a batt@@ ali@@ on of wild supporters , which contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that would make the difference and there was no one of the f@@ more than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
how he said he was risky .
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a quite bad situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could begin at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start what the interruption held to a minimum , in case that in such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; ro@@ wing itself is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the un@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ irrit@@ ating morning so I tried to talk about anything else than otherwise and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repeated only , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and even Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not wish to have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no races in the last five years .
&quot; the couple had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents were not able to keep up with . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very busy at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it really is important to not be carried out .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking for something great . &quot;
&quot; we did not want fire@@ work today , we simply wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about its future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week at a wedding dress your own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
this would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took around six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ as . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; this feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years exemplary on clarity for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ ein@@ assembly &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes on reti@@ ring . &quot;
the Association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose linked to the great water producer .
he called for some time in the origin@@ al@@ on in a post by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; a little later , the water@@ forum of the government of sub @-@ fran@@ ken gathered . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ing @-@ group called &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; as exemplary .
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Ap@@ propri@@ ate association , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was now reti@@ re at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of latitude , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water each year and supplies 32 places and past@@ ors with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Wi@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , wides@@ creen mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was dis@@ continued and appointed as the managing director of the Direc@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extend from the water management and maintenance activities working on office and organisational activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency approaches to weekends , &quot; said the chair . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of the high container ( 2004 ) and the re @-@ creation of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the ponds of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there have been no stand@@ still , and you have resum@@ ed new additions because water lives and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Go@@ al &apos;s faithful , reliable and accurate service for over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used to have a great heart of heart for his water purpose , and he has lived by the water @-@ purpose , as if it were its own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was allowed to present as a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group to the nit@@ rate industry prior to the under@@ forum of the Lower fran@@ ken . &quot;
for this he received very much recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , on the one hand , praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks , who worked together with him 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water he@@ ater and he was a faithful knot@@ s .
together we were an unbeatable team .
as a clima@@ xes from his point of view he marked the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the restructuring of the expe@@ dient .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ pelines at the high container at Kirch@@ berg on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees we had to work throughout the night , so that the villages with water could be looked after . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained only because you filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt and filled with h@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; the management of the drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel storms from Lau@@ ter , who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler . &quot;

steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the @-@ fer@@ rous and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens resulting in the industry from the low cost promotion are of the table .
&quot; it remain in the liberation from the renewable energy environment for the so @-@ called &apos; own energy production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am really glad that we could have been tough after two years of negotiations . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to use the steel producer , the gases from the ho@@ ax to generate electricity for its own consumption , to the cas@@ hier . &quot;
the steel industry means additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year due to the German branch of industry .
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Y , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission following talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators in the steel works will be replaced , in case an EEG re@@ position of 20 percent . &quot;
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for the power supply .
&quot; thus , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; steel is future &quot; that is a first step .
&quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; considering the reform of the emissions law on climate and employment goals , IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has been suffering from over@@ arch@@ ing capacities and a considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation intensified as the world &apos;s largest producer @-@ country China threw in view of the weaker domestic demand mass @-@ based steel on the world market . &quot;
European manufacturers are throwing Chinese steel @-@ compliant price dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has somewhat relaxed .
&quot; for one show of import duties on import st@@ ole effect , for the other the economic prospects have eased in China . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price @-@ picked up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have been more stag@@ nat@@ ing again . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to close lock@@ ers of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , at the end of 2015 there were about 8@@ 6,000 people at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producer remain careful despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the economic association held on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the crowd went back to the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; communion , Spirit , Health : sing Sen@@ iors Sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; the S@@ ingen accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school@@ chor@@ us , in the teacher study , she won the F@@ ach &apos;s music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an seniors @-@ choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a rehearsal , they feel balanced , cheerful and more lively , says it . &quot;
&quot; in side by side , she does a good good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; for singing is a great hobby for seniors , saying Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German seniors . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; due to the regular meeting , senior social contacts can be made and nur@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; often , social and family structures solve in old age , a choir is an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her chor@@ us : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize themselves to be able to learn from one another and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being . &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
because exercising seniors a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; who regularly asks his lungs , either in everyday life not so fast from the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Association for Sen@@ iors organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher place , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , explained . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz is frequently observed that the singing or hearing of songs with older people ar@@ ouses many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
through Li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te and especially melodies themselves cr@@ ammed people from long rec@@ umbent events .
&quot; in addition , the head also requires a special achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on your own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singer - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; elderly people who live alone , so do not only concentrate on themselves . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one experiences through the singing in the chor@@ us means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
even the self @-@ esteem is growing by singing in the chor@@ us .
&quot; to show yourself : if I talk for something for a long time , I become better and alert over me - this experience will strengthen . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , there is so enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means , little talent to have , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;

cats react sensi@@ ti@@ ly as a han@@ go@@ ver on a cri@@ es of the young animals
Bi@@ ologists have examined the effect of the rest of kittens on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise the males did not let the males do not cold , however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens at the fle@@ ece of the little ones .
they are responding to ten percent faster on alkal@@ ine of kittens who have found themselves in great distress as scientists have found out of the veterinary university and the Medical School of Hannover ( U@@ hh ) .
K@@ ater may also react to the call@@ ings of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ cks of less and strongly aroused c@@ ubs for the males either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first authorized in the study that was published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens with the urgency of their assistance needs to be distinguished . &quot;
a total of nine adult kill@@ ers and eight ger@@ ms were observed from the zo@@ ot@@ ation of the MH@@ H .
you were played for a swing of little ones that were taken for three minutes from the throwing box and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger brack@@ ets which were additionally raised up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the low sample of the sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; all females , even those who had no own offspring re@@ acted , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
you turned out more quickly to the loud@@ speaker if this call@@ ings has played the very aroused sound .
this ability may be ad@@ den@@ sed or developed with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded at all , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
scientists in the past have already examined several times in humans the reactions of women and men to cri@@ tically .
&quot; also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , no matter whether they were mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski acc@@ esses with &quot; gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver has been issued an arrest warran@@ t .
accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey will once again take place an important football match . &quot;
in front of the du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between visits of Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul about the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clear : &quot; business as &quot; is announced .
&quot; already in the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow of the crash in July the government , the everyday life of normal vou@@ chers should not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
there is also not content before football .
against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver made a arrest warran@@ t .
&quot; accordingly , a member of the terrorist group is being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
ad@@ fast@@ r is intended to be tra@@ ilers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible for the coup Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup .
&quot; although the same is true for 90 days of emergency situation until October , actually it has no effect on the life of the most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country did Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for the end .
sport is - as the whole country - split into followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the Workers Club Col@@ labor@@ as traditionally count not to the friends of the president .
&quot; however , what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks but with dramatic experiences in history , the strict rejection of military put@@ ts . &quot;
even the fans agree - whether you are beating the heart for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or m@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , it will be especially coming back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
his sporting value presented the Köl@@ ner in the past season under proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old ended his first time as top scor@@ er of his association .
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ seals .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; sought him : &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and backed by his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the disappointing season was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion for the record master . &quot;
&quot; after the previous round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lion &quot; also appeared in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the south via Li@@ g they reached only to rank 6 .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this is what we managed and that is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master visits the game ran better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who were filled with 26 Se@@ as@@ per @-@ season as sweet@@ ness as the basis for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; in doing so , the Gom@@ ez had been announced at the AC Florence under contract and not be announced on visits to the coup , because of the political situation in the country after its EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario still wants to come to us , he must only say , &quot; &quot; stated the magazine &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; cl@@ ub@@ ber Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms would have to be prepared to refrain from around a third of its to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing , these athletes have even medals opportunities at Olympia in Rio &quot;
the 34 @-@ year old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others exagger@@ ated athle@@ tics and sinners can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio to medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the headlines from the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock its starting right shortly before the games , was mer@@ c@@ apped at its start ( 100 meters chest ) co@@ ver@@ al and bu@@ ed . &quot;
it offered a sk@@ ur@@ ry scenery : with a set sm@@ iles she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ okes its appearance with her appearance .
&quot; in place that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke into a j@@ ubil@@ ant storm . &quot;
&quot; however , there are many other sports@@ men who go to start with the Olympic Games in Rio to the start of the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is among the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked two times because of D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his spell the Olympi@@ ad from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion runs even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9,@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ ad / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) had to sit down a six month lock in 2010 after taking the pain of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , I had strong dentistry , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended themselves . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ ad of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 was positively tested on the bot@@ ene stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic took the know @-@ in intake and was imprisoned six months .
the four saus@@ ages in this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ ge ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world Champion over 400 m , had been tested positive and 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement may have been responsible , bet@@ tered Mer@@ ge . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the so far fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably there were hardly any athletes to be recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after being noted testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ D@@ op@@ ings and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; this also recognized bronze medals of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received due to a judgment of the International Criminal Tribunal of the Tribunal . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is on rank two of the world @-@ str@@ ing@@ list .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Championship and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the 29 years old world championship in the world were found evidence of taking one of the nutritional supplements by means , the Sper@@ re of the World @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran off already on 13 July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian enh@@ ancer in breach - Multi@@ berry T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stand with the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; she has suffered dis@@ ks and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
her home @-@ trip was scheduled for early September at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stood in close contact with the local authorities , as Schn@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; at approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok @-@ Hua H@@ in , we were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a walk @-@ quarter two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to police a Thailand has been killed and some 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three states and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , two explo@@ sives went high , according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning a bombar@@ d@@ ment was reported .
at the de@@ ton@@ ation near the popular beach in Pat@@ ong a taxi driver has been violated a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , another bomb , which killed an urban Andes . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a flower , the spr@@ inkl@@ ings had gone into the air according to the prec@@ inct of the territorial police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ achment from Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the southeast coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said army @-@ Major Dan@@ ai Cher@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives - probably , however , it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern during the attacks , which is typical for the bombing of mus@@ li@@ cal separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or the international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage that limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ person in Bangkok . &quot;
rather it goes out that bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; during the past few days , the authorities would have kept secret references to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; unclear , which group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; police referred to its officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are still smaller bomb attacks , but they usually do not depend on tourists . &quot;
in Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the nun@@ ner@@ ed bombs , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends to provide the instructions of Thai security authorities in the same way . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ hear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
&quot; the attacks on Thursday and Friday , a few days after a controversial referendum held on one by the military jun@@ ta . &quot;
these spati@@ ally influence the military influence also in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to prevent chaos , while the country toward stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody unrest , holds itself too good to have led the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a handle for many years in the extreme south of the country sm@@ oul@@ dering insurrection . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
just a year ago in Bangkok the attack was killed in a popular Hin@@ du Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity &quot; movement &quot; has come into the Visi@@ er of the Federal Ministry for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; according to several coun@@ ties , also the constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists have put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; locking points for aspirations against the liber@@ ating democratic constitution , &quot; said Constitu@@ tive Chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
thus the migrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we observe the movement well .
&quot; the &quot; identity Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing of French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by over@@ alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional environ@@ ment@@ alists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , H@@ esse , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority is closely coordinated with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extremis@@ ts try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
&quot; the Islam@@ ists , as well as right @-@ wing extremism . &quot;
this is not a solic@@ itation for your own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are in a special way prone .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there were reports on contacts of &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D @-@ politicians from several Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , their destination and thus extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; it is important , therefore , whether such people have a controlling influence on the party . &quot;
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the marked increase of law@@ suits , attacks and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps , Ma@@ ate , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be ri@@ ghtful structures .
there were the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fri@@ day@@ group .
&quot; it can be quite , that further legitimate group@@ ings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other far @-@ right motives . &quot;
but a nationwide or pan @-@ wide control of legality ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were taken on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; likewise , Ma@@ ate vo@@ iced that many over@@ attacks on the account of people had not come into account before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the Tatra on Asyl@@ um on Asyl@@ um , were not known before as a crime , politically motivated or followers of the right @-@ scene . &quot;
&quot; many individuals have committed crimes committed before with right @-@ wing extremism , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who then have dras@@ tically radic@@ alised by far @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ans or world records the headlines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer play in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics center , the easily obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ its was subsequently made to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ year ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds his lecture and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather not a sporty figure who attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special start to the International swimming @-@ association .
this is distributed to make swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
&quot; since in e@@ dic@@ s the most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ it just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first sh@@ re@@ names took the lap .
some media marked him as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard leaf &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; over him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l , who does not play a role . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games in 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for medi@@ al attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea - when he had to take part for over 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ rene@@ tically was fired M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
&quot; the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old came to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games , and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot;

&quot; should it be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been an alternative video . &quot;
he then moved into the holiday .
&quot; won Donald Tr@@ ump the U.S. presidential elections in November , it would be relatively the same : &quot; ultimately it will be either wrong , or I have a very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the Candi@@ date of Re@@ public@@ ans in a phone @-@ interview with CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for the sake of political correctness , be it right , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ leadership comes after dis@@ appoint business
the consumer @-@ based company Gf@@ K sw@@ aps his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; admittedly , the cuts came out suddenly - but not quite surprising . &quot;

the fees per cu@@ bic meters eff@@ lu@@ ent from 1 October 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant in Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euro ) .
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will then increase again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sleeping limestone , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 Euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as mayor said Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) , during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ s@@ ister@@ st , found that for these se@@ wage systems exp@@ ired . &quot;
&quot; the Cas@@ endorf Market is committed to its legal basis , to operate the systems of cost @-@ covered . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lin@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg have to reach deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ag@@ ility increases between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt said to the Board , was a new kal@@ cul@@ ation of the fees for the se@@ wage systems of the market . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ stops from the previous calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the engra@@ ving ag@@ it@@ ator increased by Schmidt therefore , that it is with all three se@@ wage systems around relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have grave . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the se@@ wage of water in all three systems is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; in case of all three systems , it was not least due to their age @-@ age and repair work in a significant extent , due to their age of age and repair . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for World Heritage , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt referred to that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical aer@@ ation system due to damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ est , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and in the pond de@@ position Lop@@ p had to be implemented after nearly 20 years of operation the first tri@@ po@@ unding ability to be built in order to keep the water @-@ legal requirements in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; for these extraordinary expendi@@ tures the advanced staff of staff and maintenance costs were taken into account accordingly in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 still significantly exceeds the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the low waste of waste in the three systems , the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; he said Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs in the waste water in the past 20 years has been spar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned systems will continue to be prec@@ arious according to stone houses , since one could not extend the supply of supply of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal for these systems , because it is a deficit of deficit facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first on zero have been fully booked since October last year , as a positive 0.@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average duration of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer &apos;s price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.1 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods increased : food and non drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; transport and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell on clothing and shoes ( 2,@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine reports ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as pre @-@ mon@@ at in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education remains unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect as Asian caricature critici@@ zed
sn@@ ap@@ chat tells that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tive to race .
&quot; using its filter tool , it enables sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is already adjacent to absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a piece that could be of a Roy Light@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , cap@@ tive tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fers per day . &quot;
all mis@@ cuts flows to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism of itself in the past that they were accused of making the app Black@@ face nour@@ ishing or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week some users proposed a filter that gave them flas@@ hes , false teeth and d@@ ren@@ amed W@@ angen , there was some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by A@@ sians . &quot;
they asked whether these repeated controversy arose from a larger problem that the company has diver@@ gence .
&quot; the news and the outra@@ ge were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have disabled . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caricature of A@@ sians .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced rac@@ is@@ tism rec@@ alled the filter at vulnerable cl@@ inging .
other refused the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et was widely distributed over the photos that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and mild to be said unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ top of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not spher@@ ical , but that the yel@@ lowing is pulled into the down@@ turn extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ dra@@ wer .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are different in the race as their older opponents - could be more likely to be expected of sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , so it &apos;s much more difficult to keep such things un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , who works as a product manager and engineer working for the medium to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in a set of medium and in a telephone interview she said that she is believing that r@@ arity @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the reporting practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the great part white ; only male guides and ended up their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Zh@@ u , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that are working there , but not in positions they are safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any figures for the diversity of its workforce and points out its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it declined Sn@@ ap@@ chat to discuss cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a microphone , the company has recently set a personnel responsible for group@@ ing populations and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said in turn her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account is closed and added , &quot; &quot; I ask myself whether they need more user like us to say that that is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military guidance of ISIS &apos; secret services , presents Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military per@@ tin@@ ent members of the United States Central Command changed after@@ ward , in order to draw an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when the actual states on site would have allowed the Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Defence Forces , Intelligence Tu@@ es@@ cap@@ ing and the Wehr@@ budget , reported from great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analy@@ st , who reported how preliminary reviews have changed to the American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , who controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news , inform@@ ation@@ ic information , which were typically spot@@ ted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ de@@ ters , were regularly reported a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site have been allowed and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; noted a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Re@@ public@@ ally member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ sided report shows detailed ongoing problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi army .
&quot; although there are no direct indications that government pointed out under Obama assignments to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed to the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of the year 2015 many Central Command press releases , statements and statements prior to Congress were clearly more positive than the facts att@@ aches &quot; &quot; the report presented . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city of Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 the leaders of Central Command changed the post @-@ service reports to play the danger through ISIS in Iraq .
Re@@ public@@ ans sm@@ elling the Task Force into the life after it was played that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports from the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Services Committee published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of post @-@ service estim@@ ations to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; gave the highest ranking of Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. ship , &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of post @-@ service reports , &quot; &quot; har@@ med the morality in analysts and &quot; &quot; gave little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Schiff and Democrats have found no references to an intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts at a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ ter of the Pentagon , which were accepted by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person on the Pentagon , gave an opinion that the Defense Department did not comment reports of Congress while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes quite diver@@ gen@@ dering opinions regarding interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and Defence Ministry welcome a controversial discussion of these important topics of national defence . &quot;
&quot; the investigation on the question of a successful aviation campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Defense Department ) . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have however raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orable assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about this , as the then government headed by George W. Bush against the recommendations of many analysts just looking at the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led to Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to speci@@ fying government ministers , that contrary to the statements by the government strikes , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries could have been put into operation in order to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature because of his moder@@ ately positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced with Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK faces &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I do not belong to the people who keep their gates in mind . &quot;
&quot; however , that knows them : American sisters are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equ@@ alled in their group with Britain on the first place , which remain un@@ beaten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which of the two within their group of six teams will win the first and second place . &quot;
the first @-@ board will take a little longer out of the path that the other group will lead to .
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , American sisters have triggered a surprising host , four years after they landed on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and was the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sle@@ ger in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the most recent in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because it wasn &apos;t able to qualify for the cad@@ res .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work center in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have completely able to s@@ nat@@ ch the rest .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gate in the first half of the game with a feed@@ backs from the local area .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing board from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she carried out a Sprint with the flat ball through the left side , then moved into the middle and invited the ball to the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , which previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham said , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inevitable , a rapid decline of competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic tor@@ ch itself is a burning circle , from the wr@@ ist@@ band to s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tur@@ ner to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you cannot switch on TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue , without about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ app@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , would certainly have been sent under these known names that were sent to Prime Time , being built through sponsors and well @-@ being @-@ TV advertising , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fairy . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights at the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame is not lit up any event .
&quot; further from the center , some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted : air @-@ gun , ar@@ chery , b@@ admin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the p@@ umping swimming and may reign for a long time .
&quot; but if I don &apos;t think any arguments for my specific lover , let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a Olympic Event since 2000 , when it had been in Sydney , it has been so annoying for the last 16 years that many who asked me , did not know that it is a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ kind at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had been able to have an athle@@ te until 2012 , who made it up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to be able to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping @-@ jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for an un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a clo@@ wn@@ school than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an un@@ born enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clouds , but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that are essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , lifting and sal@@ tos ) before they end on the feet . &quot;
&quot; they are evaluated according to the official Olympics for design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are competing in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic vector is straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists must continue in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and dr@@ on , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes down and back , upwards and down@@ wards to the playground . &quot;
&quot; they do not only hunt the ornam@@ ental or the base wall , but in the television transmission also another height : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pose@@ ful quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator with tears . &quot;
but it is also that which I own to look at these games as something fatigue .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
an down@@ ward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she pr@@ elo@@ t , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessness like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , just dream@@ y , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is just as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will beam up the ends as part of a afternoon cabin to both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the middle of Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumor . &quot;
&quot; when the levels of consciousness can only be achieved by anxiety and the ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his to air rin@@ se , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators who ask political changes in Ethiopia to fight violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that tens prot@@ esting during clas@@ hes with the police were killed .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government has turned the country and turned into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses gave witnesses that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot on tens of un@@ weapons prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; in circulation , there are well @-@ being videos about the protests that probably last from the last or the beginning of this year , show how vulner@@ abilities are young people with st@@ aves while these were forced to make a hand against a wall . &quot;
the Chief of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an additional investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together , and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is cher@@ ished by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services closely collaborate with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded in a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continually inv@@ aded the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been constra@@ ined , whereby dis@@ agreements were eff@@ ected effectively . &quot;
&quot; many have been sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ians . &quot;
all of the youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground @-@ use until the stran@@ gle@@ hold with respect to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Eritrea is rising ; a battle for this z@@ ag , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ des that were more or less forced to dis@@ solve the turbul@@ ence over recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness after years of preventing Hin@@ kö@@ ll@@ n under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years have been a lot of Ethiop@@ ian in a position to communicate with the social media , as cheap smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are at regular intervals , especially at protests , so many people can still communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that conce@@ al where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians vo@@ iced that they gathered themselves to be prot@@ esters .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from the ae@@ dic@@ ans mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate beneath a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers , which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services , commerce and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebellion leader , was up to his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts are saying that he was particularly vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and use special officers to process opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime lacks in this fundamental skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ c on Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came out of the Tig@@ ray Region of the Ethiop@@ ian Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ es comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an erup@@ tion in 2005 after thousands against elections were prot@@ ested , according to the statements made by analy@@ st , apparently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; while the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ ested , even if it was less than in recent months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts from the Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure , such as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esting prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ian city , of Tig@@ ray run business and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming ever more di@@ gest@@ ed in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that the protests the US and other Western allies are bringing in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American administration used to be the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ski over the neighboring Somalia , even though it was recently shared that she has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West does not want to support democracy , he does not want his ally together in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin horror . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains its proposition Obama has been founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to all@@ ay the last controversy on Friday the campaign surrounds him that his repeatedly repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying position adopted new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of Re@@ public@@ ans whether he would be able to communicate clearly and to communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collaborators who seek to take him during a event@@ ful phase in protection , to explain in the peculiar position of statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after spending the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in relation to the claim on Thursday and ins@@ isted that he really didn &apos;t intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was opposed to the previous day , when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation completely seriously . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative radi@@ om@@ od@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t , Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by taking it reminded that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy , wanted to know the Republi@@ can Presidential Army . &quot;
the last storm of the criticism bla@@ ze on Mr. Tr@@ ump down while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of a down@@ turn to the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked to speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would make suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said , the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clin@@ tons of emails , but later he said &quot; Of course , &quot; I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language limits to politics and then return home .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; depending on how the reaction drops . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of crossing the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has an even more estimated sound , as its survey values are further declined . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist who was released on Friday showed a tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he rein@@ forces the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps jo@@ kes made his loyal compassion in the un@@ convenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps , was great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was a nearly unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ asti@@ ty , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream Re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor Minister , it allowed ISIS to spread out by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them up before each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he moved the &quot; poor , &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can not ! &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats taken over Mr. Tr@@ umps as only one more proof that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; pus@@ hes over the price from the market , cafe comes back in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ hab@@ ist cafe in Williamsburg , where you could pay only , there was no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years a good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ in front was displaced . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , which replaced the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
native people re@@ medi@@ ed it as the final loss in a genetically modified city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ uses wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and Ver@@ b now is a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York change is , there is also new discovery . &quot;
&quot; a revit@@ alized ver@@ b cafe opened in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accept credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els in the same es@@ pres@@ ine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are standing sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ni@@ es like cap@@ ers and su@@ cked oni@@ ons .
there are natural ri@@ iss@@ ars .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juice . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a static current of old regul@@ ators .
&quot; many old customers have also &quot; &quot; pus@@ hes &quot; &quot; with prices from Williamsburg &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was one such customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b closed , she gave a while the coff@@ etr@@ ack , she said . &quot;
&quot; I became clear that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has drinks again , even if she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coffee named a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a new long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of 2003 .
he went there before work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss watch@@ men and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a Gro@@ ll about that the soap business has taken the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ baked coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go on their offer yet , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez said that he has presented her to make her soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has more advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ local wants to fill the cold @-@ baked coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café expands to a free building .
&quot; for many customers , a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was tribal , and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entry of the Lok@@ as and the bri@@ dal felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed meal of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt , took a lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
as the gour@@ mets had President Roo@@ sev@@ elt a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water @-@ turtles .
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato p@@ ü@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with other people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the married couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both a food historian .
&quot; the last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was acted by the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential home in the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ ting snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in business since the exchange crash 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cas@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive pieces , while co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato p@@ ü@@ ree and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter h@@ ackers ordered , this was the pair for discussion about the food in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were Erd@@ höh@@ bro@@ t , liver cheese and B@@ ohn@@ en@@ bro@@ t . &quot;
&quot; they were prepared from an ingredient and something tri@@ mming , that the ingredient stretching . &quot;
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts get to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have laid down in the stomach as a lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ one @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; cre@@ ws of women cooked for male fiel@@ d@@ workers and it was served freshly baked Past@@ ete for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; the Americans were sent to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; A Square , &quot; draws the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the lar@@ aff@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense topic , &quot; &quot; lit co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as stra@@ ined was the new bud@@ get@@ ty : mysterious foods such as Bre@@ ad and cas@@ ser@@ ole were more stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ fs re @-@ confident , since chefs were able to hide un@@ matched ingredients under a cre@@ ased sauce . &quot;
fresh fruits has been replaced by cheap dr@@ yers .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of the American cuisine for years , became a very rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds were tried , since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing satisfaction had priority to taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition on noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues out : &quot; it was sur@@ real .
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the utility recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , Hou@@ se@@ ed@@ ler - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics , between 1923 and 1943 - the eating habits of the country is fine . &quot;
&quot; by sharing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household leaders &quot; and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ as such as cre@@ am@@ y sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square , &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical le@@ tit@@ bits . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm house of his kitchen , spe@@ iste he , like the million@@ th serious man of the world , which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked Continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost ver@@ gol@@ de@@ em dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was deli@@ ght@@ fully alien .
&quot; President Roo@@ sev@@ elt may have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had prompted him to have a stamp on his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ ited of a household with no interest in flavors led by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought out the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most relaxed . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country was back on the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot;
&quot; the couple were better understood when writing the book , eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example , how food could not throw away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded me : &quot; she actually made people sick .
there was the wind exploitation .
&quot; after the plates were cleared away at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and co@@ e a dessert that they had dressed at home : the pl@@ um of Roo@@ sev@@ elt , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick , modest recipes made a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no s@@ worn cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; every deaf is a bit reluc@@ t@@ antly to a spo@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e got three times a stroke .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he sat down his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ pped everything to save others the lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself has died on a fac@@ bom@@ bed attack of the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil war group , who has saved the lives according to the picture @-@ newspaper so far almost 6@@ 0.000 people . &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed homes and to make first aid in the war @-@ area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil saint , showing him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians at the radiant symbolic character in the Gre@@ ys of War .
&quot; but as a heroes he never seen himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have thrown four pieces of bombs over the Alz@@ hei@@ l district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remains of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; the image cited its last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest vert@@ ebr@@ ating is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually occur only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get married only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k up the ground of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he is in an average just 1.@@ 220 meters far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives there , the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Rob@@ be with this maximum speed . &quot;
this type of long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; at least of a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this span , which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world @-@ record . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the theory of evolution already existed for a long time , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are st@@ ony . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , and finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the spar@@ sely populated area of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in winter mostly only in winter . &quot;
about the life @-@ style of Greenland @-@ hairy people know accordingly little .
their time @-@ lu@@ cr@@ o corn her when they turned out to S@@ val@@ bard six animals with a transmitter to S@@ val@@ bard .
&quot; loot make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remn@@ ants of a Rob@@ be , another had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they chase sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the Iron and seek Kad@@ aver , who tor@@ ches from higher water layers down . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now looked at 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ia , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a con@@ ges@@ tion from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , analyzed them with the carbon @-@ 14 method the liner method of sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , which in it , are no longer renewed in it . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ ists .
&quot; their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s , as an atomic weapon of large quantities of this radio@@ active carbon s into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the length of a 220 centimeters in the length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ sen@@ ists contained a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ia had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts in their lin@@ sen@@ ists , which is caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland , an old age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters is even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length of a age .
&quot; due to one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters , probably on the threshold to sexual ripe and its age with 156 years was determined , Greenland , with the multip@@ lication obviously became at least one and a half of time . &quot;
&quot; also , this is likely to be a world @-@ record for vert@@ ebr@@ ates . &quot;
that such methane hydr@@ eme especially live in e@@ isi@@ gen waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland Greenland , in whose sp@@ eck at the N@@ acken a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism also often runs on austerity . &quot;
they mature then later - and al@@ um slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm up in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal gets heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than one gram Eleph@@ ant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate as soon as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
a very large animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
plots in a double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the council has focused on the most recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel provided the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated motorhome can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the ground@@ work , par@@ cel@@ ul@@ ators and ground@@ ing issues were clarified and the moti@@ ons could be made for measurement , the sale of plots in the residential areas &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße - In@@ struc@@ tions 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the par@@ der@@ at is convinced that the be@@ aks in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and touching seniors alike .

&quot; in order to include requests for the settlement of other commercial enterprises , related to the creation of jobs , joined with the creation of jobs , subsequently decided to change the municipal council , which can only be rev@@ oked in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the field of Lower @-@ lar@@ n , the industrial estates is already expanded there by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main can therefore compete in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to pick up jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence of financial markets and property markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets are continuing to operate from London &apos;s financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport , there is so far enough admission to them in the UK . &quot;
these are just using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ b@@ association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; counts five years with 10000 new jobs on the Main Event five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , speak the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines the responsibility of monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as further important authorities such as European insurance coverage E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , there was a large fund industry that cuts down , but also like Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach Frankfurt thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available business properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ners . &quot;
the Seine are also rent the r@@ ents for first class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than the Main .
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer a higher quality of life as the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ kings of corporate consulting Mer@@ cer stand the city at Square seven , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin to No. 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences , &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot;
&quot; but London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite the Bre@@ xit @-@ vote of the most important financial centre in Europe . &quot;
&quot; the correlation of forces : in London , the forces of forces : in London , in accordance with figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C pat@@ ch@@ it with Mer@@ ck
&quot; an American arbit@@ er decided that Gilead of Sciences Inc. decided to refund the legal costs which you created from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C Law , with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was released by a compensation of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , resulting in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medications So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior from Mer@@ cks , including the opinion of and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; on the one of the law@@ suit on Thursday , U.S. ministries in the Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead are entitled to leave the cost , which were created during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck attempts with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver illness . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , as Gilead and Mer@@ ck came to each other and took possession of ownership on laboratory studies , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir Prin@@ ted , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; they have set free over 2,000 civilians , held by the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared with the D@@ CS Dar@@ v@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters . &quot;

Clin@@ ique earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % Federal control in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published its tax statement on Friday , announced for the presidential election of the Democrats and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax exemp@@ tion of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ ique USD 1 million were trained for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in Rede@@ hon@@ or@@ aren ; former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million by the publisher Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on her term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ique &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his tax expl@@ or@@ ations of the last ten years . &quot;
you paid an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to put standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t Kamp@@ ag@@ rap@@ hero@@ in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri was announced in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump behind false exc@@ uses and withdraw@@ als are hiding in relation to his previous promises to publish its tax expl@@ ain@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax exemp@@ tions , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for its denial a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ &apos;s election campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the release of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advisor , to CN@@ N that he didn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the control inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can Presidential Res@@ p@@ at of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already re@@ vo@@ iced that his ref@@ usal questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , his business@@ men and various other compounds , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already thrown out on the subject and released a video on the internet , in which high @-@ level Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax statement . &quot;
on Thursday she talked about the subject during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what any other presidential election has done in recent decades , and to publish its tax expl@@ or@@ ations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump paid during the 1990s for two years no or only very few taxes paid , and an economic journalist of the New York Times reported on Friday a number of tax evasion and tax advice that could still be the case . &quot;
Bundes@@ taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor warning buff@@ ets which would make sure that people earn more than USD 1 Million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal as well .
&quot; during a voting event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ ekon@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters to exchange Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax expl@@ or@@ ations . &quot;
Buff@@ et said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump I was afraid of voters and not against tax authorities .
&quot; at Clin@@ t &apos;s campaign , tax protection has been going back in detail until the year 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the Clin@@ tons are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid for an effective Federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the fiscal statement by 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of its income as wage are related , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main funds was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clin@@ ique dividends and income from USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

Jewish director sh@@ attered Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media survey , after having betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not have Israeli pre @-@ election as the Arab guests had requested according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the list of the hotels . &quot;
&quot; the country was not listed among the countries , which can be launched directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in the year 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , is possible that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
instead the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i offers Bristol a way to choose Israel via its own call center .
after a declaration the director moved to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; cho@@ ke him , &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel staff said that the measure is a &quot; clear decision of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , &quot; which was made by the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it stood , the director rose even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; was cited by Lan@@ z@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ merchant you called this a &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were shocked and upset by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is borne in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to take the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident , a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which the people called a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ cut the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of yourselves , was it in a different post that was noted that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident , and &quot; exc@@ ite themselves &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports the mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not include a direct statement , &quot; Israel explained the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a speaker of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .

&quot; students took place on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system . &quot;
the police set Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ fired against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officers , to prescri@@ bing the students , which led to the police of rubber @-@ stories and Tr@@ än@@ gn@@ as . &quot;

trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Tehran in the year round 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted up , the interest on both Russian companies and businesses grew heavily in the country , shared with the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies use existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial use is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports had risen by 9@@ 1.5 per cent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran climbed by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the trading down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates back to Russia for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representative for around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily traveling in Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , from Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of tourists in Russia will be broken from last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that hopes of the ambassador to change . &quot;
&quot; personally I can recommend the visit of the towns Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ lon@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages have been completed .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next no@@ ff@@ ing of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the next two years , the top of St. Anna is determined to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several Sanc@@ tuary goals have been tested , and it was finally decided on the Bishop of Freiburg where this year was offered a special pilgrimage to this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , which was a special pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Pe@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stad sat down the way . &quot;

Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner cras@@ hes home when Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the male team Sprint Sprint Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the an@@ ker@@ chief , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the Jung@@ le and made the legend proud when he was rus@@ hed to take a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six Olympi@@ ate@@ ways .
they repeated the trick after taking place in March by rail World Championships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys only a humble sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a record .
ho@@ ys reti@@ res a gap to close the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed when they saw potential in the br@@ isk they now un@@ folded .
&quot; closing , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner put a Olympi@@ as in the qualifying rounds , but in the first round of the New Zealand . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap fell short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner had held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy of strategy made a large proportion of transformation , in which the execution was carried out in a higher gear to slow him and to make con@@ no@@ y and above all sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert , and fell Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ts , when they were on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ proof comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and make a name for me .
&quot; in the En@@ dr@@ unde , we have nominated a Olympi@@ ar@@ cher and defeated the World Champion . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was Hin@@ ts that he fell off at a very weak start . &quot;
he later moved this statement later and there was no one of England Riv@@ als .
with such a phenomenal victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags on the grand@@ stand as London . &quot;
we have joined together as a team in the last three months .
&quot; we came so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if this is a bar@@ ometer our progress in the last five months is that we expect a successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is repeated in the area of Pos@@ sible that it is repeated in a contest of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister was born ) - a yields of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the cheese is the same by Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part in the Sprint session , who starts today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely anymore to win alone .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; when he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ all@@ ists contest of the day , but there were more good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four . &quot;
&quot; they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which won in London gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of competition , at the Wig@@ gins with certainty . &quot;
&quot; he had forced himself up before the qualification yesterday , when he called for its function@@ aries to measure his height from height . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the women &apos;s competition , tomorrow continued and ended , lau@@ ghing Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ gav@@ ie in world @-@ day period 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is looking forward to a strong rail team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a flock of medals .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio have been shut down .
&quot; drama &apos;s drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton started in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bullying , as well as retirement from sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , when one sees the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like it could be the legendary reputation GB@@ s who has reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melt production of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy tra@@ ilers
&quot; the future of the aluminium re@@ mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria , as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at the game , since the plant operator will terminate the energy supplier and thus transm@@ its all delivery agreements , such as the supplier of energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant . &quot;
a Sub@@ si@@ diary set out for 20 years is going out in November .
&quot; up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land , are at stake . &quot;
no less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered when closing .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the melting of around 10 percent of total electricity generation is consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting , which led last year to close the an@@ ean power station . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of spec@@ ulations in speculation as to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which delivered the large aluminium re@@ mel@@ ing with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p can hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assuming that the plant is still operated in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting of electricity &quot; , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continues to be out that the contracts called &quot; backup companies &quot; should have been in force starting from November 2016 .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period so they will end 2017 .
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L is assuming that the contracts in the fiscal year will be contributing to the revenue , &quot; said the supply of electricity . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently restricted by the forecasts of strong terminology markets for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L divided it with the value of the contracts already written in its year @-@ off at the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting of Al@@ co@@ as ... the melting system or to ensure the power supply to the melting . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company told that it was finished in 2010 a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have entered into force for 2010 , even if it is not an explanation , why it has been res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting away in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements by analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land consume around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; power market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to crying , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ video , which shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except the problem of problem Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , as it ends the cover of their sister and ends with a classic twist : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;

&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , there is certainly a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls great S@@ ister Kim likes her what the Vo@@ gue cover is concerned , beaten ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West had to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a League for themselves . &quot;
the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ issue is for Vo@@ gue which is most of the most sold @-@ selling output of the year .
&quot; with a girth , resembles rather a photo band as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars is anticipated so un@@ addic@@ tive that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still le@@ ased before official announcements .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years were clearly more &quot; &quot; celebrities , the Mod@@ ules &quot; &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; the celebrities are &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebrities are not related to famous persons or are Reality stars or teenagers from today , who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) . &quot;
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared in the last cover , had the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade on one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jena &apos;s success does not like everyone . &quot;
with its Reality @-@ TV @-@ history Jen@@ ners was always tense in the fashion world .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the m@@ ist@@ pieces of the moment .
these feelings appear again high as the message with the show of Jen@@ ners came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
&quot; but on the mis@@ trust , it seems to pass by the point . &quot;
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the Sep@@ em@@ ber@@ ra of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she is running for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters will sell you pictures of their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
sold by her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; there are a total of 160@@ ,000 people each year . &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ ,000 of the most con@@ sign@@ ments of the country are presented each year by the common management centres each year , while the industry is based on the effects of further medi@@ ations on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and those who have no means for injustice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already exagger@@ ated , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , this legal centers will be able to lose another 30 per cent of its currency . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Municipal Institu@@ tions of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the last collection of the National Association of Con@@ feder@@ ations were revealed that thousands of people had already been rejected each year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the compl@@ aining of the German federal government . &quot;
&quot; the Queens@@ bor@@ der@@ land centres are chron@@ ically signed , which means that thousands of people are of important services that you need to be rejected &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and pressing debt , families , which were released by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will be cut by 30 percent in June 2017 , which means that thousands of helpl@@ ess people will be forced from Queensland with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal Minister for Defence , as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , to immediately lift these mi@@ tigation immediately so the people need the help they need to have in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government filled its commitment to lift funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customer communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump voting campaign was indicted after employees to have a weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign was charged with alleged in@@ action , after it was communicated that their campaign leader for North Carolina in February have directed an ar@@ ming weapon on a worker while they were in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the Landes@@ Court of Charlotte through Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have been awaiting that the business would be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a gun , laid his right foref@@ inger on the desc@@ endant , and r@@ ins@@ isted the run in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after he had compl@@ ained during the local and regional campaign guidance , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four other people had made the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i gave . &quot;
&quot; the indictment has only two days after the Republi@@ can Presidential Chancellor , as he said a crowd of crowds in North Carolina , said that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment people &quot; - Ch@@ uss@@ ars owners and arms @-@ lovers should take action if his Ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judge . &quot;
&quot; this campaign was clear that the media had gotten his words from the context , and that he would not be able to raise violence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ is complaint demands damage to the campaign for violation of duty duty and from Philip due to the violation of their violation and abi@@ ding spiritual damage . &quot;
Tr@@ umps Pres@@ entation in Hope Hi@@ cks was not reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip did not hesitate .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local News @-@ sender in Charlotte , announces that Philli@@ p is no longer member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; calls on calls for his couns@@ elling company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey of countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for government parties and CD@@ U are drawing . &quot;
&quot; this did representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government action in the north continues to govern almost further , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance to keep the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD over@@ threw the SPD of 3@@ 5,@@ 6 percent over five years ago on 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is still under the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left rose to 19 percent ( previously 18 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 per cent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses with 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) , the Greens do not hesitate to get into the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country &apos;s day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD &apos;s SPD would only consider 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they are still looking behind the Green with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the Pir@@ ates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and the Internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator arrived on the market .
the followers dominate the world today - its producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed nearly half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was rather wi@@ red . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which today would be for about two sel@@ fers with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , lovers can still buy the devices on the internet , but they originate somehow from the Stone Age of the internet era . &quot;
however 20 years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the computer show CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ mi@@ er format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit agon@@ izing slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be used similar to a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; quite proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator was the beginning of the smartphone @-@ era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Handy @-@ Spar@@ te of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market dominate the market that came all a lot later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people daily . &quot;
in 2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold about 1.4 billion devices , by Samsung and Apple , alone , are 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
global sales with the equipment is approximately 400 billion euros .
&quot; for this purpose , the well @-@ running shops of the my@@ riad App providers and telecommunications companies come out . &quot;
the smartphone has now created a whole industry around the smartphone .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough for the mass market was first arrived at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple chief announced Steve Jobs on the Mac World and introducing the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an Internet @-@ communications , easy to use by touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market they had seen . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the strings now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; at the average , each German is watching 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to take away the smartphone also , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , the Siemens Executive Board of Directors . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must channel the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only being built in our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the greatest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as it was in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited by the Games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will come again by creating new possibilities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities we will already produce 10,000 new apprentic@@ es@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were in London in 2012 , there will be such things that will think that the challenge of enlargement he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too large . &quot;
&quot; I was told that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will bl@@ am@@ ate ourselves on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers any questions asked him . &quot;
&quot; as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many , not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; enlargement is an option to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ted growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to leave the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion infra@@ structural investment programme in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented dirt roads in the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to supply a third round trip , which is supported by £ 16 billion by private investment . &quot;
the London Olympics were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the extension of He@@ a@@ throw is also one of them .
&quot; it is time for we to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw , as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of the England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse game &quot; regarding display block &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with Online@@ advertising money comes according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to handle ad block@@ boards , a &quot; &quot; kat@@ z@@ - and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there were signs on its Des@@ k@@ top@@ page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday told Facebook with that its Des@@ k@@ top@@ page would change the enco@@ ding regarding its advertisements , in order to detect it display , the recognition that is part of the page advertising is difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; but Ad@@ block announces , that there is a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man wrote by Ad@@ block Ben Williams , that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er @-@ battle between the Anglo @-@ speaking open source community and the ren@@ ditions are already underway since the invention of display lo@@ op@@ iers , and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest company has left in the fight for social media , is a strong indi@@ ces for how worrying display for the sector have become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people are used , almost four times so much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook on their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertising accounts 84 per cent of advertising revenue revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has on ad block@@ boards on desktop PCs aside , since mobile ad block@@ ers do not have effect on a Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears the investment of such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday told Facebook with that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad prize pool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a mu@@ te means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was lying in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to witness a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday during an suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman slept in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the streets , and were hit by several cars , the police of V@@ aud , said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a welding at the age of 49 years , with several vehicles , including a truck , over@@ ride , even wanted to kill myself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , which , as well as any witness of the incident , call themselves to report . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical step in such a situation , shared Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter , Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ ve , was founded . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoidable ?
&quot; that is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in each of the two cases - where one person ran out during the dark on the highway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian lies in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper .
&quot; last year , a poli@@ cem@@ an was acqu@@ itted of the forced killing , after having killed a man and killed him in August 2014 one night at the A1 , near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk and has become unconscious on the street , took the judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- that had responded to an emergency call -- on an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the near of Morges , should report on the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Klim@@ am@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once dwelling .
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably to be inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus by means of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with their hot , water @-@ less surface and CO2 @-@ density atmosphere once could have been raised in similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously been suggest@@ ing that the slow turn of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus might have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and yet slowly turned slowly . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and from rapid de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
the early Venus benef@@ itted also from a sun that was 30 percent longer .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ ents the slow turn of Venus their day @-@ side of the sun almost two months long , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ med the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of a large portion of the sun warming . &quot;
&quot; the results are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that has been similar to the evolution previously created by Plan@@ etary researchers .
&quot; although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans were darker and their water vap@@ or was burned from the ultra @-@ violet light .
as your hydr@@ o turned out only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the description of Avalon .
&quot; on Thursday , Patrick Roy stood back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado of Avalon and led to a small fellow @-@ determination process right in the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and realized that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado of Avalon , with energy , passion and certainty , the 50 @-@ year @-@ year Roy has expressed in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of summer long and much about it , I could improve this team to give it more depth to give it greater depth and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly adapted to the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right to make decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , the Roy held on 23 May 2013 , thanks himself for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me today about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has received the winners of the Jack Adams Awards during his debut season 2013 @-@ 14 as the best coach of the League .
he led the association to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision but Colorado was beaten and missed in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the description of this marked in the 2015 @-@ 16 season a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second wild spot spot in the Western Conference on five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the description of Avalon . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ dy labor@@ ers resume talks on strings
&quot; the labour struggles in respect of the remuner@@ ation for North @-@ e@@ ders will be exposed , while all armed parties set up for a new round of discussion at the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider of wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , carried out by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some full @-@ day meetings in the coming weeks , starting at the beginning of next year to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; the trade unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , a protest against possible wages of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shortened its ranks to its contracts in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company abbrevi@@ ation of the company follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities as a result of his me@@ at@@ re@@ union with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation resulting from the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish leader Dave Anderson met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest work disputes which had been held since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy which works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion spent on expenditure on new projects in North Sea in comparison with an average of about $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler provides rotation rate of stars in the constellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ qui@@ es@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star enh@@ ancer , the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in constell@@ ations are rotating at different rates , as well as in which context the rot@@ ary periods are facing the planetary process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the same of our results with other constell@@ ations , find out more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is located 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation , which emerged approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching an adult . &quot;
you are now turning at the fastest .
to peak rot@@ ational rates this gri@@ pping @-@ star large amounts of ast@@ ray @-@ winds .
&quot; because these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake an effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is age , its rotation rate begins to slo@@ wing down . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler provides the rotation rate of each of the star , by recognizing the time between the appearance of a discer@@ n@@ spot -- as sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more , more active stars revol@@ ve more than less massive stars . &quot;
Reb@@ ull compares the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower pi@@ rou@@ ters rot@@ ate as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , comfor@@ ted against faster rot@@ ors to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot in front of us what we would like to know more about how , how , When , and why stars slow their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears started with Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the U.S. bas@@ eball @-@ star in best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional return announcement , the 41 year old professional will be released on 12 August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ dbye &apos; to teach , the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star @-@ game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) stated . &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the league . in 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series .
his signature in one of the year of the year was sold 27 million US dollars since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as consultants and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
as player paid it Rodri@@ guez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ ang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he finished the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
with the Hall of @-@ Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays are only two more bas@@ eball players on top statistics similar values .
&quot; but in the glory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; &quot; - in the field , is controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the Super@@ star was released at &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
in August 2013 he was closed for 211 games at the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be the principal susp@@ ects for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida .
after a legal dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for the year 2014 , because I have played for 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at that time . &quot;
even his farewell days go not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games still get the big stage once , Rodri@@ guez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win any game , &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez received , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson in . sympathy of fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ riv@@ als Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; s@@ aves the p@@ endant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive d@@ op@@ ing@@ test , weights for Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski may not start from Poland in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 were over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official d@@ op@@ ing@@ cases .
a caught Ath@@ ali@@ on would have been almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ incidents have become known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter @-@ obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish weights for Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski have been tested positive in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news is coming to the period . &quot;
Ch@@ en has been proven in the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday that is used as a mas@@ king remedy for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CAS confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the finale over 100 m butter@@ fly occupied only by 0.@@ 09 seconds they missed the bronze medals .
on Friday Ch@@ en had to take part in the trials over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing for the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation among the investigations &quot; , &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS responsible for the san@@ itation of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
also in the night of Rio pic@@ tured the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa through the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my four test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; they be innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tics &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act with the botanical substance in order to act the blood @-@ offering EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should already be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov mel@@ ted themselves immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ lon .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we Bul@@ gar@@ en are under review , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , such weight @-@ the@@ ber may not take part in the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday also the case of &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London @-@ Olympi@@ ad in Class up to 85 kg was tested positive on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , both may not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF had banned the entire Russian team until an exception due to systematic de@@ op@@ ings , the starting point of Kenya produces numerous poor news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the pool of swimming sports , the former publishers in China had also taken care of the athletes , even between athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t has attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad by Sun Yang ?
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested positively by the Chinese champi@@ onships for the stimulation of the Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de re@@ pressed h@@ ackers her ran@@ som
programmers of compres@@ sible mal@@ ware currently attacking companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the Mal@@ ware resistance specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes at 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies were at least once , partially several victims of an attack with black@@ mail@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims s@@ will@@ ingly prepared to use the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alise their black@@ ma@@ ids according to the Observ@@ atory from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , it falls significantly higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling fast evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered the compres@@ sor software for themselves .
&quot; first , private uses the target , but the change to company attacks was done very quickly in the last months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , she seeks specifically for un@@ long changed files like Word@@ Word@@ , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private useless the personal photo database is on the game , it is about sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production takes place . &quot;
&quot; accordingly higher does the damage falls , when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms generated sales losses by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the operation completely , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany several hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health acute . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : does not pay , it helps only the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , which pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in operation of the stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the security researcher of F @-@ Secure the commercial properties and the contact with black@@ mail@@ ers are examined and coming to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to make more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct accessible support websites or de@@ code for free examples . &quot;
&quot; and will enable private people to redeem payments of a few hundred euros , businesses have to pay some hard to negotiate and five @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing , the h@@ ackers are becoming more professional and sharing the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware circa within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their contam@@ in@@ ants then in the form of a software building to the actual presses .
&quot; the previous Mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in delivery is an adaptation tool , so smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ outs then look for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you are logged in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and asked another way to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is performed per in@@ sensitive calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually commission the criminal then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is known by many companies that provide their data better . &quot;
&quot; over 50 per cent of companies responsible in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , you can trust Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
the perpetrators already follow new strategies .
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not pose a sufficient threat to successful income , the perpetrators brought instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
this makes damage potential depending on the type of data that is much higher than before .
the perpetrators will continue to take completely new destinations on the internet of things in the future .
on the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con illustrated security researchers as they were able to get a thermo@@ stat under their control over the Internet .
in the middle of winter the activ@@ ating heating of such spar@@ ed heating so many victims may well be a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could be a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and all @-@ effective .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz was really extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have much space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls off . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in storage .
&quot; it is not just a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with highly @-@ made and 10@@ 26 l with cl@@ oned back , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , as it sounds : the seats of the back bank can be up@@ loaded like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and therefore offer storage space , which is up to the ceiling 1,@@ 24 m tall . &quot;
&quot; the trunk of the trunk can be well loaded , but the loader height is up to 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm , in wide swing areas very powerful . &quot;
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter with his work . &quot;
&quot; also , the omni@@ present consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is another mot@@ ori@@ zation : a 1.5 @-@ l petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
we are not offered an all @-@ wheel drive .
&quot; the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little more direct . &quot;
&quot; the equipment lets in the tested top option &quot; Executive , &quot; no wishes are open . &quot;
&quot; one of the security systems belongs to the City &apos;s emergency assistant ( lasts until pace 32 ) , the collision system and the run@@ way super@@ visor . &quot;
&quot; the collision sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes , because in the ran@@ kings many obstacles are evaluated as &quot; her@@ ding objects &quot; . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works the correspondence super@@ visor .
and the smart temp@@ o drives on the road detection and th@@ rot@@ tled when needed the speed .
&quot; full connectivity is available but only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI book@@ store are available under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much is Ben@@ zin@@ er from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emissions norm .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday du@@ sty car .
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on air traffic
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
&quot; for a liability is only thin@@ kable at dangers , which are typical of the air traffic , argued the waiter @-@ national Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken up in the fall of a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident would have been able to happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease incident : when paid the organizer
getting sick holiday@@ makers get back after their trip only if the cause of the disease can be doubt@@ lessly found at the hotel .
&quot; this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to be shown below the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the annex@@ ed case , a family was heavily sick on the second day of their door locks , hard to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that pur@@ pos@@ ely poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family had always been a lack of work - and mour@@ ned against the promot@@ ers .
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success before the court .
indeed the se@@ wage situation was indeed def@@ ective .
but the promot@@ er was just beginning to departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not hurt his information obligations , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - perhaps through infection with each other - belonging to the general living risk .
of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 sick .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violence of refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be til@@ ated and decided at the same time react to terrorist attacks .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph will not allow the terrorists to come . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if pen@@ alties would have to leave the country more quickly , but the level of security and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to implement the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another personalised strengthening of security forces , namely &quot; &quot; in medium @-@ sized proportions , over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should be again under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire should be circul@@ ated in such a way that most of all the purchase of weapons will be added to the internet . &quot;
the last much discussed is @-@ kept for doctors should remain in words after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the doctors &quot; physicians , he wants to look for solutions , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a look around mental abnorm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister holds a better social care for necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD boss Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Interior Minister clearly spoke against action . &quot;
&quot; this was a ear@@ nest for the hing@@ es at the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère Ru@@ fe had returned from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected .
a general ban on full di@@ ligence is not problematic for constitu@@ tionally .
&quot; you cannot for@@ bid everything you reject , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; you can talk about rules about traffic , for example in traffic or for witnesses . &quot;
green chief in Simone Peter made the Minister before he wants to simul@@ ate new anti @-@ terror energy and action .
&quot; left @-@ party Par@@ tic@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet sp@@ ings and a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the right to the right bring man no more safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the Autobahn
a picture is regularly updated on the railroad road - here a picture of November .
but that is to change : the dispute should be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car cyclists , who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night in St@@ au when you go over the highway in Zu@@ er@@ gen ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; the road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the departure Wes@@ eler street the right off track track about 700 meters . &quot;
motor@@ ists can then flow directly from the hammer street to the right .
&quot; the great advantage : the traffic will be at the early age , whereby the total run on the various section of the Federal road 51 is improved . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the driver &apos;s drive on the Zu@@ br@@ inger nervous the motor@@ ists above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the return way back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ west path and sometimes also beyond .
&quot; reason is the con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous watch at the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
&quot; from here , the traffic is only guided on the highway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be returned to a three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge no longer has the required gravity , in order to take in particular the heavy duty @-@ over traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated daily St@@ au will last , the relevant state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to count : because the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the loss of law , the country is deliberately picked up the busi@@ est time in the school holidays , because with disabilities to reck@@ on . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on the site on Tuesday and on Wednesday .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &apos;s &quot; Das Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a music project .
&quot; the Association of N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with migration and refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning song &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster .
in the context of the association N@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ ated &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; visited 19 students between eleven and 15 years of staging in the small house .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association provides the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to attend schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class are from September 2015 to March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the cens@@ orship images and video anim@@ ations it has been possible to follow the course of action , so the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the Association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg made of spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without air and migration background between 14 and 20 years have the opportunity to attend professional courses in singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal play and the@@ atri@@ cal language skills are in the planning .

rain instead of constell@@ ations : hope of we@@ ather@@ ing
the weather has made the star @-@ sn@@ ap gu@@ ts in the South@@ west of Germany during the night to Friday a line through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain for it to observe the cel@@ estial spectacle , said the chair of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather is supposed to be good , then we certainly see many constell@@ ations in the sky . &quot;
&quot; it is Per@@ sei@@ den , which are one of the fastest ones with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips about in@@ ges@@ tion
&quot; in the evening , you have been eating forever , at night you are awake , in the morning is already far ahead of the wake @-@ up of your sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , there is about one quarter of adult in@@ ges@@ tions and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently as un@@ relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep , and there can be varied causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eping medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you view , but is the in@@ som@@ nia , so an input and mess disorder . &quot;
&quot; precisely that can sleep many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory , or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the German house medical association with practice in the Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep @-@ disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can organic , mental or mal@@ tive factors , but also drugs are stuck . &quot;
not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disease .
&quot; very early waking up is especially common in depression , &quot; says We@@ ather@@ ing . &quot;
and it can be that different factors thank each other .
&quot; for example , who has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie badly , watches every two to three hours and begins to p@@ onder@@ ing the day of day @-@ to @-@ day problems and worry , there is one example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one deal with sleep in a doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ying We@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; impairment can look quite differently : one is tired , tired , un@@ retired , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has voting fluctu@@ ations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headaches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleep , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options occur among other things behavi@@ oral changes , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classic dormit@@ ories only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks - in@@ question . &quot;
&quot; in Germany there is hardly anything in Germany , Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the Inter@@ disciplinary Research Center at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore one should contact the primary care physician first at bed@@ time , betra@@ ying We@@ de@@ ur . &quot;
it can be resolved by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep laboratory , and what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; in order to study in the dormit@@ ories of medicine for instance in snoring with respiratory disorders , in sickness @-@ fatigue , in sleeping , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explained Fi@@ etze . &quot;
one does not really have to prepare for the investigation .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; just please do not make a mid@@ day , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after bon@@ ding one goes to the bed of his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body one carries a nose glasses , a chest strap and a boun@@ cing in the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is characterized by the ceiling . &quot;
how can sufferers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws where one can get for better sleep .
&quot; white counts on : regular sleeping and end @-@ times , not too long in bed , the day does not sleep , do not watch TV to sleep , alcohol , and at night not watch at the clock - then you start at once and that &apos;s not at all con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has to be
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler expressed himself by Facebook for dis@@ cutting the DS@@ V @-@ team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he was fet@@ ched gold at the short @-@ time world championship in Doha and presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athle@@ te Markus Dei@@ bler has put forward in the criticism of the ex @-@ team members .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ads gets 20,000 € premium , and a jungle or 150@@ ,000 € should not be surprised with the missing medals , wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming pool is bad , the dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look exactly at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls are to be set , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be reported in nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
it is precisely how you should keep it with countries too .
&quot; who does not have a certain time before the World Cup / OS controlled by independent controls of the W@@ ada / F@@ ina may not participate , &quot; says the choice of Hamburg , who has now operates an ic@@ ele . &quot;
airport : gang of baggage el@@ der@@ el@@ ded
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; civil crimes of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police succeeded in Thursday the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ ver@@ den@@ ies had committed several hand@@ ker@@ fs and luggage cl@@ amps .
&quot; towards 21.@@ 30 , civil servants involved in the area of Düsseldorf Airport a gang that was known for the poli@@ c@@ emen from the past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid July , and were highly professionally managed . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can leave the gas@@ kets , which were to emigr@@ ate to Germany to investigate crimes of crimes . &quot;
&quot; and they had a total of more than 15,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lenses , in between still a rest cob@@ bl@@ estones : the Rig@@ a@@ er street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police are among the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one gets along the courts , a fresh@@ rich@@ ment nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
to the facade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; bla@@ ed .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ d@@ l which should soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flat rentals . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; as the relevant real estate company called Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in , however , in recent weeks , however , preferred to be preferred with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have rental jobs , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year Hen@@ kel , Hen@@ kel , Hen@@ kel , since the beginning of the year , the police against the project has been pro@@ secuted , the region as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 described as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , had been cleared up by 300 police officers , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , bul@@ war@@ ped parts of the street and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ familiar home@@ owners the spaces .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Executive Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later the police and builders at the Ju@@ bel of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left force is not the main concern of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who have lived in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who ran for three children here , are mostly dominated by police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and cent@@ er@@ ti@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , which does not wish to have a majority of police officers in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , that of the Berlin interior and the police between house@@ holders and their neighbours , does not exist . &quot;
Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin actually was a traditional workers &quot; district which is also today in comparison to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
&quot; home@@ use and native housing projects have long been to the j@@ as@@ z : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street very close to the Rig@@ s . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under a large police force in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized by the people who had occupied it over 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from around the world : now divide the inhabitants of the GDR and former domestic ones . &quot;
this also has seen the r@@ ents that has risen by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ ean are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them by dra@@ ined discs or freshly pro@@ ver@@ ted fac@@ ades which were ej@@ ected with color explo@@ sions .
&quot; this year , no other road was mentioned as often along with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason is that not all neighbours might be considered as problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body breaking up statistics , according to poli@@ c@@ emen , almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
most of the criminal off@@ ences make Sach@@ sen@@ sed rather the newly built new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses meet .
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rental building next to the disputed 94 years , there may be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; in terms of violence , it is relevant : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , which were certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will not give it any longer in the Rig@@ a@@ er for a longer time .
&quot; for the studied architect of Archit@@ ect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary , &quot; &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ ean street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important to get the inhabitants of their street : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants , like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : through sighted new buildings in the former buildings that sup@@ press the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are finally con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so well cared for , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not do . &quot;
&quot; but what should one do , if one never stops someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration at all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for ten@@ acity , who are fond of color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who comes from , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls in a pub , there is bad about noise . &quot;
&quot; all persons issued only with pre@@ names of the people have asked , not to be called by their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact for integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders : refugees , working group for refugees , administr@@ ations , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the work circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the rus@@ hing wool @-@ m@@ sau , which has a problem above all . &quot;
&quot; thus , some - less mo@@ cking as rather on the multitude of requirements @-@ areas - meant to be pur@@ pose@@ ful , as the administration wanted to write the spot . &quot;
&quot; an administrative representative has been sought with a talent for languages and people , coupled with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social labor , just an increasing wool @-@ m@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been around for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position in three years with the possibility of extension .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and minor problems , organisational , human and inter@@ racial problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the washing road
&quot; a serious problem has been to be found for some time , apartments for the connecting @-@ line persons , which have been acknowledged . &quot;
for the connecting supply are the municipalities .
you have to accomo@@ date the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
&quot; the cost of construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes to the commune in the commune and the job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
there is de facto administration of private apartments .
&quot; it has not been working so far , one should be reli@@ ant on private apartments , as deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , the Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , it is practic@@ able , training courses , school places , one @-@ Euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be un@@ ning or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help house master@@ ing , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very tidy , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact .
&quot; that is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity means not only work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a belonging .
&quot; so do you need special offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here administration and volunteers are also jumping . &quot;
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling of being , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of procedures is a problem .
&quot; they must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Ur@@ bach , should not work and be useless , that will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but the problem is also , the customer says honestly , &quot; people , where nothing goes . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer very clearly , &quot; &quot; what I like to name naive &quot; . &quot; a res@@ tr@@ is@@ ko can and wants it not to be excluded . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ pers however already .
these incidents were also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into dis@@ call .
&quot; they want to show that they do not have anything to do with them , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would love to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region after activities . &quot;
&quot; in the background , they are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need a cap ?
that question is clear to answer is the policy .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would relax the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher can already be util@@ ised at a reasonable time , even so far . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , one need to help them both women . &quot;
the political world situation is as complicated as there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der with helicopter search
