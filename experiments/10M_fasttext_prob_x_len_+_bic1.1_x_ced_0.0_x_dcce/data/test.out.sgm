<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournaments in South Africa Bernhard Langer sought with some colleagues a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfers of all time - 101 tournament siege - again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He allowed to lead himself with his family over the plant of the ALRV on a horse he didn't take time for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">This was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">German Sporthilfe revoiced the man from Anhausen within the framework of a small Gala the Golden Sportpyramide.</seg>
<seg id="15">It lacks the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"federal Supportant, silver Lorbeerblatt, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year..."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinique and Trumps economic policies compared with: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP - they want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential elections are however in control and energy policies as well as in a fundamental problem."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the feeling rather small in doubt and warns that the state of the economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to put the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively increase regulations, and he makes for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the contrary, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has to open disadvantage and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, say Trump and Clinton almost wore."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classical democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the state-critical team of Bonaparte.</seg>
<seg id="16">So on Trump you could find some party discussion.</seg>
<seg id="17">More visible are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and rebuild coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil funding should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton is aiming to expand and asks the renewable energies with its investment programme:" a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want that we are."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazika trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US would not want to isolate the USA from international trade, but just better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better, and calls for about Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage from 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump does to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be, then he says he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics stop him, so the budgetary deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich that they will pay more taxes and their critics say, more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who alone escape, almost already for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four wives.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her small son in his arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier of social relief services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are frozen.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich north in one of the few decentralized accommodation for all-frozen women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich's Women's Aid relief.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it has been officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggeration to say: any woman who arrives here has made her flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically secuted, because they threaten to threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women there are several reasons for escape," many steal themselves secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary morden, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run that goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example for a bottle of water calling for a bottle of water is not uncommon," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">And the women are alone; they are not protected by their families.</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, all women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to some 90 percent of women living in Munich in the north of Munich, traumatized them."</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not voluntary.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so habitual that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't trust openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not cure yourself, it will need more accommodations only for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven districts of the district are responsible for keeping refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"whether or not she knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, please answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there are some kind of accommodation for governments not."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, women alone are not separated, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Lower and mid-franken are there in some common shelters or own houses just for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study that was published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or women and women are missing, it may come to - continuous violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this guardian, one can read at the crush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="5">"assistance and medical students have voted on the rejection of a contract in July about the rejection of a contract, which was agreed with the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of external lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight months long-term war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish counterpart at the gilded Hall of St. Petersburg's Palace in reception, I cannot repel the expression of Ankara that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the manual, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin has worked in smiles, and he took a little bit of heat, even for his long-lasting relationships."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report entire five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level in advance of the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day described a newspaper that Erdogan had heard that Erdogan as would never happen any worst.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather to indicate the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable radile showed that Russia's head was not forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory session: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutated burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin claimed and accused Ankara to please Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the failure was even bigger, as it was committed by a friend friend."</seg>
<seg id="17">Crauds re-establish again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"months long, the nationalised media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most of the most serious officials were the accusations of leaders in Syria, that Erdogan had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic state."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message was, that it is time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apologies that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara the advantages of a ceasefire clearly lie on the hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan requires first and foremost to all the friends who he can get after spending last month at a failed state.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially ban charter flights, which usually bring several millions of Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the public reviews are cheap, fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrams are once again allowed to be re-imported."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in vedemosti formalities it:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry with the West, since it has been a response to the tried power over power."</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued Groll over the Schneebempo of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the piping is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara with certainty that he called for the attempted coup d" I called for support for the elected government bodies. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-evident for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a profound fear of regiment."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, as a analyst once described," "Alliance of external lateral" ": two countries, who are committed themselves from the West and are badly affected."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after nearly three hours of initial discussions, both president spoke at the press conference, that they did not even trace the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately refused to respond to a question of its differences while Putin decided to emphasise this.</seg>
<seg id="46">"it is not a clear consensus on it, where a common denominator can be found in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for perfect Disaster, when NATO member Turkey joins the Russian battle jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to one another."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens mean: investors should be considered much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"the SPD proposes a" "action concept" "to the next meeting."</seg>
<seg id="5">But argument is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost about the question: who is supposed to build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group president Christoph Vimann says:" "we agree with the Greens:" "we want to build on urban areas, in the future 20 percent of all apartments should be interpreted as a social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be created in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big dispute in the Town Hall was, however, as violmann:" how is one going to build up investors, who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 per cent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments are building social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban construction programme, which will cost millions of costs and should still be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" "there is currently no agreement between the factions."</seg>

<seg id="15">The Left wants to be even hardness for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of how Bratmann, a tightening of the situation in the apartment market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the concept of action is implemented, will ensure additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is not entirely focused, because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">But what is the loss of further about 1300 cheap apartments in which promotion will run in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, so the planners of Nicole Palm, should now be bought by ongoing bindings of the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get homes back to the pricing."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one fell swoop the problem could solve.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the west town the end of the year are running.</seg>
<seg id="28">About 1800 apartments you could get back to the price of cheap apartments there.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners to use housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"after all, the number of social housing in the West city is increasing drastically, away from the goal of so-called diarrhea mixture."</seg>
<seg id="31">There is no longer a concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens do so that there will be even motion in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"naturally, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters who were first created for the video games in the 1990s (later created a cartoon series, game cards and other spin-off)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of the pop culture sank into account the interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the server overheads.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely sees the raw data for performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns for health, people want to bring about 30 minutes to take" "from the sofa" "to get active on deaf ears, because many public messages are getting boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be reviewed yet."</seg>
<seg id="19">"anyone regularly drives sport, reduces its chances to become suffering from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the wonderfull of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always there is also a native gamer, which must always complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is supposed to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps such as FitBit could already follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will be refreshed.</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked with Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Kraa Maga Verbandes in New York to find out how to handle armed robbers near distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how you turn off for your predators."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you turn out from behind you, then you should turn off as a first one, so that you can see your attacker and get off of the line," says Mizrachi. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbows.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with the knee into the groin and rotate you, while the attacker slipped up against pain, the weapon from his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards as they set the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on attackers, approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body from the skin line, grab the weapon and rotate them so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker to the chest, then rotate the gun out of his handle before they move back and set the weapon on him."</seg>

<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinsular bones from a traintoilette, who has already been used by thousands of others, may be totally repulsive but in fact they are in a kitchen sink more poor bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as about his own health."</seg>

<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to sinks up to dishwashing of toilets, the task placed its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he told me:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he did justice to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>

<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminomdometer is freshly made of fresh hands less than 60."</seg>

<seg id="26">Claiming that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how they are linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary that we could provide the consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>

<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who introduced the direction of the film, added:" "let me tell me so - I wouldn't have lost my respect for Ian, if he had taken some of the things I have instructed to him, like the ecclesiastic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, with which it was easier to bring them to socks and others, in which this was rather difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies to film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of the survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents have been associated with the well being of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they may at least occasionally use products used to contain lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said in these things that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people in the face of the high refugee numbers were concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you hurry to the commentary box, in order to oversow it under the pseudonym non-leage men with rough insults, this statement directs itself from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multifaceted reprocess of sound sheets do not want to boom a boom in Millennials which would like to greet the news of physical objects but on mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">"there is also no hordes through hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older tables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it, alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%)."</seg>
<seg id="8">But does the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a busy road in Soho run, a modest gray suit and wild before I steadfast, my hands hold and somewhat determinant as:" so, let us take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Sohos is slowly turning to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent seller is located, there are still a handful of fantastic turnaround."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera out for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and vegetables."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I follow from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages), a woman presumably around the 20), is one day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already estimate", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these record plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by e-mail), dress the walls of his bedroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a sizable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford to be able to buy when they were released, when he was selling, when he was young and pleite."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things that I buy, are from the late 60s, early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably too young in order to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted, rather introverted and likes to spend alone time, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my Laster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meet the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the Medienhpe, who have heard about the comeback and let yourself be prompted to buy back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from talks that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy themselves back their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to trailers of the turntable of a particular age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop such as Phonica, to realize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the non-contact payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound parts, of objects, the blissful Jugenderations."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a emptiness or possession of material possessions than a kind of consolation," "says WEZ."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is with me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff of a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April unveiled that almost 50% of the people, who bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took place also that 41% have a record player that they never use while 7% of those who buy a record, no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report I would probably look very concerned, as I blogged through a stack of Bossa Nova Compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men intermediate aged), has noticed a" trophy "of the preccarnival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came here only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones that come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, which has devoted the record-plates almost a whole floor, has a few audience when I purify."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle ages."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops, Wild Beasts new synthesizers and sexbepacking pop, instead of experimental jazz, nods from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely but wet mental traumas are hard to determine if you are standing next to someone 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the shop for several minutes and considers the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a showcase - than a big one.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of records is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from one computer or other way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a loved epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, from which is said that a new generation of record lovers is supposed to have inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the semblance, I watch the jeans hotspots, I watched a group of young teenager, which are grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are superior to buy a Crosley turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see her - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "records."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the sector and could send some customers to the depths of Sohos for more than there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, the one that is most for luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research reports that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through the record of Berwick Street and the leaves by plates, while they steer the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year false presenter, which protrudes over the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="5">That is why we observe the movement well.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" identity Movement "is a grouping of French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" Multikulti-Wahn, "" uncontrolled mass immigration "and the" loss of one's own identity by overalienation. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"constitutional environmentalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identity "already."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority is closely coordinated with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'identity Movement' try to pick up their target group, where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"generally, extremists try to address them with youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Islamists, as well as right-wing extremism."</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not a solicitation for your own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are in a special way prone.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"recently, there were reports on contacts of" identity "to AfD-politicians from several Bundesländer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this species are only relevant only from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, their destination and thus extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is important, therefore, whether such people have a controlling influence on the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the marked increase of lawsuits, attacks and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee camps, Maate, he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be rightful structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There were the group 'Old School Society' or the Fridaygroup.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it can be quite, that further legitimate groupings or small groups form the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps, or attacks from other far-right motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a nationwide or pan-wide control of legality ism is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were taken on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"likewise, Maate voiced that many overattacks on the account of people had not come into account before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the Tatra on Asylum on Asylum, were not known before as a crime, politically motivated or followers of the right-scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many individuals have committed crimes committed before with right-wing extremism, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or for example CDU, SPD or left, who then have drastically radicalised by far-right mood."</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inevitable, a rapid decline of competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic torch itself is a burning circle, from the wristband to swimmers to the turner to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot switch on TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbors in the queue, without about Simone Biles, Katie Leappy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time during the Olympic Games and a women's warm with dimples, would certainly have been sent under these known names that were sent to Prime Time, being built through sponsors and well-being-TV advertising, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even fairy."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights at the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame is not lit up any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, some in the shade are the sports that are not generally accepted: air-gun, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the pumping swimming and may reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I don't think any arguments for my specific lover, let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a Olympic Event since 2000, when it had been in Sydney, it has been so annoying for the last 16 years that many who asked me, did not know that it is a Olympiasportkind at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in the trampoline and had been able to have an athlete until 2012, who made it up to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to be able to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping-jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for an unenlightened ear for a clownschool than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an unborn enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never to end clouds, but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that are essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, lifting and saltos) before they end on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"they are evaluated according to the official Olympics for design, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are competing in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists must continue in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and dron, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes down and back, upwards and downwards to the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they do not only hunt the ornamental or the base wall, but in the television transmission also another height: the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even stir a spectator with tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also that which I own to look at these games as something fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">An downward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she prelot, seemingly weightlessness like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, just dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is just as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will beam up the ends as part of a afternoon cabin to both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumor."</seg>
<seg id="39">"when the levels of consciousness can only be achieved by anxiety and the tification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently proposed - then Mr. Dooley is expecting his to air rinse, new fans."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who ask political changes in Ethiopia to fight violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens protesting during clashes with the police were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government has turned the country and turned into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave witnesses that policemen were shot on tens of unweapons protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, there are well-being videos about the protests that probably last from the last or the beginning of this year, show how vulnerabilities are young people with staves while these were forced to make a hand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Chief of the UN authority for Human Rights is now calling for an additional investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together, and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services closely collaborate with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded in a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations continually invaded the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been constrained, whereby disagreements were effected effectively."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many have been sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the wilderness of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopians. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All of the youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground-use until the stranglehold with respect to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea is rising; a battle for this zag, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogades that were more or less forced to dissolve the turbulence over recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of preventing Hinkölln under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years have been a lot of Ethiopian in a position to communicate with the social media, as cheap smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government does access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are at regular intervals, especially at protests, so many people can still communicate via Internet Proxies that conceal where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians voiced that they gathered themselves to be protesters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from the aedicans mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate beneath a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of tigers, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in military services, commerce and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the rest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebellion leader, was up to his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopian Prime Minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly versed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and use special officers to process opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks in this fundamental skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemaric on Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons in order to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came out of the Tigray Region of the Ethiopian Ethiopian, Mr. Hailees comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such an eruption in 2005 after thousands against elections were protested, according to the statements made by analyst, apparently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following sweeps were killed many protested, even if it was less than in recent months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts from the Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesting protesting in Gondar, an amharian city, of Tigray run business and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming ever more digested in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that the protests the US and other Western allies are bringing in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American administration used to be the base for Dronenski over the neighboring Somalia, even though it was recently shared that she has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West does not want to support democracy, he does not want his ally together in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this" "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin horror."</seg>

<seg id="3">This clarifying position adopted new questions about the communication skills of the presidential system of Republicans whether he would be able to communicate clearly and to communicate with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his collaborators who seek to take him during a eventful phase in protection, to explain in the peculiar position of statements which he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after spending the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really didn't intended to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was opposed to the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation completely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as the conservative radiomodator Hugh Hewitt, Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by taking it reminded that Mr. Obama ISIS wants to destroy, wanted to know the Republican Presidential Army."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the criticism blaze on Mr. Trump down while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of a downturn to the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked to speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clintons would make suggestions for higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said, the Russians should hack Mrs. Clintons of emails, but later he said" Of course, "I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language limits to politics and then return home.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then" "clarify" "depending on how the reaction drops." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of crossing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has an even more estimated sound, as its survey values are further declined."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist who was released on Friday showed a tour with great lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he reinforces the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps jokes made his loyal compassion in the unconvenient situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps, was great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" said Mr. Giuliani, he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Obama was a nearly unknown, small organization, he called them hastity, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he moved troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor Minister, it allowed ISIS to spread out by bringing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them up before each of his words and be taken against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he moved the" poor, "twilight" "television experts who try to understand and said," You can not! ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrating is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually occur only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get married only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark up the ground of the North Atlantic at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he is in an average just 1.220 meters far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives there, the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a Robbe with this maximum speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">This type of long-term lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "at least of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this span, which means for vertebrates a world-record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in fact, the theory of evolution already existed for a long time, that Greenland-haie are stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to watch, and finally they live mainly in the polar sea front of the sparsely populated area of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in winter mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">About the life-style of Greenland-hairy people know accordingly little.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time-lucro corn her when they turned out to Svalbard six animals with a transmitter to Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remnants of a Robbe, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they chase sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the Iron and seek Kadaver, who torches from higher water layers down."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now looked at 28 Greenland-haia, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or Svalbard as a congestion from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, analyzed them with the carbon-14 method the liner method of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, which in it, are no longer renewed in it."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsenists.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore lie in the atmosphere after the early 1960s, as an atomic weapon of large quantities of this radioactive carbon s into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the length of a 220 centimeters in the length of the smallest animal, the linsenists contained a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-haia had normal carbon-14 amounts in their linsenists, which is caused by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimeters long Greenland, an old age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females can only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length of a age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"due to one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably on the threshold to sexual ripe and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland, with the multiplication obviously became at least one and a half of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">"also, this is likely to be a world-record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methane hydreme especially live in eisigen waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland Greenland, in whose speck at the Nacken a 120 years old Harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism also often runs on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">They mature then later - and alum slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm up in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal gets heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than one gram Elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal therefore lives more dangerous and should concentrate as soon as possible as possible as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>

<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep, and there can be varied causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wear, member of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Sleeping medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you view, but is the insomnia, so an input and mess disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"precisely that can sleep many people as unsatisfactory, or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the German house medical association with practice in the Anglo-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep-disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can organic, mental or maltive factors, but also drugs are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is especially common in depression," says Weathering. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a slipped disk, can lie badly, watches every two to three hours and begins to pondering the day of day-to-day problems and worry, there is one example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one deal with sleep in a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights per week, and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor, betraying Wear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite differently: one is tired, tired, unretired, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has voting fluctuations or physical symptoms such as stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleep, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options occur among other things behavioral changes, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classic dormitories only in exceptional cases and a maximum for two weeks - inquestion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany there is hardly anything in Germany, Professor Ingo Fietze, Head of the Interdisciplinary Research Center at the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore one should contact the primary care physician first at bedtime, betraying Wedeur."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can be resolved by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep laboratory, and what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"in order to study in the dormitories of medicine for instance in snoring with respiratory disorders, in sickness-fatigue, in sleeping, or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explained Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">One does not really have to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"just please do not make a midday," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After bonding one goes to the bed of his normal time.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, she is a social worker on site."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact for all stakeholders: refugees, working group for refugees, administrations, authorities and who else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the work circle indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now, the rushing wool-msau, which has a problem above all."</seg>
<seg id="8">"thus, some - less mocking as rather on the multitude of requirements-areas - meant to be purposeful, as the administration wanted to write the spot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative representative has been sought with a talent for languages and people, coupled with a long-term experience in the field of social labor, just an increasing wool-msau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position in three years with the possibility of extension.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle hone- and full-time actors supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and minor problems, organisational, human and interracial problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been to be found for some time, apartments for the connecting-line persons, which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the connecting supply are the municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to accomodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes to the commune in the commune and the jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is de facto administration of private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it has not been working so far, one should be reliant on private apartments, as deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments have to be visited as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, the Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, it is practicable, training courses, school places, one-Euro job and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who have to be unning or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building or help house mastering, do charitable work - and this motivates and very tidy, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity means not only work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say Deuschle and Customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so do you need special offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here administration and volunteers are also jumping."</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling of being, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of procedures is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must declare the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who will eventually develop the feeling that he could not help in Urbach, should not work and be useless, that will never be able to integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but the problem is also, the customer says honestly," people, where nothing goes. "the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two are afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine's customer very clearly, "" what I like to name naive "." a restrisko can and wants it not to be excluded. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helpers however already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into discall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they do not have anything to do with them," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would love to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, main and volunteers must keep on site and in the region after activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in the background, they are always in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">That question is clear to answer is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would relax the situation."</seg>
<seg id="62">"the Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher can already be utilised at a reasonable time, even so far."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, one need to help them both women."</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is as complicated as there are no simple answers.</seg>
