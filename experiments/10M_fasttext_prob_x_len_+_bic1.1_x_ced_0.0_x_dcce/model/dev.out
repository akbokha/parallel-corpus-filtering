Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Benjamin has not been very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as backing Tehran in the Middle East .
&quot; but in the encounter , it also aims to strike the conflict with the Palestinians and the deb@@ ated two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been out for many years .
Washington critic@@ ised the long @-@ lasting settlement of Israel and he e@@ ws a lack of commitment to the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of Obama &apos;s dec@@ eased deal about the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Benjamin Netanyahu has held a controversial speech to the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress which had been regarded as controversial in favour of Obama &apos;s aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was un@@ spoken with Obama , a meeting had refused to this at the time im@@ pending election in Israel . &quot;
in a emergency response Professor to have his girlfriend shot
in a emergency call Professor Sh@@ annon appeared with a somewhat z@@ itt@@ man voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would come to his house .
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said , the family contact with dead women could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was clicked on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
&quot; he did not give an indication that he was taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , and 300 miles on school grounds , where he has been teaching and killed a famous history professor of history , E@@ at Schmidt , at the door of his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ zi@@ ers Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said he did his ru@@ in@@ ous emergency call at some stage afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb was going to lay down his life , when the police gather him . &quot;
&quot; after a day after the s@@ late at the university , students and faculty seem to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what they do . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both sides of the state and about what the students and collaborators who knew him , helped inv@@ enting an image of a talented , but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students spoke that they were looking forward to some lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said , he did not have history of violence or a criminal record . &quot;
Schmidt itself mentioned a book in a written book that he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with which he shared his academic life .
&quot; both lined up in the social sciences and history , whose faculty is 17 members , and many students attended courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to be problematic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; he was a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers he represented , he seemed to be a bit excited and nervous , &quot; &quot; if something with him was wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb of him tells him that he had at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 with stress . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for a absence for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he dedicated only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university meant that promotion , made so hard for he &apos;s represented , would represent no guarantee of an automatic way of creating a Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything of a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Typ@@ ing . &quot;
they are questions we cannot answer .
&quot; after escape from the campus , the police took later Lam@@ bs , as he re @-@ contributed again in Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he &apos;s hus@@ band@@ with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber p@@ istol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents @-@ house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Co @-@ meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the Lamb was going to this house , but Johnson said that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
he grew up in the area .
&quot; represented in 2009 his work at the University , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , he taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he rehear@@ sed in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years of friends lam@@ bs distinguished him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb of 20 , when she met through mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool elder guy who tried several years to play her guitar game . &quot;
he was at that time of women &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls so@@ ons left , when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ay , now 40 and in the Jackson Pre @-@ town of Brand@@ on inhab@@ it . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no source of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick building that adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ls , Sha@@ wn O &apos; Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and a daughter who now was 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; he &apos;s Ste@@ en said he did he &apos;s mighty , but he heard his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he &apos;s interested in music and blues . &quot;
Lamb Pr@@ ist@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail played two years ago both on a summer year market .
&quot; later on , they played together one or two others . &quot;
o &apos; Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ arten@@ ders , and sometimes teaching coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar close to Gau@@ tier , said he &apos;s represented and re@@ inde@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time , after he &apos;s an represented guitar and harmon@@ ic orchestra in front of a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of that something was failing .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the afternoon and sp@@ ilt with one another .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , led the first semester program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , &quot; &quot; Don All@@ an Mitchell , a professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ium State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Brotherhood and the Student @-@ Committee .
&quot; the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland took some 900 people on Tuesday evening , including teachers , employees , students and members of the community attend a cand@@ l@@ elight ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts woman Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the watch of the &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; amazing grace &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s recorded from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press writer Em@@ ily Han@@ ster Wag@@ on P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans , contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected , to reflect that the police tell now that he did his emergency , and that Lamb in his emergency call was distinguished as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to set less labor force for the Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there is not so many Christmas season employees such as last year , but the toy and baby products says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it bi@@ ds , 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers in the whole country . during the Christmas period 2014 there were still 4@@ 5.000 labour forces . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company told that this month the number of talks will be organised this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December .
&quot; during the holidays , even months away , the holiday @-@ business is closer , and companies prepare themselves to equi@@ p time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox initi@@ ates his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
she was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming &quot; &quot; Back in Time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated s@@ wir@@ es , and an ar@@ as@@ hing @-@ length of that which can be in a Date with the Princess of Wales . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future &quot; , &quot; presents interview with Fox , Le@@ ah Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , and with the director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had been a premiere for 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Play@@ berg , &quot; un@@ str@@ it@@ ated the biggest concert film that was ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be seen on Vo@@ D , DVD and in selected cinemas in October . &quot;
&quot; UN Chief says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increasing military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader again calls for all parties , including the UN Security Council , to unite and integr@@ ative negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he is planning to discuss the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the margins of the Council meeting at the meeting in Syria . &quot;
&quot; it regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; do this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; B@@ an asked for the five permanent members to tackle the crisis in Syria , show the same solidarity and unity that they had demonstrated in the at@@ taining a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
&quot; 8 survey values , which demonstrate that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take . &quot;
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks among surveys , it has not worked ( yet ) . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump into a double @-@ digit range and some begin to seriously ask what it means for chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphas@@ ised that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys &apos;s leadership has been handed over to the rising level of C@@ ain , none of which won only one state into the Nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but external side @-@ groups such as Je@@ b Bus@@ cras@@ &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth should now recognize p@@ umps gathering , and begin to t@@ opp@@ le their dollars to overthrow him . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l isn &apos;t just a temporary phase :
gir@@ ly expos@@ ures have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump passes his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the Real @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l estate . &quot;
by mid July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; about three out of ten say that they have a negative opinion . &quot;
and these figures keep in early states .
Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac @-@ vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion from Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy about ro@@ gue as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week we told 67 percent of the Republi@@ can , they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; happy &quot; &quot; when Tr@@ ump would rally . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son provides about the same enthusiasm as the boun@@ ce ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , which tell the same about ro@@ gue ) . &quot;
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; mad &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the establishment of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , is the future . &quot;
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees g@@ umps and tem@@ per not as a problem .
&quot; during Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans and the Irish voters believe that the real temper@@ ament of a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number applies in the first pre @-@ American state of the nation , where the same 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he held the personality for an commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 per cent believed that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his job , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament was not p@@ asse to the White House , ABC . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when she beware of her nests , keep Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
if you are asked who most likely will win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet .
that &apos;s a change since the date when four out of ten at the end of July did their money to Je@@ b Bush .
complete Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters in the past did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the last cycle four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans , Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination before just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , a variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters has to be viewed as di@@ plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the Republi@@ can have gathered around another Candi@@ date , Tr@@ ump went almost every one . &quot;
some experts point out that the sh@@ ank@@ le field is likely to contribute to a small umps during the Anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ Support ab@@ stain@@ ed more than a dozen other candidates bl@@ ur@@ ry .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University early September shows , that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump the multi @-@ health support harvested . &quot;
&quot; he had gained a head prior to C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , prior to Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , prior to Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ es and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would lead the business@@ man with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on &apos;s head .
a scarce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans told they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little over half of the voters , the ro@@ gue assist , say they have made their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can truly say , never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to exchange for other candidates .
&quot; however , the m@@ umps is most powerful in the moment the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often used for ro@@ gue . &quot;
six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are consistent with boun@@ cing on immigration .
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called &quot; Rap@@ ist &quot; two months ago from Mexico &quot; Rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration of immigration and ful@@ crum at the public discourse in the public discourse . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic expression of the ump of crucial Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and def@@ use the new @-@ government efforts .
&quot; however , after the new ABC / post @-@ pol@@ l of Monday say six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans , that they are consistent with cl@@ unk@@ y with questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as migration is left in lim@@ elight , Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do so . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son is now about half of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the New Mon@@ days of ABC / post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ ders as someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied with 54 per cent &quot; and 21 percent &quot; aw@@ ful .
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive living rooms in Germany &quot;
&quot; here , in the Hob@@ oo@@ king Route , the most expensive residence system - with a view over the North @-@ e@@ watt . &quot;
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a prec@@ ep@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer of objects entirely limited , it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers of one square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student di@@ bu@@ de in Munich are not really a little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top place , one the price is given as a pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;

Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Go@@ tz@@ e
doubts about scor@@ er in Pir@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy team of Thomas Müller in Bavaria at FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran it .
a sovereign re@@ pr@@ el@@ ude of the Champions League season .
the world Champion Thomas Müller and Mario B@@ tz@@ e have taken a dream start for FC Bayern in Wit@@ en@@ kes@@ sel of Pir@@ aus a dream start into the &quot; Mission Milan . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won the contest in the Champions League with the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Go@@ tz@@ es W@@ ager ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting point in series will be the first step towards the finale on May 28th 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally pick up the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
&quot; Müller was in the Champions League for the Champions League of the Bav@@ ak@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which , at the occasion of World &apos;s Adv@@ ant@@ y , won one of the f@@ ou@@ les of the grand@@ master . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t be underestimated , it had promised Bayern @-@ captain Philip lam@@ m in front of the game in the Car@@ ais@@ ant &apos;s Stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot b@@ lossom fans - and the Munich &apos;s word holds word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated image , without shine . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ re@@ aus had won the recent six home games in the supreme class , including against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 the Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European @-@ up negotiations with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went fully courageous , in their very aggressive efforts it is often too resour@@ ce@@ ful to include works . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced by the si@@ ege against left @-@ ro@@ cks Douglas Costa , which has rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ g Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right side , than his f@@ langes of the right side @-@ field in the left Upper Tor@@ que . &quot;
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion left the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ ov@@ sky .
&quot; initially , when the Olympic @-@ lin@@ mer Ide@@ ally Brown struck the head@@ board of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then on direct di@@ ver the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5 ) .
although the Bavaria was the most dominant game of Germany it could place Pi@@ re@@ aus con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous .
on Tor@@ ke@@ epers Manuel Neu@@ er now was Lost .
&quot; like it , as he was a shot of ide@@ vine over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of Neu@@ er Gu@@ ardi@@ ola allowed a quadru@@ ple with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Dra@@ tz@@ e , according to muscular problems back in the cath@@ edr@@ ons , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the WC @-@ hero was just given after the final training given out green light , &quot; Sports previously said Matthias Sam@@ mer for &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to make something different out of it , that &apos;s mal@@ ignant . &quot;
&quot; with the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he brought King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Red Le@@ wand@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything is clear , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller was still standing there . &quot;
in front of the game it had gotten out in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mar@@ ched Bavaria fans in her audience , apparently the supporters of host Pir@@ amide with words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked , attacked security forces and went with p@@ hi@@ ves against the Munich &apos;s followers . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan has been brought to the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smo@@ kes , do not just indul@@ ged with the lung , but also the teeth , which lays the central Pots@@ dam@@ er study close . &quot;
&quot; the good news : if the risk pers@@ ists , the risk decreases quickly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is due to the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to smokers @-@ smokers was lowered the risk of losing their teeth prematurely , so as to get the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; basic facts for cat@@ astrop@@ hic are chro@@ mium and inflamm@@ ations of the tooth , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
smoking a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis empha@@ sizes the authors .
&quot; therefore , the link between smoking and loss loss is therefore directed to common teeth in smokers . &quot;
not understood to which degree smoking is also increased the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who listen to smoking could reduce their risk but inside a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of dent@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; it could take over ten years , until the danger on the level of non @-@ smokers , Mr. Thomas Diet@@ rich , told by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; the need to convince humans to become non @-@ smoking , the university manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking c@@ umped the life time . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads according to our findings also to good dental health down to a high age .
&quot; over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E shared with them . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking is reduced the risk of early cat@@ astrop@@ hic failure .
the new long @-@ term study support the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet at Köl@@ ner Rhein@@ us@@ fer on remn@@ ants from the late ancient world
for repeated times we have been made on the right bank of the Rhin@@ eland in Cologne archaeological finds .
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhein@@ boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ isches Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and res@@ te historical buildings were excav@@ ated , the museum manager Marcus Tri@@ er told the Tuesday . &quot;
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine a historian upon the search of so @-@ called bio @-@ monuments .
&quot; for all construction projects in the district of Cologne , the Museum is always dra@@ gged down in the archaeological grounds for archae@@ ology . &quot;
in the third chapter of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now five .
&quot; text documents have already been known that , on the spot in the 4th century a stronghold and in the 8th century saw a church , explained Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; along with the fortress and the cherry , there was also a cemetery with some 350 graves , which probably belongs to the church . &quot;
young woman from freight train
&quot; after a young lady is rel@@ aun@@ ched to the railway station in the violin @-@ community , the Federal Police seeks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early we@@ d@@ nesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am the woman crossed the road towards the railway station and was driven by a freight train , which came from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; through the capture of the train , it has been carried serious injuries in the police force . &quot;
it was treated law@@ fully and taken care of by life@@ guards in a hospital .
about the reason for the ni@@ gh@@ tly lead of the young woman there are no insights about the missing officials .
the incident has maybe been observed by witnesses or have been heard acoustic suspi@@ ci@@ ons .
&quot; we also ask people or pas@@ sers from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Zi@@ egel@@ b@@ ä@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) . &quot;
&quot; information that give information about the cause of the incident , can be given around the Clock and free hotline of the Federal Police boats under phone 0@@ 800 / 68@@ 88@@ ,000 or any other police station . &quot;
EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute
&quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen@@ ing the dispute over the planned Transatlan@@ tic Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
&quot; the imp@@ acted private arbitration institutions to disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transpar@@ ently system , which corresponds to a considerably more traditional cuisine in its functioning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that distr@@ ust the citizens , &quot; stated Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström in their performance . &quot;
the P@@ ete made a proposal to engage the proposal as a European negotiating positions in the free @-@ trade agreements with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP poses to 800 million people to the world &apos;s largest free @-@ trade zone .
plans for the reform of the current state arbitration proceedings specifically suggested that the European states and the US will choose independent judges for a new investment procedure .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU and US and third countries .

you would allow it to raise against judgment .
&quot; so far , the procedures involved with each other at the arbit@@ er , an objection to which the judg@@ ments had not existed . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system for fairness and justice , says Malm@@ ström . &quot;
in the long term it wants to work for its own statements on a International Investment Tribunal .
&quot; this could be clarified , in the example between the Chinese companies and the EU countries , for example . &quot;
this largely from big @-@ sided investor state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) considered one of the major reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitr@@ al @-@ courts are critici@@ zed as a kind of parallel violence , covering the payers of tor@@ ment to protect tax@@ payers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first statements comp@@ acted anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act adopted the proposals of the EU Commission as inadequate .
it is critici@@ zed especially that they do not apply to the well @-@ negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic secretary of Matthias Mach@@ in@@ nig ( SPD ) stated his plans on the other hand as big progress .
&quot; the commission studied essential points for the reform , which have worked out the Federal Minister of Finance Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU Trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration was presented from the table .
the French government welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE led to a number of new rules , the pi@@ ge@@ oning of the economy by too many new rules . &quot;
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could thus be disadvantaged .
when the talks on the TTIP TTIP ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) remained un@@ finished on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
the topic of investors had not been discussed with the USA so far .
originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year .
this date is considered no longer un@@ sustainable .

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ bie in the prime minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister with tension expected
the new Labour head Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and I put on with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of its six @-@ given questions shortly after mid@@ day and where his performance is likely to be examined by the media and by the S &amp; D MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said he could jump over several sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n &apos;s guidance , because after his appointment she comes as a member of the clou@@ dy and after his speech at TU@@ C &apos;s meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour @-@ President , on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them in silence to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence to be prov@@ oked by a number of T@@ ory MPs , putting criticism from a number of key pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision , not the national anth@@ ne An@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; he said a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n , he had been &quot; in dis@@ respectful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member by Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns clou@@ d@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ week program , he spoke to the Labour leaders , the National An@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of the hor@@ rors have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns senior team , and they are calling to differences in the economy , defense and foreign affairs , while less than a Six@@ th of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party was originally supported as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the political correspondence of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences were also shown within Labour , namely , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ ens to the position of the European Union and the limitation of wins . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ hav@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference that Labour proposes to remove the whole idea of a limit .
&quot; Mr Smith , who said Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and pensions Minister that the Party &quot; &quot; is very clear &quot; &quot; that it only plans against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair by Mr Cameron , since then he has T@@ ory leader since he joined the E@@ at Group over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour head , which promised a different policy approach , says he has given &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister is to confront , and that he fails to refrain from &quot; &quot; key resistance &quot; &quot; and to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Merkel , the shadow of an economic minister will represent him when he is not participating - as for example Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues sometimes seize the word and that John Ber@@ cow moves the speaker of the House of Commons to discuss the problem .
&quot; when he was appointed chairman in 2005 he said Mr Cameron wants to move away from politics to the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; who is often linked to prime minister . but , a few years later he sp@@ ear@@ ed him that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was regarded with the Prime Minister as a major bar@@ ometer of the ag@@ ul@@ er of a leader and his leadership in the sub@@ house and his position under his subjects , although critics argued , it has become a caricature and has long @-@ sufficient reforms . &quot;

Po@@ unds : acceler@@ ating growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound was decreasing after data , showing a rise in the wage growth of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was pushed through the blo@@ om target figure of SA@@ BM@@ iller today . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2,@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; this percentage was so fastest to the fastest time since 2009 , and brought assessments on the time of raising their interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound was increased by over 1 % compared to the dollar on $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was paid up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 44@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ finder , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
bur@@ berry shares were looking for ex@@ hilar@@ ating news from the competition for luxury goods of Ri@@ chem@@ a 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts most recent sales figures propose to all expectations , and also demonstrated that sales in China - a key market for Bo@@ berry - are to increase their growth . &quot;
&quot; acquired shares of Glen@@ core by 5 % , after the mining cabinet said he had 2.5 billion dollars through a public sale as part of his strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of packaging and paper company ass@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers in the index , and indeed with a decline by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s filed his assessment for the Company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D sport increased by 3.@@ 1 % , after the athle@@ te @-@ company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the chef of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
&quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employee , &quot; &quot; more buying power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this department increase the higher labour costs at his firm , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could be expan@@ sion@@ ed plans of J@@ D sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs . &quot;

&quot; in this respect , according to the authority of the agency , it has recently been protected as utility . &quot;

met@@ cash opens the jurisdiction of Acc@@ eler@@ ation campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ ac@@ -
met@@ cash attempts to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branch in front of an al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholesale distributor : cash has launched a ground @-@ insurrection campaign , in order to defend the market share of Ig@@ A @-@ retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two sales centers and first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ rology and Ig@@ A @-@ supermarkets to develop their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream media and marketing over events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A distributors and suppliers arose on board , with brands such as ice cream S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distri@@ butes Ig@@ A @-@ shops samples and shop@@ ke@@ epers , the discounted tickets for the South Australian football show to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that met@@ cash released further details of its defensive strategy on 29 September when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices carries out its annual investors strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia have almost 30 percent of Met@@ cas@@ ing Ig@@ A @-@ cargo business and higher profits as a Met@@ ric Ig@@ A network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; South Australia and Western Australia , purchases in South Australia and Western Australia have much more market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared with some 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di will cut off about five percent of the food market in these two countries after opening his first markets and take away all of the existing players , mostly self @-@ employed retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to the report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million sales of a year and met@@ cash may lose 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this prognosis was based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in W@@ A next year with a turnover of € 500 and 600 million in every market .
&quot; the loss in the food and food store and in the quantities on Met@@ ric &apos;s high fixed @-@ rate , the cash cash could cost around 13 million dollars of interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , met@@ cash market shares in eastern states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ bought is the most faithful . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Pro@@ cas@@ hes turnover in food and food store by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , will fall by 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week told the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , with a business eat in Melbourne that met@@ cash probably disappear within a decade . met@@ cash disappear . &quot;
broader medi@@ ums to publicly respond to the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass to Mr Dou@@ glass .
yet it is assumed that a board member of met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has made contact .
&quot; IG@@ As market share has pl@@ ung@@ ed from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hes food and food trading , which is approximately 1,@@ 200 Ig@@ A retailer , is shown in 2012 by 43 percent , which is reflected in comparison with current debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler however , however , inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to compare selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ s@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and because of improving their shops , by increasing rapidly growing fresh food and deliver better choice of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ ric &apos;s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice said that the show@@ ings and loading re@@ development programs will be part of El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profitability in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ ain is supported by the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ x Kok@@ kin@@ da deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ et Kok@@ kin@@ ain was one of &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and in the view of the president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly rather praise as criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; co@@ ca@@ ine , the younger and talented du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; emerged through the in@@ famous analysis of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA near Montreal Masters in lim@@ elight . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after they had to split co@@ kin@@ da and his opponents H@@ an Harrison twice separated by the arbitr@@ ator , where Harrison was having to beat : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to fight K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should knock the child . &quot;
&quot; recently , as he was recently seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis rac@@ quet , after a var@@ ic@@ f a potential US Open win was mixed by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was asser@@ ted by He@@ aly . &quot;
the teenage girl is currently in Glasgow in a competition with Sam Nu@@ oth around the second place in the single class at the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing that I &apos;m fairly fine , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi was taken a little into the dispute , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has been crus@@ hed a r@@ ack@@ et after he lost because of a cr@@ amp over the US Open but he is not the first player who has broken a r@@ ack@@ et from frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you and I believe that he was treated a little too little . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he suits the team and so on , he has never worked with the other players ; he is well trained ; he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision , K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os to take into account the important decision which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; &quot; common decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but it ass@@ ures the man of Can@@ ber@@ ra , as a long @-@ term permanent part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all the controllers around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; I believe Nick was very quickly pointed out of the rise to which people like Mar@@ au@@ ans and Mur@@ ray made clear . he goes to the public in the eyes of the public , but he &apos;s trying to support him . some time outside the lim@@ elight in which he can only think about it , I think it is best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared Not@@ with@@ standing , closes the border , holds refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary declared the emergency room and hung the border with Serbia on Tuesday , and held all who tried to come illeg@@ ally in the country . everything with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed along the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted in a no village of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials with revolt . &quot;
the people who fled from violence were pointed out for an unknown period in a stake in the road between the two check@@ points of the country and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations went on .
&quot; a police helicopter above them flo@@ ated , sk@@ inn@@ ed the migrants &quot; &quot; Op@@ ens the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling insul@@ ts against Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some re@@ marked by protest and water .
Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared that it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would be back in Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece .
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral .
&quot; in the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries are taking place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences of the non @-@ Serbian border came a day after the 28 @-@ UN @-@ block with a controversial meeting in Brussels made no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who suffered from Italy and Greece . they vo@@ iced their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called for a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigrants of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary set out its hopes for the return of Brussels or its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , in two southern regions , authorities gave more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could inhi@@ bit roads and accelerate grounds . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country is also planning to build a bar@@ bed wire , along its border to Romania , in order to stop the in@@ flow of migrants through the country after it ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ isted in the competition , the bar@@ bed wire @-@ fence , inserted between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few months Hungary is for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and a entering into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had ins@@ isted that most of the incoming economic migrants are seeking better life , and non @-@ war refugees who have a right to protection - a view that is strong in contradiction with other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall of us who fortified the government along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for condemned human lives . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation , which was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government declared the emergency condition , &quot; said government spokes@@ man tariff of Kos@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree with the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have heavily visited the armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor to Or@@ ban , said authorities 45 people trying to cross the border to cross the border , 15 others were penetr@@ ated deeper into the country . &quot;
they are coming over by sh@@ har@@ ming the fence they are now in custody and are accused of the off@@ ences of criminal off@@ ences according to new laws .
authorities are trying to fix the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials participated in the Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a train @-@ wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the fron@@ tiers . &quot;
&quot; chaos embr@@ aced the most important border crossing near Ros@@ is@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data from people and pressed there a crowd of people to get involved . &quot;

&quot; another group of migrants recorded the most important highway association between Serbia and Hungary , and said that they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary . &quot;
choice of 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s progress against Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to have a double @-@ digit head start in the democratic race at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ ander wins with her in opposite direction . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 % before ) , while opposing a second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ den , who had not yet proclaimed whether he can@@ isters for the presidential office , gets supported by 15 percent of the democratic voters of the previous elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the pre @-@ election , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidates will support them . &quot;
&quot; however , Clin@@ &apos;s suppor@@ ter will be more serious than those of the other candidates . &quot;
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while various profits achieved . &quot;
Clinton has a great lead in women and vegetables - but the proj@@ ections have reduced .
&quot; her support for the men has significantly dropped , and S@@ anders is just about 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ique &apos;s advantage of democratic voters is taking place under 50 years , and they are now at the same level . &quot;
but Clinton had a great lead in the older voters .
&quot; last month , Clinton had S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit progress on the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders has now got a 5 point advantage in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters in the elections were widely say they would serve with enthusiasm Clinton , if nominated by the party . &quot;
a quarter would support them with some advantages and another 15 percent would only assist them because it is the nom@@ inee .
six percent would not support them .
maybe not surprising that Clin@@ ama &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would it be enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; more than 48 percent of the democratic voters in the previous elections say they captured Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters so say this over their peak candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clin@@ &apos;s supporters can be asked in an open question , why they want them to nom@@ inee is the most common answer that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman President is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
their association with Bill Clinton is also mentioned in connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
consent to the handling of the problems and the constitu@@ encies will also be quoted .
&quot; the Vice @-@ President raises some potential for the presidential office on the scale , 57 percent of democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believe that he should not do it . &quot;
if democratic voters are questioned by the elections who for the Party would be their second choice is bi@@ den at the top .
&quot; by Clin@@ &apos;s followers , more than half , Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; finally , Bi@@ kers decided not to nom@@ inee for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton prot@@ ru@@ ding before S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in betting on 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fif@@ teenth , fifty percent of democratic voters see Clinton in a candidate with the best chances to win the election ; however , this figure is 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; be@@ eing is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage of the percentage you see as the chosen &quot; select &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important at a Candi@@ date , call democratic voters questions about the constitu@@ encies . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , there is not a single course of democracy or potential candidate for such vot@@ ees of the previous elections as unacceptable . &quot;
the candidates or potential candidates can deliver good results with some important features on voters in their party &apos;s elections .
&quot; maj@@ orities are viewing Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong executives . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds cuts in the three candidates most from honesty , whilst clinics &apos;s strength is the guide . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe in him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections are generally speaking Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all of these measurements , about one quarter of democratic voters has no view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; along with Hill@@ ary Clinton to use a personal e @-@ mail address and a server while ten@@ ure , most of the pre @-@ elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions were not influenced in all . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public as a whole .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion about this was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no effect on their general opinions on Clinton , although 36 % said that their opinion has still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them under registered vote : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month , and 15 points less than in May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 per cent of the elec@@ torate were not considered honest and un@@ trusted , but not tru@@ stable . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will not get some good notes on tour .
&quot; cut out of the six tested Candi@@ dates in Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as for Car@@ son we don &apos;t have any kind of opinion about him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son puts track of the national survey close to Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son &apos;s visit to the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times den@@ sely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; the two Candi@@ dates are now paying half to the support for voters in the new survey , and others are suffering dramatically . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters continue to support country boun@@ ces in great numbers . the support is 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted in the last month in the last month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son took the same period of 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son hit well with demographic groups and is covered by Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; rest of the field , except C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ governor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ dom in the Governor Scott Walker , which is at the deepest of the month , and 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida @-@ Governor of Je@@ b Bush the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place .
the bu@@ g@@ margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey conducted last week shows that Car@@ son is in the surveys - he covers 19 % support among Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the ro@@ gue by 32 % . &quot;
the latest survey on ABC News / Washington Post also showed the ro@@ gue clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at one last week &apos;s increasing Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump some side@@ hi@@ kers for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son adm@@ its to question the m@@ umps in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump the last Saturday during a show show in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the nor@@ theastern Mediterranean Sea is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bath@@ ers already a trip to the Mediterranean sea , to be found in a warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; as a result , there is no more part to the sea : 18 degrees Celsius the water in the North and Baltic Sea is part of this week , divi@@ des the German We@@ ather@@ service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Mediterranean Sea offers the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic coast it is 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the F@@ rat@@ ernity charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch &apos;s College
&quot; almost two years after a student had died during a religious ritual at a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI during a introductory ritual in September 2013 ended and hesit@@ ated his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; said officials said that he had been ham@@ pered with connected eyes with a 30 @-@ pound ru@@ cks@@ ack full of sand , and repeated attacks while he attempted to go through a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g won finally about head@@ ache , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ SI @-@ Brotherhood does not show the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before em@@ bark@@ ed him into a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothes , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national President of the Brotherhood to get advice , &quot; &quot; Political Power Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point the members , utensils hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood basically about that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ish@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ve , and he died the following morning to his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly inf@@ licted with mu@@ te force injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ p@@ ens of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 every year on the ship , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held to account , and that step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment due to murder in the Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ thirty members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with deportation attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the people involved but if there are an organization who has - officially or un@@ officially , this way we will hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch is banned the Brotherhood - and the national Brotherhood would vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group .
that will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest
&quot; tax evasion , and the house@@ se will rise in the trunk , ren@@ ders for bonds will increase , and the economy will lead to a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy provides a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came up within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve regarding rate of interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems respond . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have argued that investors should not focus on where they begin to increase the interest rates , but rather to the time period needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we could see market players however that the whole excitement because of a increase would possibly be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , leader at Capital City , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we are not expecting the gradual return of US interest rates to normal heights , but still too low level in order to be a se@@ is@@ mic shock that will cause many to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trend @-@ based look on how some areas of the economy might respond :
&quot; as the market in the last month has seen , the delivery of inser@@ tions can take place for a while volati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase matches , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that investments from 12 to 24 months after initial increase will be proved , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study , what happens after Z@@ inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely in the past 35 years , the market has increased generally during the last 35 years - about 14 percent - on the path to a raise , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , Chef plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ V@@ en Asset Management , near Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the height @-@ cycle and the return begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic activity , but their inser@@ tions often promote them often . &quot;
&quot; in the present case , the F@@ ed confron@@ ts with some conditions which previously didn &apos;t exist and which could speed up a recession . &quot;
&quot; extremely remarkable is this , that the gross Dom@@ estic Product will be in the proximity of its lowest score when a raising of the F@@ ed will be . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 @-@ Nation@@ als since 1950 was only twice of nominal GDP among 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was lowered by 3.@@ 6 percent , a few expect this to regret and expect only 1.5 percent in the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in a so fragile economic setting could be risky and throw the question , &quot; &quot; if this time is different , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; participants have taken the whole year on a tax raise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed to the session of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could find an increase in this session , there are only a 25 percent likelihood of fut@@ ures trading . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all smokers @-@ cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing pressure in GDP and on @-@ time resting very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shade , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest with the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession , the record was 35 months , and these are 74 months ago . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , since the market takes a tax raise , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than with shares , when they change its strategic course . &quot;
&quot; with bonds , the ren@@ ders appear to change the direction once the first increase / reduction in the cycle is done . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the increases cycle , the An@@ lei@@ di@@ ans immediately fall off , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ist of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will guide , that rendering between longer and shorter bonds will bring near@@ er and to a fl@@ atter of the curve . &quot;
&quot; total bonds often bring better income in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come @-@ Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting is , Jones believes that the markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are a few signs that the market has adapted to more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the earnings position is fl@@ atter , credit cr@@ abs have risen and the volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market , when the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole , companies that benefit the greater part of their business operations in the US , benefit from it , if interest rates are rising and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational corporations with high debts are getting worse , as an upwards of dollars to make their products on the global market more expensive and also financing their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story illustrates that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; accounts for three months after initial raising increase would be extremely positive , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with strong balance sheets have sur@@ passed companies with a growing balance sheet after each of the customs officers in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at the average by 5 percent@@ of points . &quot;
&quot; companies with high capital rendering , as well as low volati@@ lity in their stocks , their counterparts are compared with lower quality in each case 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) . &quot;
debts are a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will be lost most , &quot; &quot;
&quot; outside the clean stock , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; Spar@@ ta@@ ir could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham . &quot;
the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the body because of its &quot; du@@ v@@ ature &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is no longer different from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also paid back to the BBC Music Awards and said that she has mim@@ ated The Br@@ its .
&quot; Parliament &apos;s Col@@ lins Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the voice of The Voice and said , that this is not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliamentary union and increased new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something what the private concerned will not do . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio @-@ radio record &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t love the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to &quot; &quot; turned Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
he also noted the BBC Music Awards held last December .
the BBC Music Awards launched last year seem to be The Br@@ its only under another name .
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously examples which you actually just im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
the BBC &apos;s Director showed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to the public live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from radio 3 am , I will not get any other way about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; to find the dedication of Radio 3 , to find new music and to put new works , I consider it really important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that harder to be hard to engage the audience than they did in the past because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC &apos;s production , which came under fire during a hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sports for that it was put to the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
T@@ ory @-@ Euro Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up The Voice for the BBC - the musical talent show of the BBC - which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for estimated costs of 22 million £ .
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it isn &apos;t original and does not particularly striking ? &quot;
Lord Hall was ins@@ isted that the BBC 1 @-@ Show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - &quot; played in a special BBC way . &quot;
&quot; he added that he wishes the company &quot; &quot; a hit from our house &quot; &quot; barn , &quot; &quot; if it is the next time a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to give money of the ag@@ it@@ ator other for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet revenue grew in August at the slow and black Friday can be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of record in 2000
online sales increase over three years ago by using cell@@ phones to shopping
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down the issues
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping cart has dri@@ lled and many of the main shopping streets of Great Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that online conver@@ sions , when new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure on August achieved the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of record in 2000 with only five percent compared to the previous year .
experts say that online sales are st@@ agn@@ ant after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back in 2000 , Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y has evolved in the course of time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales were reinforced three years ago , as a purchaser began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do it in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now , this com@@ mu@@ ts , and we will possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for the subsequent turnover . &quot;
experts believe that buyer will hold their sh@@ opp@@ ings before this event each taking place on the last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers can get their computers to make their be@@ aks , and some dealers launched . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyer could not fought for bar@@ gains , buyers of which could prevent buyers from shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium took out of 5 £ 5 spending a bit more than 1 £ online .
&quot; on some products such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of the people are selling clothes and shoes online instead of in the mills . &quot;

&quot; hence King@@ fis@@ her , 200 further screens Shops is planning to open up at the arti@@ sans and 60 st@@ alls of B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten purch@@ as in the shop will be hit by women .
at the moment the men ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the men .
&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends , which had more female single @-@ households , the more renov@@ ations than they do in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; she still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift that stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients from women pay with 80 per cent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a big role in decision making process .
Mrs Lei@@ ry to see one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index - she also provided their top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company , who has occupied with women exactly 50 per cent of the team , including its management and financial intermedi@@ ary . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her , meanwhile reported a drop in the half @-@ year profit and the conver@@ ters , after the group drops the costs for the store of the stores . &quot;
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q is opening up to 200 new branches . &quot;
functions of A@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
at the national Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball @-@ vice @-@ registry A@@ I / DO@@ B are responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and subscri@@ ptions .
the def@@ endants did not guilty .
one of them had been indicted for abuse of ministers .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted in May full of force . &quot;
the current process was postponed .
&quot; according to the pro@@ secutor equipped with Robert Ri@@ ffel ( in the pre @-@ examination ) , the accused was able to disp@@ ose of the proceeds from the 2006 to 2011 by the Association of Stat@@ ute on which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was done with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also charged for financial statements .
&quot; that fact , the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ et , Ri@@ ed in Micha@@ ela San@@ in , was born . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; to the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that there was a asset in the association at no time . &quot;
&quot; the sporting scene could have only brake duc@@ ts and has spent a lot of time and money for which she performed a lot of time and money , carried out from debt - the pas@@ sers amoun@@ ted to about 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( approx . 44@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then we were facing the situation : do we conduct the club further , or block it ? , &quot; one of the def@@ endants , in the ro@@ ot@@ tom@@ f wholesale audi@@ tor of the financial market . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have prescribed money , our life insurance has been laid down as safety by the bank , &quot; &quot; he said with the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; it has been agreed with the association ; you can manage the money freely , unless we are allowed to pay any debts . &quot;
furthermore it has been agreed - with their financial - success the cas@@ ings of the allowance should been made retro@@ active until 1991 .
&quot; therefore , one part of the presentation could be taken only years later , namely from the year 2003 when a plus had been out of the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore also breaks with l@@ ump and not deta@@ illed agreements , the former Ob@@ mann explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; accounts and savings of the two def@@ endants jointly , said the second indic@@ tee . &quot;
why the withdrawal of the association did not have been in detail in detail and asked the judge in much detail .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail in finance for financial accounting , so it should only have the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , when it began on an active investigation for the abuse of information , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the German bank account . &quot;
&quot; these were withdraw@@ als , they made the accused . &quot;
&quot; this exchange account was applied to the names of the second def@@ endants , and according to whose statement they were not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; did the judge &quot;
to that the respon@@ dent did not answer for a long time .
&quot; finally , he said , he believed that this is the best for the association . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have been something of this money , the pro@@ secutor had placed them in the room . &quot;
the def@@ endant has been informed and legitimate the function .
this transfer was referred to as &quot; compensation . &quot;
why damage ends ? we wanted to know ri@@ get@@ in and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; the first indic@@ tee was the first indic@@ tee , he was not in agreement with this formulation , because the association could never be a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; With whom you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; when I was a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; he said the function@@ ary , he never referred to a cent of salary , he retained only mi@@ le@@ age and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; on di@@ eting , he added the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual cost has been much higher , he added . &quot;
detailed documents for the early years could not indicate the accused .
&quot; these are to be assessed after a operational in@@ ges@@ tion in which everything was considered correctly , no longer kept , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second indic@@ tee .
&quot; all f@@ ren@@ ders are held in cash , so he has to drive from his homeland of the international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing is given on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard st@@ ew other 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to current recruitment , the computer dance is going to build further jobs in the installation of the company . &quot;
the per@@ missions in the US @-@ computer He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) can be found no end .
the US technology concept plans to restruc@@ ture the dismantling of 25,000 to 30,000 points in its corporate clients . &quot;
&quot; in order to save costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.7 billion euros ) , the company will be saved on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the move will lead to a nominal value of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop out of the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing crash of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 still had around 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;

both business parts are to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; the again dis@@ positioned PC paragraph as well as a weaker demand of corporate clients , according to its services , is the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer after Len@@ ovo . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers had come back by a total of 1@@ 1.5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thereby the proceeds from 15 to 16 quarters went back .

&quot; the direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq , however , would have overwhel@@ m@@ ingly provoke rejection : 54 percent spoke against it , 35 percent dis@@ appro@@ ving . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : the pass of force to ser@@ b@@ ish @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took place on the present @-@ day border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ sten@@ eng@@ as and water@@ lamps against several hundred refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has witnessed the materi@@ alisation of the border control centre .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind that there was a police line and behind the poli@@ cem@@ an there was a water@@ front .
40 to 50 refugees began with stones , st@@ aves and plastic bottles to the officers . &quot;
the officials initially set their un@@ cut pepper spray .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ zel .
lots of t@@ att@@ as was spar@@ ed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is watched when the U.S. exp@@ atri@@ ates occur on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make an important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest has risen or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among 80 econom@@ ists who were surve@@ yed by Re@@ uters , found that a little bit more than half , which I wanted to do so , the F@@ ed will still do a slightly longer period and interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0,@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it &apos;s seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest has been applied to N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; for the first time we approach the situation where a large central bank would possibly leave the zero area and launches a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ sti@@ ff , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ llion dollars to add balance and generate only a small inflation . &quot;
however the F@@ ed cannot ignore the reduced outlook on global conditions .
&quot; she has warned the markets to hire one on an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is scheduled to be announced at 8 : 00 CET on Thursday
un@@ ra@@ scor@@ er to the Delta State University and took ap@@ oration .
&quot; after shooting and kill@@ ings of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues himself - Sh@@ annon &apos;s represented a note to say that he did &quot; &quot; do anything &quot; &quot; at first murder and wanted , &quot; he could &quot; &quot; make it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authority on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police at Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said he represented professor in geography and Social @-@ scientific education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , he poured on someone and killed someone . &quot;
he &apos;s an occasion to the employee of the emergency company that the police officers must send poli@@ c@@ emen at his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I created my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also said that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , which however no one will distur@@ b , but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not deliver him . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police performed the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss @-@ 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of represented : 45 , who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved . &quot;
&quot; after writing the notice he drove around 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he captured E@@ at Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when poli@@ cem@@ an took him . &quot;
&quot; university President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything of a conflict between represented and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs Typ@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he report@@ edly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ls had also believed in Schmidt a relationship , said authorities on Tuesday , there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; of a &quot; three @-@ relationship relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was rejected by Sha@@ wn o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , when a &quot; good person . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss are a daughter , the 19 is , and they were destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss are your daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; re@@ inde@@ ss worked online at home , following statement from L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who has been identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who had a dog named Light@@ ning , had represented with he for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
said the police officers went to a certain moment on Monday to tell them &apos; he didn &apos;t go into prison .
&quot; when poli@@ cem@@ an took him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in this night , he drove his car to the side , fled away , ran into the forest and killed yourself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s represented in the spring of 2015 by the Delta State University for a doctor in title like his priest &apos;s c@@ ł@@ aw at the university &apos;s website .

&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought for leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , because of cancer . &quot;

Euro@@ bikes : Lufthansa builds the Group for
the Lufthansa is planning a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa @-@ company wants to save one half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s around 1,000 leaders in the world will cost the job num@@ b . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot &apos;s union , there is now a new negotiation . &quot;
the Lufthansa builds up its company structure and values the cost @-@ right Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a result of around 500 million euros per year from cost @-@ profit and sol@@ ub@@ gi@@ as , the airline divided it on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , however , the Lufthansa will not be able to get more to the passenger on the flight . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the low @-@ floo@@ d@@ ie Euro@@ hoo@@ sol@@ ves can be developed as independent as possible . &quot;
&quot; in the managing team at the Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be in charge of Karl Ulrich Sh@@ atic , for Euro@@ bikes . &quot;
&quot; with the real@@ ignment , Spo@@ hr to the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will in future compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play for months because of double @-@ ups
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a dual frac@@ ture of his right B@@ one in the Champions League of Manchester in the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left margin of wine to tears and exclude him for at least six months from games , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w can be playing again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was included in the PS@@ V area . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before he was taken into hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg @-@ tigh@@ tening and lies in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he will be reloc@@ ated to Manchester , or maybe a day later and then operates in Manchester . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United , it has very hard and takes it fantastic , and then it &apos;s happening . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape , a red map and the im@@ position of a meter . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Go@@ al presum@@ ed that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I tell you were a fine me@@ ter@@ meter and a red card . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w &apos;s account : &quot; &quot; thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken it I am , my path to recovery starts now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
&quot; in turn , Manchester United would suffer the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the defeat of the PS@@ V . &quot;
the England Council members with the European Championship in France has an added incentive to recover from June to June .
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad violation . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , everybody is very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to violate an enemy .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ a@@ Holland Group at the 2014 World Cup 2014 . &quot;
&quot; he is doing very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear that it is a very bad violation , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing that I could see was the ball that was travelling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack upon Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels like , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dam@@ o was also brought into hospital - after a f@@ ou@@ tri@@ ke by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is a matter that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you are almost in@@ active . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child &apos;s book decided to chose the prime minister of The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice to write Cameron in a message on the website of the firm Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I liked to read my children , as there seems always a picture or a message that we have previously missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the follow @-@ up paragraph , where Cameron is said to resume the story of the book instead of playing a content notification of the movie &apos;s edition of 2012 , the new characters and details added to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the w@@ alled town of Th@@ y @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes a young named Ted , to capture the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , he reads a real tree , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stages was lau@@ ded and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s not suspi@@ cious enough : the text submitted by David reads partly as the abstract of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a child called Ted , to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he is giving a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is not familiar with the action of the book so little . here , an un@@ named boy , who said the local environment through the cas@@ cade , trees , bl@@ ur@@ red rock , &quot; which is in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; desol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR @-@ task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who wrote The Lor@@ ax not 20 times a consecutive time a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ Street @-@ Spe@@ aker commented that the text was probably come by Camer@@ ons Elec@@ tro @-@ Point .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s acknowledged it was delivered to the text of Camer@@ ons staff , but there were no more immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to run Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you chose the cad@@ res that England has chosen for the tour , there is a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series but not on my map . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would not shut out an upward victory . &quot;
&quot; A@@ last@@ est C@@ looks side is perhaps less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ offs in the batt@@ ing list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they will not bear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball develops Mo@@ een me as spin@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar dimension on test level , is an option for attack . &quot;
&quot; in relation to this message : Adam Ly@@ th is depar@@ ting from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der , and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; to let Adam Ly@@ th &apos;s decision , it is of course considered to be a new head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , very hard to analyse . &quot;
&quot; for his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are oriented to results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark among Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to nom@@ inations , because - and I have said that - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , the passage of Ly@@ th was prolonged , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he can bring forth further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come out . &quot;
the England &apos;s coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances and that does not surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
&quot; the question of how much time a test head@@ man receives , in order to put his mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th did seven chances - how Sam Rob@@ son came up before him , while Nick comp@@ ton was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance for home @-@ and @-@ backwards .
the only accus@@ ation that we can rise was that England first visited Jonathan Kr@@ ush in the Caribbean - as a ly@@ th in peak form - but this lost opportunity is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in . and he is a dr@@ one that I highly value .
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket players , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire , early in this season when he achieved 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which very met us . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same opportunities as those obtained before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to include Mor@@ een beside Cook , what a extra spin @-@ fi furn@@ ish and four Qui@@ et would get refres@@ hed , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a drummer could not beat there and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious code of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mor@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my previous team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he joined in 2001 when Open@@ er .
he had made three hundred of us immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Air@@ ari is born in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealings with it he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
people may see their statistics on - aver@@ aged 31 with the stro@@ kes and 35 with the ball - and think it is a pun@@ t but there is no large number of backup sp@@ ans that raise their hands and the coaches have decided for youth .
on this tour he will learn a lot .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Com@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advisor for the testing , could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , as it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is coming for the white ball during the tour and brings energy and a powerful use in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as player or as Coach , and as Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring a fresh breeze even if the news is consistent with the previous song .
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be playing at the One @-@ Day@@ er , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I for my part I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ ats and team members will not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs will depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .

David Cameron &apos;s new business development strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day without the choice of brilliant Jer@@ emy &apos; Do@@ es &apos; yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leaders of Labour and TU@@ C who suffered disastrous for Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners have also their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at said recently that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , such as the EU has been and not always out of own debt , Britain itself and not always opposed making concessions and disrup@@ tive agreements which they usually do not want . &quot;
&quot; Brighton decided the TU@@ C at its annual meeting , that it does not like it if it does not je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Ministers are climbing at meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes for the in@@ active Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Send us not alone with France , &quot; &quot; says Berlin - and now lets us know that more and more short @-@ sighted Ministers and officials from some main cities have come to the point where they don &apos;t care if we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany , war@@ med chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the ministry , before it looks bad for her , as it has happened with the exagger@@ ated long sp@@ lat@@ te like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande takes on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a da@@ zz@@ ling force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alistic right government , Spain has a left . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to imagine that she will get out a leg to help the Be@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used for Scotland &apos;s res@@ ignation from the UK - something they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers may well not inten@@ tionally be not helpful comments , quite at SN@@ P style , during Great Britain &apos;s introduction to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , suspected my friend . &quot;
&quot; the re @-@ negotiating was a &quot; &quot; P@@ ite &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; great Britain &quot; &quot; has not gained any value from the new trial . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory Street can be on its expense and what EU scep@@ tics is the oligarchy of the press in 1975 , but did not have been approved by Tony Ben@@ n @-@ inspired by 1975 but not that our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported . &quot;
&quot; they can remember little of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who has proved a name for &quot; &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade @-@ anas &quot; &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ 90s . &quot;
&quot; with all his promises , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing agents , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ downs and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ emp@@ t@@ ners who possess most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair thought much about it , but found out that when one sits with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , it &apos;s better ban@@ anas in order to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ an@@ er than Blair , as he expressed himself in the Interior Minister , because Blair had rejected the principle of the non @-@ Lebanese constitution of the EU , who was then rejected by French and Dutch constitu@@ encies in 2005 . &quot;
the press has never denied him .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me on Monday in Westminster a friendly l@@ ame on his back - I told him that he no longer need to waste time for me - he seems at risk of N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ s was a fault back then and now .
&quot; it can take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns official position on Europe is - I wanted it to be friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot;
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ending tendency and the wil@@ der don@@ ors of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes , everybody can say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary , &quot; A Ben@@ n , but did not have Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of the prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow consultant was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ he years , when his old father realized on television , he &apos;s loyal towards his labor cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - Ben@@ n &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , still what J@@ C told his comrades and representatives from all reports on their swe@@ dish at Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; what always wants to convey the pro@@ of@@ ed bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he has even touched me - News @-@ Leg@@ s remain important in the Age of TV around the clock and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ centre of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that permits him , lab@@ ours lending support in the campaign of stupid campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities in EU membership - in accordance with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ iz@@ ational Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the Nar@@ c@@ ess@@ sm of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic differences . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to a withdrawal - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in particular , to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste more political capital , they also have mis@@ au@@ tious voters - to make concessions to the British , if all this can be useless ? &quot;
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded at the start of Monday which became the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 individuals , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who join the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) connect Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ising the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e cigarettes used .
&quot; p@@ he published the &quot; Mani@@ fes@@ to report &quot; &quot; in the last month and describes him as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data , and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial written in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month has reached the &quot; &quot; very win@@ dy foundation , &quot; &quot; on which p@@ he founded its most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers are writing in BM@@ J and have asked if the asser@@ tions can build on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Works Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Pharmac@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the proof of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are based on less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ based analysis ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria / Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to create their opinions about the damage of various nicotine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting named Euro@@ Swiss Health was , whose CEO had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to the Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not financing that he has received according to reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but includes several known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also specify a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part the tobacco treatment of p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; tough evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; alleg@@ ations of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes should serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well@@ being at p@@ he said that BM@@ I was previously responded to the asser@@ tions of BM@@ G . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are considerably less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest@@ ing that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; p@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is evidence and what is not , especially when there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers down to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 8@@ 0.000 people annually die of a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking the national health system costs two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by releasing current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking occurs , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ on , says former Chief of Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should be used only to make the kind of programmes sent not through other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC suggest@@ ing that they are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , into hard controversial time tones against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he was tried for six years in his time with channel 4 without success to get into contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or sends , which would also clearly be shown from not subsidi@@ zed pra@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the top @-@ main communication Committee within its investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the radio fee , what I consider a good idea in the medium or long term , one should at least add your production to programs that others do not or will be commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice for a prime time window , because they want to reach as widespread support to their future as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax program has been financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on &apos;s is another , admittedly both original re@@ productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for that . &quot;
&quot; I am trying to see how it should be public , public television . &quot;
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame for reviews according to the ambitions of people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows from the BBC show that again , what the former manager of Sky , Tony Ball , presented in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows should sell as the East@@ on &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal N@@ ischen programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they perform their tasks and they argue if they argue for their virtual missions for justification of 4 billion pounds , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
&quot; they put them in a window window , in which no one wanted to see it ever . &quot;
&quot; for Rund@@ funk@@ y , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions that may get the best value . &quot;
&quot; of course , think of all , think that one gets a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for those who are worth £ 150 a lot of money , ask me if this is true , as they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ riders and Channel 5 @-@ Chief Technical El@@ stein , who also declared Tuesday to the Committee on Tuesday that the BBC checks its mat@@ th@@ ian mission to provide and maintain , and to entertain . &quot;
he said only little about the BBC @-@ production would now officially be classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform and conduct . &quot;
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful can be shown on TV , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ son@@ o@@ gram &apos; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ o@@ des change the direction at the moment when it sounds with sound impulses . &quot;
scientists have cultivated wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by breaks of sound @-@ waves .
&quot; tiny Nem@@ o@@ des change the direction at the moment when they reson@@ ant with sound lenses , which are too high for human hearing , to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
impulses are working through the switching of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
further refer to this topic : researchers reading and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called son@@ o@@ gram , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a range of brain , heart and muscle cells beyond the body . &quot;
&quot; S@@ re@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the ent@@ ra@@ de brain application , an invasive procedure that provides electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; re@@ treats usually do not react in ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani presented that they did when they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , that enter the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound @-@ waves tend to be called the structures that TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ onic @-@ channels are called and found in the membran@@ es by some of the lit@@ ur@@ cells .
&quot; sound waves make the opening of these channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultras@@ ound det@@ ectable Nem@@ o@@ des , changed Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ h @-@ driven TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels carry . &quot;
&quot; when it ultras@@ ound dedicated to the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ blo@@ wers and transferred into the wor@@ ms where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has a few similarities with op@@ to@@ grams , a trail @-@ breaking tool , which enables scientists to turn off neur@@ ons with stimul@@ i of light and . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that son@@ o@@ dy might have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light that has to be sent to the desired location in the brain needed in an optical fiber , light @-@ frequency micro@@ waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent in the brain from on top of the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the stressed human neur@@ ons become temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications might concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for the lives of students
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ for@@ got@@ hic 19 @-@ year @-@ old to a student residence , still with faith in Berlin and mor@@ Rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense s@@ iles of those I was angry - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the seat of the student residence ranges from easily nerve @-@ wr@@ acking until absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to v@@ ase : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where you get , whether and where you have been Sab@@ bat@@ year , where you &apos;re in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re honest Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor h@@ assen , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it is just a yeast and ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
inhal@@ e through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even when your eyelashes were shot on fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people happen .
&quot; people often turn into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting places but they are also places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
following : do not remember to start the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student population form a space @-@ to @-@ room @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can live friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
hell could be hell for someone who seeks to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship goes further , but you have to go away , so that I get my energy back , which I have used for inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a class@@ mates are exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of knock . &quot;
apro@@ pos and car@@ p : do it .
&quot; a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship with b@@ aking .
&quot; when you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of browsers , less wei@@ rd as the welcome the 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I have something baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; hi @-@ made treats , is a good way to make friend@@ ships . &quot;
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends if you are a decent bak@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; mixed lot of fat from flour , sugar and fat make people feel sle@@ ep@@ y when you drop . &quot;
to ste@@ al the food is a most @-@ end crime in student population .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a rob@@ bery , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check that with the dairy owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say , even when they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when anyone ste@@ als your things , the annoying seen , and you have my compassion - but try to cope with that well @-@ balanced as my room@@ mate , who added to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise which stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent human being , but that you belong to the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b to man , who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , if they &apos;re doing something to turn Drum &amp; Bass somewhat qui@@ eter , because there was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with still loud music .
&quot; when she finally got up at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly took her neighbors to sleep with another two hours before she finished her own music and set off her door and went in to its three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would be random@@ ly in the same student residence ?
&quot; vice versa , it would not be deep embarrassing for you to keep a room@@ mate for your future marriage partnership , then they will be able to separate themselves and then experience them every day and maybe witness , how they all pull together the common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , please try to talk at least to share a little reason at least . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that somebody has left his keys in his / closed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and bullying are fine when it seems . &quot;
&quot; good argument is fun , but it only takes moments when it is worth to bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by hiding an valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but you never scan someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; connect your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but burn her possessions on the blan@@ ket not more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terrac@@ ed houses for refugees , all@@ u@@ ck@@ ling , s@@ ling thi@@ ck@@ ener &quot;
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner is building in the Middle @-@ owned Eck@@ ental Town@@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; for example , about refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need head@@ room , but also the forced mother and the scent @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to develop cheap and well still today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
&quot; entrepren@@ eur Markus G@@ ild@@ ner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds on a project shel@@ ters for refugees . &quot;
&quot; Mr G@@ ild@@ ner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : the mass accommodation in containers or turn@@ around does not have any sustainability .
because people stay in great part here .
&quot; in the face of the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very different , three @-@ storey house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house need the least place .
it makes the integration .
that is different when you get people in dormit@@ blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built exactly in the pilot project consists of three housing units , for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees are saying it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily modified according to the needs of the respective needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house tot@@ aled to 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is quite man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took part .
this is reasonable .
have the construction limits have their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : I legally en@@ listed my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the dro@@ pping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ y special construction and the space @-@ regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it will still be under construction , which creates three apartments in a town@@ house , needs at least three locations . &quot;
only in cities do the place have space for that .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their house @-@ house project ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those , who took me forward , luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not wrong .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested if you go to the setting app , click &quot; General , &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then install . &quot;
some are encountered after installation to problems as they get an error message that transm@@ its the &quot; software update has failed .
&quot; b@@ ypass the problem , users will be advised to either wait until the rush takes back or trying to update via iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; that may possibly mean the delete of apps to create space - but Apple has done that through the tigh@@ tening of the updates more likely . also , it will be easier to delete this through the prescription of the updates and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is complete . &quot;
&quot; it is worth to make sure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple does not admit that the update will be continued as the phone could possibly follow @-@ up ways and could result in a breaking @-@ off of the update . &quot;

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the field and invested 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice by Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ genesis .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ t@@ litter de@@ meister tells Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist by Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ ff mayor Hein@@ gen Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand has luck : there , Dr. Frank Müller on October 1 , will take over the practice division . &quot;
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen noted in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing there for her successor over the next few months . &quot;
&quot; following a restruc@@ tured , Müller opens the practice on 12th October until then it is invested 3@@ 10000 Euros in the premises on the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympathy was sympathy at first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who at present completed their technical academic education in the phil@@ anthrop@@ ic hospital and also wants to get into practice at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well in this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was come , I simply called them up . &quot;
&quot; married couple Müller , the idea came to operate own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf on the future . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to get to know each other about the years , and we like to accompany the families throughout the years . &quot;
&quot; as a benefit , he will soon be his own boss . &quot;
and so one re@@ alises ... the Mü@@ llers purchased the house with the practice .
you will continue to live in Bru@@ x@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the double family @-@ selling artist Frank Müller also grew up , his medicine tuition in Hannover followed positions in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is served as a senior atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , he was appointed head specialist in the district of Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is actively engaged in the DRC &apos;s readiness for Bru@@ ch@@ hausen . &quot;

&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both interference , want to break down as house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the reconstruction the rooms are modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ roll @-@ EK@@ GS and need a talk @-@ room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
a grant from a total of 50@@ 000 Euro for the Mü@@ llers in the context of a funding programme from the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; this shows how proud and happy , we are , that the practice will be continued , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ litter de@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Mu@@ eller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients coming to the practice Fel@@ genesis , in the German average practice , there are about 500 patients . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side effect of the practic@@ ality by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ low@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if there was no successor found it would have gone .
&quot; with the Mü@@ llers period , he continues to look mainly in familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power of the fields . &quot;
&quot; with their farewell we end in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have been doing there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; Liter@@ ature Fel@@ ing gh@@ ausen noted . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness noticeable her after the long time already .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will still often see , &quot; says the in@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
your man comple@@ ments l@@ ach@@ end : &quot; we have a 6,000 square @-@ square plot . &quot;
&quot; so far , I have always pushed myself before gardening , now that could be different . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls will also be high on our border , &quot; said Interior Minister in Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
controls at the Hungarian border remain upright .
&quot; clearly , it is clear that anyone who wants to make a asylum application can also be &quot; granted . &quot; &quot;
the provision of and security of the people is at the forefront .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it clearly needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the prime minister . &quot;
people must know that we don &apos;t accept infinite migration flows but not over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced , also to travel overseas for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and can also establish cor@@ ridors for the refugees under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; however , this was not the position of Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ ll@@ n in Lai@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; cor@@ ridors &quot; concept was absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is going to intensify the surveillance of the border - particularly Hungary - to intensify . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is restricted to the borders of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians in it does not want to meet its borders for refugees but not in stone . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill his obligations , otherwise the system may not work , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government shared , the first refugees had already tried during the evening hours on Tuesday , in East Croatian at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to ev@@ ade the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack them in the near areas .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , there has been a constant military vehicle with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also b@@ ail@@ ers and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; over the coming days , his country with some 4,000 refugees said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; also Bus@@ es from Pres@@ evo to the Maced@@ onian Border , who had previously made migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia reported , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade was taking place that she is trying to sort out certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want this , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to media report , in the morning , a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b @-@ border town of Si@@ d , in the course of the day , further buses expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were about 500 kilometres away throughout the night of the Maced@@ onian border in Serbia .
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has made , so the police declared to us that we are to go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; you were planning to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually be actually used to follow the current Balkan mountain route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia to a somewhat further west . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister , O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic , had in mind that his country had prepared for the fall of a strong de@@ hydr@@ ation of refugees and plans for possible down@@ conditions . &quot;
&quot; he did not call it , but he pointed out that Croatia delivered as non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control . &quot; &quot;
they conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia belongs to this since 2007 , since then , the EU partners introduce a good witness to the country as regards the standards of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ b@@ link side , behind the Hungarian border fence we continue to be around 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media report , they would have spent the last night at the boar@@ der crossing , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transi@@ tions are to be put @-@ off and b@@ aking Bre@@ g continues to be completely blocked . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic gave an appointment to calm on a local area in horror . he has the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature . &quot;
it would not be a very high refugee numbers .
&quot; one could not say whether she would continue her journey on Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers on migrants too - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute the maps on which alternative routes by Croatia are shown . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there is still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not sp@@ min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of min@@ e@@ ders was sent into the border region .

&quot; people do their worries , in part quick side@@ ways , and partially rest@@ ling . &quot;
you are heading for the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
tr@@ ams hold .
&quot; puls@@ ating , jumping all life at stunning autumn sun panel and middle abs four large panels each with the heading &quot; Be@@ fore I am dying &quot; .... &quot;
&quot; ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers made public awareness with this action on her 20 @-@ year anniversary , and is at all confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it is about life , so we went through action in the midst of the city and went to the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the manager of ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers is just as important for questions and conversations , as well as volunteers . &quot;
&quot; while some a Pass@@ ant attacks the chal@@ k and took the sentence in &quot; &quot; dreamed &quot; , &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not long , &quot; continue reading , say , say , as &quot; &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then proceed . &quot;
&quot; again and again , on the ver@@ ge of little discussions of the action they develop about life , dealing with the dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is just ahead of time .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of the world comes , I can live responsible , &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onian plant Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ combined carrier of ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ it@@ iz@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , that everyone should not inform themselves openly on the tablets , but it is understandable , finally it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and dying is still frau@@ dul@@ ent with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , even though the Hosp@@ ice movement in recent years has helped a lot to open up . &quot;
a view is received by Angel@@ ika &apos;s Go@@ j@@ roid .
the death and funeral of the funeral is one of the busi@@ est employees in the first hour .
&quot; by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers sought for volunteers , she immediately reported it and was with the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ j@@ roid is one of 45 volunteers , 43 women and two men - the interested person concerned and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and the hosp@@ ice in the hosp@@ ice . &quot;
all are they carefully trained .
Jo@@ chem Go@@ def@@ endant is able to cope well with her job and experience experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ te , stop it for precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers is free of charge and denomin@@ ational .
&quot; the financial support of the insurance and donations of relatives and associations enable the training , as well as further training and super@@ visions of ster@@ ling and funeral . &quot;
every two years training is offered for new employees .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Luther@@ an Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; again , other personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result Mi@@ xed &amp; Finance @-@ prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ continued results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer &apos;s gi@@ ants lowered his profit on an entire year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his training services .
&quot; the company also said that she intends to hire about 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this point last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to adjust pitch workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share came over 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than at the earlier pre@@ diction . &quot;
analy@@ st expecting a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view is despite the increase in price increase , aver@@ aging about 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , despite higher rainf@@ all on bo@@ ding sp@@ las@@ ers of heavy and large packages which are collected since November . &quot;
&quot; said the Company nonetheless , that it would expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company receives &quot; solid savings , &quot; if one draws the weaker than expected economic conditions , mainly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holidays employment were announced a day later than the &quot; &quot; rival U@@ PS , &quot; which is planning to stop 9@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional man@@ power , roughly the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million sold more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share amoun@@ ted to 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks investment research analy@@ st analysts said . &quot;
its sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion euros .
six of Z@@ acks asked analy@@ st 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has won a decline in international pri@@ on shipping during recent years to st@@ agn@@ ate sales in its unit express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter climbed the sales at Bod@@ h@@ sport around 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
the Express Unit recorded higher earnings based on higher rates while the earnings for higher labour costs declined in the freight market .
&quot; pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ shares per 3.@@ 85 million , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most expected meeting held in Federal Reserve C@@ ate@@ gen , spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras &apos; cas@@ ket at table to decide whether it is time for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; dor@@ man@@ t on them at one end of the finished , two @-@ story pur@@ ses , located a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
&quot; the central bank has a double order of Congress : maximize state employment , and prices keep here stable . &quot;
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged it is an un@@ closed @-@ third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; this third mandate might be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . there will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be ro@@ ast@@ ed by the unprecedented level of interest since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; though most of the data of the economy show that it grows more solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on global financial markets make that already more cautious F@@ ed @-@ representatives are anxious to increase these volati@@ lity by raising its interest rate for federal government - and if it is only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation will be primarily the most important thing you observe &quot; &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , leader econom@@ ist in the Mak@@ ler@@ Chrysler He@@ el Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not raise the interest rate , the increased insecurity on the global market enough right to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do is doing the financial market in@@ secur@@ es itself .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Bloomberg , have predicted that week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets expect a dismantling of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only one 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow by promising a further increase . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Inclu@@ sive at 22@@ 8,@@ 89 points or about 1,4 % at 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations , that the F@@ ed @-@ policy carries the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ sky , leader of the Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do so , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic at panic . &quot;
other experts argued that a tax raise will appe@@ ase the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of the mon@@ ary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , despite the liber@@ als of liber@@ als that would require more economic progress to increase the state of affairs . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs will slow@@ down in August , improving on the labour market this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate sank to 5.4 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage rigi@@ dity have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation continued continually under the end of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed @-@ representatives said that the main reason is the temporary impact of considerably lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension on the labor market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , leader of the Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets around the world ended last month , after China had em@@ itted its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Inclu@@ sive was star@@ ved in May by more than 16 % below its top stood , as investors feared that a slow @-@ down of Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ ten global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market is recovered for this month , with the Dow now at nearly 10 % below the high place of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al impacts the complex calculation and the ability to increase interest . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy has not been in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ lin@@ ers , Senior Research Fel@@ low said the U@@ CL@@ A C@@ at Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
he says that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better on the handle .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the US economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ lin@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the F@@ ed &apos;s principal , so it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank in recent years was enormous .
&quot; the mere note of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow expansion &quot; &quot; could be per@@ ple@@ ted all around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , can be undertaken by the F@@ ed representatives , that they will not only monitor the developments in another place , but also with other central banks and experts to provide a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; this decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; commented Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey Fel@@ pper , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements , which apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; viol@@ a , co @-@ fle@@ dged member of the Federal Open Market Committee , stands up for a raise , cited decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its leadership interest in three sessions , despite limiting re@@ perc@@ ussions for growth in the U.S. , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ representatives did not return these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability just during a severe crisis just like the &quot; &quot; unification of Europe &quot; , &quot; said Adam Ker@@ poses , former member of the Committee on the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the youngest turbul@@ ences are not coming to this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly wants to not get into the situation where they are raising fear of a tax people , because the markets turn off , &quot; said Posen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act continues to give the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that it would hurry ahead . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ dro@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees leave this day in Germany .
without getting a warm welcome you will not work without the work of innumerable volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ dro@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people seeking to support an un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city .
among them includes Petra and Klaus H@@ ein .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
even with their 74 L@@ enses they are still taught .
&quot; every Thursday she does in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger street . &quot;
&quot; she also helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , the Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another teaching in a real school . &quot;
Brazi@@ li@@ ens pedi@@ atric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS attempts to clear women on how important good diet is during the lac@@ tation period . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted at breasts , which are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are coming to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by some 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only diagnostic tool , the mothers should do so . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that healthy nutrition fluctu@@ ate women actually affects the genes of their babies and it protects them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can have the immune system negative . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ smells of the sports hall
&quot; the Municipal Council authorized the construction contract for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall . &quot;
and he made an exception .
the roof must become fl@@ atter for solar generators .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited rotation of the amber area arrive at the amber workshop step by step , in the most recent council meeting , the design contract had been am@@ bled without great discussions . &quot;
&quot; the body had previously agreed on such an application for a &quot; &quot; respect &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion of the current construction plan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the construction construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof must be established with non @-@ imp@@ aired First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof covering for solar generators : &quot; this is how we get a wonderful little South @-@ dd@@ ach , &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in his meeting . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; liberation &quot; this , in turn , the roof bow , that consists of energetic reasons - other than in the development plan , is to lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; liberation &quot; was thus needed , because the development plan relating to the roof bow does not permit &quot; exceptions &quot; - however , the Bern@@ rie@@ der Con@@ feder@@ ate in general tend to be more restric@@ tive in the rule of liberation . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the proposal is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the turn@@ around at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots sports performance .
&quot; in the next step of the procedure , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metres large hall is now included for the check . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is introduced to the Hospital Manager of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 66 ) . &quot;
the station as well as the majority of the staff draw from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg with the direction Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these were seen the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county where Land@@ s@@ cent@@ ed Andrea has confirmed the governor @-@ and @-@ white .
&quot; a decision to the board though the Supervisory Board , and the conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are to be put into action , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be working at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move with fishermen and of further existing inside to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; co @-@ workers who cannot be offered with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , while Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees are kept informed of their plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , the exchange of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who is only since the beginning of the appointment of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to his question about who the succession is up , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; took over , as he began to take over the direction of 1 October and to move with his team to Hol@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au hin@@ ders this in any case a &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offering in &quot; internal medicine , &quot; as the artist @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ acing and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; over the next two years , fishermen would agree with his team if the supervisory board dis@@ agrees with its team , until then next year the former Hospital of Kn@@ app@@ es , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; previously , the county @-@ circle had planned this for 2018 , as the current expansion was completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital . &quot;
&quot; Dr who advis@@ es Jo@@ in @-@ White , who is also president of the Supervisory Board , having counter@@ ed rum@@ ors to be engaged in possession of the Bundes@@ rat , in the future as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the end I close . as it goes on with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ White cannot say , there will give several considerations . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ ch@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric .
&quot; what re@@ funds could not happen to us , such an occasion comes not coming again , &quot; &quot; as Fischer over the Qu@@ asi @-@ Moving to the Le@@ ch , which had been received by the employees &quot; positively and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where fishermen have worked as a leader doctor for over 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to assume the position of the physician Director .
&quot; in recent decades the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was once again threatened by conclu@@ ding , agencies were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ hel@@ m of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions have been called in the Berg@@ isches HC this evening ( 20 : 15 ) .

&quot; at the beginning there were the 20 @-@ year @-@ old , the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a non @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a victim to violence perpetr@@ ated in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; the cor@@ pse of young woman was reported at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , like pro@@ secutor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a suppor@@ ter of 20 @-@ year @-@ old , one also goes to pass the promot@@ er 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who is indeed obtaining the statement , and investig@@ ates the investig@@ ators for the locality of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after it was not agreed on the eve after a autumn visit in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators look into personal belon@@ gings of the victim .

refugees need accommodation : study warns in front of apartment
the location on the German housing market is tense .
&quot; again , more and more refugees are seeking affordable lead . &quot;
printing on the housing market is growing .
the social housing is ahead of a challenge .
department of department of the German housing market have long since started .
&quot; with the incoming refugees and unemployed people from the EU more and more people push for a market , already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
it is competing with commen@@ dable citizens around the last paid apartments .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , up to 2020 , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
a study aims at the Commission of the &quot; Progressive Alliance &quot; of social housing .
&quot; the comparison : this year , 26@@ 0,000 units will be finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this is not missing 14@@ ,000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first week . &quot;
many come across the apartment market and stand in the long sn@@ akes in front of the rented apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Office of statistics , less than half of all asylum seekers have lived for rent in the last year . &quot;
however the negative trend in the housing market is not only aimed at the increasing amount of refugees .
the study also makes considerable ens@@ om@@ issions in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany sho@@ ve a residential deficit that will grow bigger from year to year .
&quot; we were already missing in the metropolitan areas around 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professional work places therefore lived in large cities W@@ apped in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed longer for the F@@ at in the apartment market un@@ inten@@ tionally longer at &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capita in the past years has declined . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the union &quot; &quot; social housing &quot; &quot; is propos@@ ing a new &apos; Rel@@ aunching Europe &apos; . &quot;
this aims to boost new incentives in social housing development again .
&quot; thus , the land tax could be avoided and the fundamental tax for funded apartments will be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the alliance offers attractive tax @-@ de@@ preci@@ ation options . &quot;
the promotion programme for the refugee population of the E@@ tru@@ er Kf@@ W is now well connected with towns and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , a total of around 300 million euros was called on Monday evening , with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free funds : Croatia and Slovenia to corridor an
&quot; to Hungary , there is practically no investment coming to Hungary and more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that you allow transit through Slovenia to North without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia over the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and has already been incorporated into the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia has not been a Schengen country .
&quot; after the break @-@ off of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees arrive to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people had reached the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik on the Croatian postal channel RT@@ L .
Hungary had sail@@ ed its border to refugees on Monday .
&quot; laws that came into force the same day , taking into account the decent asylum procedure in Hungary practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to make the refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police had captured the first refugees at the Serbia &apos;s border in Serbia on the morning .
&quot; most of them are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after her arrival , she would have been trying to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
at the Croatian @-@ Turkish border the refugees encounter not f@@ ences at the border .
&quot; that is the border stri@@ pe other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
M@@ min@@ e@@ fields are now to quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border there is no longer refugees leaving the border .
on Tuesday the police were occupied by the 3@@ 66 people .
shortly before Tor@@ p on Monday it had not been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws make the overthrow and damage of the border with us as criminal off@@ ences .
&quot; thus , in the south@@ western border town of Sz@@ eged , only 35 criminal proceedings were initiated . &quot;
the susp@@ ens@@ ory pen@@ alties of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration office , on Tuesday that the &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; took place in the newly furnished &quot; tran@@ ons &quot; of 94 refugees , almost all of them - 93 - died on the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
there were still 40 refugees on the we@@ d@@ nesday morning .
&quot; however , nobody has had a view to seek asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third @-@ land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the past measures on asylum seekers should be ported straight from the top .
&quot; in front of the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
workers began to stir in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; they gathered the garbage , one of which left thousands of people over the last few weeks at the road@@ side . &quot;
pl@@ y@@ sti@@ ff were disman@@ tled and one of the asc@@ ending races in the border area was rebuilt .
&quot; to the goal of this kind , no one wanted to express themselves . &quot;
Austria is close to the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around the 20.000 migrants were to remain in government , but still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuing journey to Germany .
&quot; in the morning of migration from there to Germany , the morning was stopped by the German authorities in the morning . &quot;
in liberty we regularly meet smaller groups of refugees .
Mayor was passing by the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge on Sunday with the super@@ structure , when suddenly there were ten people with rice off@@ sho@@ oters at the entrance of the tent , &quot; so W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alois Kas@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to go to Pass@@ au by train .
&quot; because Germany had caught the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , she was immediately blown away for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , so he immediately offered his help and sho@@ ch@@ ised the cars on the border into the river N@@ ahe . &quot;
&quot; before , we did not first mo@@ urn the un@@ hoped for guests , with snacks and drinks . &quot;
we immediately said we take her by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was something for us of course , &quot; &quot; so pul@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very thankful .
&quot; one man did not let him take to commit a generous donation , 100 Euro for the fire@@ fighters . &quot;
&quot; he was very happy &quot; , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the sho@@ vel sho@@ wr@@ ists were on Sunday evenings in Wels by a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au to make it res@@ sed after the short @-@ term notice , that the railway traffic was set to Germany but still trying to try the border . &quot;
the regional train was stopped shortly before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors in the Sunday soci@@ ably , Mon@@ days ago a bi@@ pr@@ er@@ un athle@@ tic - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is being sent thousands of others , tens of thousands of us , is a logical result of this hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than at the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the formation of structures which human@@ ly guarantee humanity , our Chancellor has officially lifted up and publicly proclaimed the position of the Hungarian Government in the bor@@ der@@ land of National Socialism . &quot;
Lei@@ d@@ tra@@ den@@ sing of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced in the border @-@ areas with chaotic states .
&quot; the refugees must also discover that the &quot; &quot; landed country , &quot; &quot; that she invited and welcomed , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flow and the nearby winter , with us to produce decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be one even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

the chaos in the first order centre &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen &quot; had already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ iz@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday - be out of great turmoil , reveals Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; mastery . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior , in contrast , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ in situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Con@@ rad expects a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ave year . &quot;
&quot; for the number to meet , more than 3@@ 5.000 accommodation will have to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 should the countries deploy , 15,000 by the federal government . &quot;
should there be more refugees then we can make it happen .
&quot; but it is not a wh@@ ass without the ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
with the state @-@ cent@@ uri@@ ons he has already held conversations .
&quot; this would have promised him for the future refugees , as well as for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Al@@ atar is supported by Con@@ rad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born , to be rejected as the Church is going to help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations puts the asylum coordinator at the OR@@ F &quot; helping &quot; hel@@ mets , like we do . &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodations .
tourists are also hoping to have a lot of hotels listed in the winter .
Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &apos; very high .
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ or must respect a certain height of the hand @-@ holder or the size of the over@@ lap . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary time , &quot; single standards &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; he was distinguished by his experience as opposed to the Interior Ministry , &quot; &quot; concluded Konrad with his Experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , who can not be in the face of the truth without further notice . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
&quot; finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs , as they themselves explained . &quot;
your number of employees want to increase it to three to four .
the own advertisement @-@ search has not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but apparently there are problems with the permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
first no opening of city sports centres and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accommodate refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as one could manage the person currently without these measures , Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) says . &quot;
&quot; for emergen@@ cies , additional locations should be checked for their vi@@ ability . &quot;
critic@@ isms of the mayor in the distribution of refugees within the Federal Republic of Germany .
other districts must be part of this post .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer call by the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the main estate Josef P@@ â@@ inger ( VP ) established the further course of the refugee question .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that German borders will not be closed off .
the continued trip of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany will continue to be possible .
but there are now the corresponding limits controls .
special relations with refugees arrive to Germany will not take place in the first place .
&quot; however , the refu@@ elling would however bring with regular trains to Germany . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the other EU member states , P@@ iss@@ inger once again asked for greater solidarity in the question of refugees . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria is conducting on its boundaries once again , is for P@@ iss@@ inger &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the General@@ ate of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building is the listed IT &amp; T Group headquarters , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is said to be rented to young , innovative companies from the field of technology . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T Chief Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
it could imagine to invest in Star@@ tup company of the New Wer@@ ft and later to which to acquire .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which l@@ haus@@ er promises some things : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is only a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T in the RU@@ D &apos;s site , one third of the city of Linz , the region of Upper Austria , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square meters in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ writer opened second shop in the Arctic
in the new shop Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are in the center .
actually Jut@@ ta wanted to add a dog to Jut@@ ta .
&quot; this project had to put the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ itation by Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ber @-@ Ark@@ le shor@@ th@@ and in@@ lay : after all , it has now got an increase in the form of a new business area . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , in which they sell among others bags , cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around the Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories are up to 500 euros .
from yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; but I did a long time out if I was to open a shop , &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a very own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in the Greater Region Linz , that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots . &quot;
your fashion interest has been wide from her mother in the cradle .
&quot; to me most , if something developed and I can show new trends at an offer . &quot;
why so many women in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tin @-@ si@@ ties and the expert can &apos;t be answered with last certainty .
perhaps it is because a beautiful bag is used every out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ aff@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called a@@ geber . &quot;
this property is also connecting with the billi@@ on@@ aire that wants to become the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for Ex@@ c@@ ab .
&quot; whether it is alien@@ ated expressing xen@@ ophobia , journalists &apos; associations or inqu@@ si@@ ties in the international crisis policy - the aspir@@ ants for the US presidential election will be vigor@@ ated to the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts out well with it .
&quot; it is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents contained the &quot; &quot; property of the real @-@ metre @-@ milli@@ ard &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the New Yorker with the F@@ öhn@@ h@@ ur is one of the Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some of the 1200 inhabitants village is above -@@ tens of corners with it is related .
&quot; his grandfather came out of K@@ all@@ stadt in Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in electoral campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ ot@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del filmed a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villagers have to become their aim to become the mi@@ gh@@ est man in the world ?
&quot; I think that somehow they find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their much later , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native sound of the city has a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous war@@ locks , among which along to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ city &quot; ( 2014 ) also word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful even if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
but he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; indeed , I give respect for the performance of the family , but also bi@@ ased the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit a big har@@ l , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; reasonably called the nickname , the K@@ all@@ city in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - about high @-@ German : the gi@@ ver , says them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the geber .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and in the US opened a pub for Gold@@ dig@@ ger . &quot;
found@@ ational of the real estate company were the first plot of property in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free of education : her wish to return to the homeland over time , failed in the Bav@@ arian State , to which the Palat@@ inate was founded at that time . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t have absorbed Tr@@ ump because he once had been written without permission , he had director of the Institute for pf@@ alz History and Folklore , Roland Paul , to the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this contrast seems to the sometimes striking evidence of the l@@ ull .
&quot; he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US , asking the building of a boundary wall to prevent illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the pol@@ ath@@ ist that is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant m@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers in retirement will see the Americans rather detached , &quot; &quot; he is always so sh@@ be@@ ed . &quot;
does he reti@@ cles from all ?
&quot; I cannot imagine it , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never dealt with cooking . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ f Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as some kit@@ ers , that a desc@@ endant of the Family Heinz with a visit to something for the church &apos;s rule , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; this can &apos;t I say of the Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they are better if he did not know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I do not know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who were in the US for the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like he , &quot; he would never have arrived at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Kr@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not yes , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , being inter@@ viewed for the ump long inter@@ viewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ lon@@ ers , even in the US awake the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bav@@ arian community Ram@@ sau am Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; Berg@@ sti@@ ger@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; the Vice @-@ President of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , received the 1800 inhabitants village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den on Wednesday the award for soft tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ eering villages .
in the neighboring country there is the local alpine club for the award of the award .
a &quot; Berg@@ sti@@ ger@@ dorf &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of his surface must be designated as a shelter .
Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of Nine , the loss of leadership in the Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stefan ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son came to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report after the loss of the liber@@ als of the Liber@@ als , but it did not show great shifts on the trends for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine has been shown from the federal capital city hall as Mal@@ col@@ m @-@ bull managed the down@@ fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ days , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television programs , to which also Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back of the board seemed to not play a role for Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise reached an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators with the five main cities compared to today 3@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in the rate of ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and the last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind that of the last Thursday ( 34@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last few months today looked into the gap to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 40,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; so far in September , Sun@@ rise stands with average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today . &quot;
that is the most interest that happ@@ end every morning .
the winds of change involve these morning workers more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seriousness of his church Robert Thom@@ son Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in with his two children at the New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son couldn &apos;t carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &apos; Yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven has strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 until 17.@@ 30 ) the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos; Ke@@ e@@ fe earned average 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia had 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will also be confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately be able to enforce about 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars which un@@ managed not to over@@ load the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three of them agreed : Bachelor &apos;s Sam is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons mountains , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly apparently , who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood held in The Bachelor finally , was wrapped in greatest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will surely not reveal whether to choose the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; however , as we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three , you possibly accidentally put a note on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips to the finals on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have ignored ly@@ rical way about why wood is the perfect man and under@@ mine his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive outlook as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to receive Woods last rose ? &quot; &quot; could give her answers to the game @-@ per@@ k who won the heart of the bed . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki added both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner in wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies van@@ ished , that felt they were pretty compatible and I have thought that throughout the whole show , &quot; &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks that she and Sam Wood been particularly suitable as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house@@ visit last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; the one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now subject to myself , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , to elect Wood , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on top ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after having moved to the USA - and there were many other teams working at the end of last year &apos;s impressive training day .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise decision .
some coach would have ban@@ ished to the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a bar@@ angel as it lost a bar@@ angel as it did the Aussie Millions League in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave me the next opportunity to return an Pun@@ t return , and also to the running game after an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continues to show its true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding its ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team by the mill and encouraged them .
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula was strengthened after the play public in his press conference , also publicly in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sports @-@ porter In@@ one reported that Hay@@ ne was encouraged by team @-@ team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ et him to forget his playful catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ad@@ d Hay@@ es patented in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first slot of the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian ge@@ fol@@ g@@ ship had hoped for his N@@ FL re@@ debut . &quot;
Hay@@ es left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ff and later he told the Australian radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could barely imagine a bad start in his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; Hay@@ es said . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne exp@@ elled the car@@ ver with its Orig@@ in debut in 2007 in 2007 , when a pass was conducted at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area at a T@@ ry for Queensland . &quot;
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the free voters want to call for the high refugee numbers the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria .
&quot; leader of Party and leader of Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger knew about a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , in front of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns Schools for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to save the schools before a collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get gra@@ dations in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the social @-@ day survey of the free voters is conven@@ ed until Friday in the commune of the commune .
&quot; actually , all other main themes were also provided . &quot;
but the record attendance of the refugees now dominates the free voters @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course the subject of water is covered again to the cl@@ ut@@ or , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called on the establishment of United Nations zones for refugees in Syria and gave it during the Yugoslavia @-@ War in the 1990s .
&quot; so it does not go on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers let the free voters want to push off as quickly as possible .
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger also required more staff to the administration of the courts that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ drivers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards of federal states .
&quot; Bavaria stops , others do not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more resili@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; but the national policies in the W@@ allo@@ on city shall not fall under the table . &quot;

but this goes not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of freedom for all gymn@@ as@@ tics who want this .
&quot; free run at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;
fir@@ mer Wall Street helps D@@ ax to get the jumps
the German stock market has closed over long distances to cross @-@ wide and nervous trading course with winn@@ ings .
&quot; only in the afternoon a fir@@ mer performance op@@ ener off the US @-@ agate for a clear direction , that the D@@ ax ultimately won by 0.@@ 56 per cent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;

many bor@@ ehol@@ dings expect the markets to be res@@ in place until after the interest rate in the U.S. and also to the huge decline at the exchange on that Friday .
&quot; the discussion about bur@@ dens from the nuclear war has passed the shares of RW@@ E in the meantime to a record , and also left deep foot@@ steps on eon . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; Spiegel &quot; , &quot; the German energy plan would possibly be more than 30 billion Euros . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered a little , but finally lost 3,@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon Technologies has risen at the D@@ ax tip by more than 3.@@ 22 percent .
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report of the US @-@ wing magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; worked on the weekend . &quot;

4 people killed after poli@@ cem@@ an rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police rubber bul@@ lets wrapped in a quantity of people that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a be@@ amer on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke in the district R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , approximately 175 mph northwest of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading District public servant , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters gathered outside of a police station , with some of you and fire@@ bom@@ bed . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have inserted Tr@@ as@@ eng@@ a and then fired into the air before she rep@@ lied on rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the included rubber bul@@ lets , of which it is known that they are used to kill , but are traditionally used as a less deadly route , apparently produced so high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of non@@ violent protests in Nepal , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ris@@ i say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the under@@ tak@@ ers who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officials , have been in violent struggles since the decade . &quot;
&quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , divided the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled central for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution is underway since 2008 , but legisl@@ ator accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed in April thousands of people . &quot;
&quot; the makers have voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitu@@ ents in Kathmandu , and officials beli@@ ed that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction planning in the city planned
the land at the Em@@ ph@@ i @-@ center Alte Post is again to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of its 4000 square meter area .
&quot; there is a mixture of trade , commerce and accommodation - concrete offers are not yet available . &quot;
Em@@ den - the town Em@@ den wanted to market a large 4000 square meter platform in direct proximity to the youth centre of the Old Post .
the preparations for this work are underway .
&quot; the area is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for the corresponding offers , is to be seen on the part of the city . &quot;
&quot; which in@@ quired about , is not yet understood . &quot;
no contracts were signed .
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner of the street , bought several months ago and tear the building that is located . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday house at the Little Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor freely gave publicly plans for the project to be publicly available .
several dec@@ pers are more troubled - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure activities
&quot; months of year was behind closed doors , they were p@@ onder@@ ing and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday house at the Little Sea are near the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized empowerment of companies &quot; system @-@ construction , &quot; set out its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the city development committee on Monday . &quot;
that point was originally on the agenda on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , with the investors and the management of the secret agent , Ralf Fro@@ zen went from the governance model management into the offensive : &quot; we do not yet have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
however it is good to be able to deal with all rum@@ ors now .
about ten to twelve million Euros per project have been in discussion for months now .
&quot; strong responses to Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ land@@ owners who came to the meeting were breaking down the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and manager at the Adv@@ ent of An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; this becomes a huge kl@@ ot@@ z , that prot@@ ru@@ des all the other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears like many other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the system : &quot; there , all the buses come , so that it counts . &quot;
&quot; what happens precisely on the well one hect@@ are of the former Gast@@ stätte , it is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; only then do we have to be a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ens . &quot;
because this was not yet missing but the development plans were still variable .

Google starts bi@@ fur@@ ing donations in order to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL ) announced a dou@@ bling don@@ ating campaign to aid thousands of refugees trying to help thousands of refugees , as opposing the European nations as they flee from war to cr@@ acked and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the funds call on his blog .
&quot; instead of making a manager let the announcement make , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google staff who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our journey were many dark train and buses , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and anxiety &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe grew , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations are made available to four non @-@ profit organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally raised donations to a value of 5.5 million on google@@ .com / to be doubled to 11 million $ .
&quot; Europe has faced a major refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has been driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escaped from the war with Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya from the war . &quot;

&quot; for easily , overweight people can be a weight of weight surgery . &quot;
the advantages of weight losses for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study for at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to say if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer live as those that are non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , who en@@ rolled an editorial to the new study in J@@ ama Sur@@ ge@@ ons . &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity surgery are using different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the physical ability to contain food .
&quot; over the years , obesity have been proven efficiently to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that somebody is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; the researchers at Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and stomach sickness to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I , among those that were subjected to this operation , declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I was at those who won &apos;t @-@ surgical diabetes treatments practically at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who are subjected to surgical procedure , at 36 % the diabetes condition is completely and in parts indicated at 28 % . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes beha@@ ved completely only in one percent and in part in only two percent in comparison to diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were performed in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical group &quot; , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitoring the patient &apos;s blood level from hem@@ ost@@ al in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar over time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent by writing the researchers .
&quot; after an operation , the average hem@@ ost@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
in the medical treatment group there remained stable at about 8 percent .
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as you reflected in the improved tick @-@ global A@@ 1@@ c level - dimin@@ ished not the mortality rate in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also im@@ printed average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ kt@@ om@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 5.1 ) and Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3,@@ 1 % vs. 14.@@ 1 % ) and signed a complete overthrow of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; although the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery upwards , there are indications of a study of he@@ avi@@ e@@ ers in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was subjected to high @-@ fat people who are subjected to an obesity operation , about 29 per cent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no benefit for survival with the surgery , Black@@ stone , it was re@@ ass@@ uring for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 which are interested in the trial . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in the lower BM@@ I group , without elevated risk of death or kidney illness , &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone warns that people and their doctors should begin to take weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they accum@@ ulate these genetic modifications , which have connected to their bodies with obesity and diabetes . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is being held at the level of fiction : a young woman , school @-@ time un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , has come back to years the severity of her youth , and he fell in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published book &apos; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; about the love story , the novel may most likely be interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück reader , for it is playing in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main professional author is raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she could place a literary monument to her home place .
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , the Dalai Lama promised and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide called for ending violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of continuous refugee crisis in the United Kingdom in his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he requested that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admir@@ able but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s support and Austria &apos;s efforts in addressing the crisis , he stressed that there was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think over long term solutions , such as a true peace and genuine development , mainly created by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the kill@@ ings in their countries are reduced . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and presented that the U.S. violent response from the US attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after the 11th September I put my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the path to the solution of this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he placed power , and that has brought forth un@@ expected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of sof@@ tening of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ ect@@ ants for children in the past 4 years
&quot; pl@@ aster control centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent process in the number of children under twelve , which are strongly alcoholic G@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , thus Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases proceeds from revenues of to@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants for children below 12 years of age , which report the gyp@@ sum control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go out in the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said some children dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant seem to visi@@ bly drink as some people do their friends to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in social media .
videos on YouTube show how young people avoid dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly worked out dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with alcoholic beverage water to get a tougher beverage .
younger children can from attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; one child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ ted .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange strap , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in to@@ dd@@ lers can have very few injections to alcohol po@@ is@@ oned .
&quot; it is highly concentrated liqu@@ or , &quot; said Dr Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , the medical director of the po@@ ison center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in H@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let p@@ int whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and if children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lash of &quot; &quot; straw@@ berry &quot; &quot; cut @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in school was taken to a emergency . &quot;
&quot; it was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is commonly consumed at an adult law than drunk , &quot; said Dr. Chris k@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ary physician , who treated them at the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah whis@@ per her words and was not able to walk , when she came to the lap@@ se . &quot;
&quot; doctors des@@ ks her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and pulled out the head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
I could have fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ators outside the reach of the child outside the reach of the child .
over alcohol po@@ is@@ oned were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario women were killed in the lo@@ op@@ holes of the de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that have a toxicity , not de@@ ple@@ ated ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employers of health authorities assume that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , which was noted as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; Pain@@ ted &quot; teacher to po@@ isons , taking advantage of anti @-@ bacterial products around the educational space , &quot; announces it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to sag@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them from their room .
the police regarded the promised plan as &quot; ossi@@ p . &quot; and trans@@ duc@@ al measures to the school authorities .
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; for a dri@@ ve@@ way on the cross @-@ span@@ ish between the North ring and On whom , at a dri@@ ve@@ way , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car has been slightly wounded . &quot;
&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the cross @-@ panel towards the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout , and received too late that at the roundabout had two @-@ going vehicles . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he pr@@ apped with his truck in the rear of an audience and whether this vehicle had a standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the vehicles involved in the case of an Sach@@ sen@@ ess of about 10 000 Euro , the police were transferred . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer travelling and had to be to@@ wed away .

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football sho@@ ot@@ out st@@ ale - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ ang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former National player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er has told that Dutch football fans were interested in Celtic Aff@@ air there &apos;s no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the R@@ ang@@ ers .
&quot; but right now , de Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of Celtic Games any more and why ? &quot;
it is because the r@@ ang@@ ers are not there .
people not only talk about the return of the R@@ ang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there aren &apos;t just the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I am going to keep things around , tur@@ ist Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic will fight , but the Norwegian boss ceas@@ es to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent expul@@ sion from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead clearly at the head of the table . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ à said , &quot; Celtic had a bad times before , and we will return . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel this is exactly the same thing - but we need to continue .
&quot; we really need Celtic Aff@@ air &apos;s support , because that makes the players better . &quot;
to sit down is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK the overall growth is increasing .
&quot; in the period from May to July , unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole decreased by 10,000 EUR 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate was about 5.@@ 9 per cent higher than that of the Ukrain from 5.5 per cent , as demonstrated by the figures of the office for National statistics ( ONS ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment fell to 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland was declined at 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ o commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
&quot; it is almost exactly a year ago , Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK . &quot;
&quot; over these 12 months , we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market , with a rising level of employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I become a witness in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; a bit later today , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is being put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip is executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made first in January with his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day came closer , I started to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell a whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see references in the U.S. , and as often more applications are available as seats , a flawless lottery took place to decide who is selected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
who is chosen will be an em@@ otive observe .
I cannot do it .
&quot; besides Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s strange friend , I will sit with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telep@@ hon@@ y and a two and a half hours . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to not@@ ch a notebook and a pen , to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try and remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving me my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you will get access . &quot;
I am privileged to be with you .
&quot; they sp@@ ies that &quot; &quot; it could have been better able to form@@ ulate &quot; , &quot; but it still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problems with some of the things that I said and written .
&quot; he didn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he may remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present , to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks he will help the public relations of the movement against death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a ro@@ dent of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , is sitting next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Rompuy would be guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of the act .
yet I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence . &quot;
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can not claim to really be objective .
there will be other re@@ porter to which you can turn for .
&quot; what you get from me is , what it is said to see a man a unnecessary death to die . &quot;

&quot; an attempt of a man of Perth to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , just few meters away from a police officers , tried to return him gently to the bank . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called back on Tuesday to a domestic peace vo@@ lition result in B@@ abo@@ ham .
&quot; as she discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the p@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water@@ - and said &apos; I come not out , come and get myself , &quot; said senior Sergei S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his Uni@@ form combat , therefore it turned out a depend@@ ant tactics - &quot; &quot; a good poli@@ cem@@ an is negotiated . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people join funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Sergei Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
Master@@ pieces Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a drinking control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired natives to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter Moo@@ dy charges that Ste@@ el@@ ers tried to raise him out and threatens to end the racing sport .
&quot; Peter Moo@@ dy charges that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria have tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables , in the past year to immediately end the race at an end . &quot;
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed her personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Eng@@ ai due to a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday to go through . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he always sought to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions as it went about the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ t@@ sample of Li@@ dar@@ is , which he can &apos;t explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage alleg@@ ations , and did not want to see , &quot; &quot; I see &quot; &quot; too high hanging grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had before , nothing to say about it and I &apos;ve been eating for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything is coming out , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it is far .
&quot; people sometimes re@@ acted , and you have to live with the consequences and I must live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk up@@ to the main train , and I want my owners to think I try my best for it . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
so I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had ho@@ isted the bomb into an interview with rac@@ ing.com , for the integrity department had tried to sp@@ out his stable . &quot;
&quot; approaching eigh@@ teen months , Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will call - and offered him a pre@@ occupation in my stables , to provide information about what I do within my st@@ abling , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
apparently they believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to touch me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , acting President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ver , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this time and are still today . &quot;
&quot; should I bring myself to the view , that it is personally ? &quot;
has the R@@ V@@ L file and perhaps makes people responsible outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people remember there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they need to take my license and ch@@ ased me out , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; but I have now reached the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will exert pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustration of the trainer have set up with the long @-@ prolonged cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching did so that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s best known by its preparation of the spa@@ wn master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the full @-@ day treatment &quot; &quot; ridiculous &quot; &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse@@ power , which was opposed to the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; one of my employees has made mistak@@ enly turn to the leg . &quot;
it could have been yesterday evening so .
it could have been yesterday the whole day as it was .
it also had it that on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack of the pack . an examination of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules are nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here one has gone too far , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man for cur@@ ses arrested
in the weekend the police had transferred a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent travel spaces in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist went to hospital with heavy injury in the Royal Melbourne hospital after having been struck by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley highway .
&quot; the police tell that the driver continued , without stopping , in order to help the last driver . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia sat in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be pro@@ secuted for the cur@@ sed and cur@@ vy aid and for other transportation measures .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram stays in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y proposes against rival for alleg@@ ations of ring handle
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ am@@ y has cri@@ be criticism of the B@@ ackl@@ ing of its players as &quot; agenda &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster &apos;s Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires &quot; winner @-@ struggles &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in the qualifying session in Sydney will be allowed in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett made a little squ@@ ad@@ ored note to the Storm team , following his team performed the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland would not be &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; in the ran@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y def@@ ends the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they are focused on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; in the tr@@ amp . &quot;
Bell@@ am@@ y added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team endor@@ ses him with confident that they were worried about being beaten from the Storm .
&quot; that emerges again and again - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring @-@ fights , when she fought with us 24 : 2 , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; this year , I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques all year long . but over the last six weeks we have made our contact with Sl@@ ackl@@ es , a real emphasis for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s been wei@@ rd to see how this time to come back to that time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ am@@ y has attacked the &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and remembers its ment@@ or that Ben@@ net@@ ts St George Il@@ la@@ z@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football has won . &quot;
Way@@ ne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening , and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ am@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St. George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take a sh@@ one . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team to play , and which we can see as exciting , particularly its young players with their speed . &quot;
&quot; this is the ball game , which you want to play if you have these kinds of players . &quot;
&quot; he made that statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all of his kind of football -- not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as these . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence , because they say these things because they &apos;re a bit worried , to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was about the Big Games .
Bell@@ am@@ y also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game of Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bronze was a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not have any points of sp@@ ans ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that in a phase we will meet again upon them . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team has been free on this weekend because they have the right to receive a North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks , the next Saturday night in the final final in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales start off starting next Monday . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200.000 $ deposit to drug age
&quot; a man who could potentially threaten a life long sentence due to its account , into possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that were cut to Queensland , was released by Queensland $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police poli@@ c@@ ei 100 kg of the drug was found on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he began his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the mor@@ nings and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police had 40 kilograms of the drug in a Chinese response .
&quot; despite an apparently Li@@ felong sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer from Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that it has no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the cafe could have been an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason . &quot;
&quot; judges at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Stro@@ ak , was worried about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relationships with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he stated the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in case of trial , he admitted the police concerning his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had jointly offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security , to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the ei@@ rd explanations of these two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 Dollar is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not be enough to prevent him from being away , so he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he prints his Australian and his Ser@@ b @-@ pass , consecr@@ ated daily in the police and is at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g &apos;s phone used by girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le studied the phone of a 11 year old girl to abuse images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the girl of the girl as this slept ; log@@ out into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through thought the confusing messages and aler@@ ted immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of , and saw the five pictures , analy@@ sed then computers that were found under the address and discovered the search research on the search for an in@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g cont@@ ended with the officials that he did it , since it would lead to &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le in the internet &quot; &quot; and he then called , &quot; &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an happened to make them scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ gen@@ dh G@@ ili@@ dh Rober@@ t@@ son said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ ted to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the Search on the Computer were carried out by him , said , &quot; &quot; It should be done , because he wanted to claim , to be a poli@@ cem@@ an in order to sc@@ ort ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he was asked for his conversation with the non @-@ known person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said that he was sick in his head , when he drinks , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son said : &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on the tre@@ mble and in the we@@ eping . &quot;
she also saw the un@@ decent pictures on the telephone and made the accused .
&quot; the girl was inter@@ viewed and said , that the accused Computer and Play@@ station used to talk to girls who saw a lot younger than him . &quot;

&quot; defen@@ ders Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g was not in the register of sexual criminal offen@@ ders , as one can argue that &quot; &quot; no substantial sexual element &quot; &quot; in his going to be found . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael reveals whether judgment is expected until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g was granted for deposit in this case , however , it was held in detention due to hear@@ ings about other remaining cases . &quot;
it was admitted even before the date of the pri@@ on in the directory of sexual criminal offen@@ ders .
hau@@ user moved on small border transfer to Germany
&quot; increasingly , more and more refugees are held by the Franco @-@ Austrian border . &quot;
many hau@@ user were taken from fear of discovery and detention of men at smaller border accounts .
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man told the police force . &quot;
&quot; alongside the river bank at the border river , there were over 1,000 refugees in the districts of the &quot; &quot; Pass@@ au @-@ Inn &quot; &quot; and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
you were walking on the German side by walking and ir@@ cul@@ ation .
there they are collected by police stations in reception and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at Munich &apos;s main station , following the weekly start of the Munich station , more refugees meet for refugees in comparison to the weekly start of the weekly race on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; after 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. , some 700 people are left in the state capital , told an speaker in the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re @-@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border , the city was reached on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees . &quot;
Stuttgart : sp@@ urs of Tro@@ gh@@ ost &quot; Henry &quot; in the South@@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm dra@@ ins in the southwest of Mitt@@ al afternoon .
&quot; because of a low pressure in Western Europe , warm sea levels currently use warm sea air to the country , the German We@@ ather@@ service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart with . &quot;
&quot; the steep ump is the prec@@ urs@@ ory of the tro@@ t &quot; Henry , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic over the last few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
rough storms and t@@ witter are expected mainly in bathing .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday , there is also in the Black Forest , on the Schwä@@ bische Al@@ b and in the Lake seek@@ er with bucks of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
it is therefore no longer possible to look at the sun again on Friday .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A have their innovations .
2015 is noticeable above all on comp@@ acts for comp@@ acts that are currently being sold very well .
cars from the compact class are currently especially asked : around 2@@ 8.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations were falling according to the Federal Chancell@@ ery ( KBA ) alone in August on this segment .
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; in this year , between all the futur@@ istic conceptual vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented this year , most new compact models . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premium for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which is available in the de@@ aler@@ ships in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model , &quot; Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann promised at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume of the volume , the new A@@ stra model is to be also not supposed to be much more expensive . &quot;
Rüssel@@ sheim / Munich . Opel is presenting an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in the prospect which is starting at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the A@@ stra has a new 1 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; for the first time , Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which first to include three @-@ cylinder petrol engine . &quot;
unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus there are Opel A@@ stra .
&quot; a second version will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is already visible on the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will the A@@ stra have stopped at the IA@@ A in new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competitors Mé@@ gan@@ e &apos;s competition .
on the exhibition the Mé@@ di@@ e is exclusively as a five @-@ fifth in a conventional and an acc@@ entu@@ ated solo GT .
&quot; as of the trade he is coming to trade at the beginning of next year , then also as Kom@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ spin@@ ach wants to find its location in the strongly growing segment in the new model .
&quot; thereby , the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the base model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
&quot; the offer is also a diesel comprising 80 kW / 109 HP , or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere .
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ lit@@ re tower and an output of 82 kW / 111 . &quot;
the maximum torque is after manufacturing information with 170 New@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 that is seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; at the outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n ow@@ l took its hand to the front row : here , the cooling grill has been re @-@ drawn , and the changed search@@ lights were fitted with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior of the interior , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , which reduces the number of buttons by touch@@ screen and for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the number of over@@ work@@ stations and new variants are added to the IA@@ A in the compact class , such as the Mercedes @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
&quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters , are man @-@ worthy &quot;
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court made an ex @-@ prisoner , the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary vessel slo@@ wing which was placed in a small cell in a month . &quot;
&quot; because of the injury of their human dignity , in@@ mates are essentially eligible for financial compensation when they are placed in too small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in one on Wednesday .
those affected may say that judges can even hope for money when they were only locked in tight spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; in that it was an ex prisoner , and his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was located in the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single booth with around five square meter floor space ; the toilet was likewise assigned to space . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has now been moved to a bigger cell after data of his lawyer . &quot;
his acqu@@ er@@ sti@@ ce acqu@@ ires because of the un@@ worthy Ar@@ med Forces on the State of Berlin though .
&quot; but the Constitutional judge , the verdict of the Berlin chamber in Berlin and rejected the return to the renewed examination . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons to be decisive for compensation only a few days time will be decisive for compensation , it says . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; an increase of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the chamber of Uganda must now clarify the amount of Comp@@ ens@@ ation .
the Constitutional in@@ verter has often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
&quot; they said only in April an in@@ mate ; compensated , because it was naked in one cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy , according to the decision of 2011 , also the multi @-@ reference point of one cell cannot be separated without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; Karlsruhe , in addition , on Wednesday also the Berlin constitutional Court , who had an in@@ mate ; in November 2009 it had an un@@ worthy accommodation . &quot;
&quot; the then se@@ wage s@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had more than three months a day , from 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
the Berlin prisons were recently taken to the headlines in the past few weeks .
&quot; the prisoners therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to blows , because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information the judicial pressure , 21 places in te@@ as@@ parag@@ us were not occupied because of young lack of money , 19 were supposed to be away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are able to create this &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the chan@@ cell@@ or is resolved to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; about 800 000 asylum seekers , according to progn@@ oses of the Federal Ministry , are coming to Germany this year , according to the statement by vice @-@ chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can create it . &quot;
what comes in Germany provides the following overview .
&quot; the different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( valuation of the Federal Ministry of Labour ) and 400@@ ,000 ( valuation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - and the next five years . &quot;
that &apos;s almost twice as much as it was built before ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing however is dramatically in pre@@ paid lease objects : 60 000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from the rental fees , and for these particularly favorable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; federal ministries in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) wants to double the promotion , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing must be created each year , and this would have to invest a reduction in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; if scientists and Federal Minister of Federal Minister , scientists and Federal Minister of Federal Minister agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in the housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the Institute for Employment Research and occupational research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the greenhouse in Germany can be considered . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not asked systematically for their qualifications in order to help them get started with , critic@@ ises the Walter , project man@@ ag@@ ger for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , it is essential if it is working in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the esteem in the reception , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the im@@ migrant , says Migr@@ ation@@ alist Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , it has been given a political shift in Germany : from the employment ban for refugees to support work . &quot;
&quot; while there was in earlier an employment ban for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence compulsory , the asylum seekers , at a residence . &quot;
in society - even because of the lack of qualified labour - the view has prevailed in a way that refugees should quickly become possible in gaining access to the labour market .
a major barrier to access the labour market is a lack of German knowledge .
&quot; until now , there is not yet a sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs are most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the setup of networks is therefore as a view of the Thr@@ es@@ hold of the Royal Road towards In@@ re@@ integration .
&quot; Berlin &apos;s school administration has found that only a few refugees to give their children to the kids , estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; for the ent@@ ro@@ oting parents it is first of all very important to hold the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ as , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Chancell@@ ery . &quot;
to convince the family nonetheless by the benefits of the K@@ ita to more distri@@ butes the management of G@@ ita in different languages .
&quot; if the need for gu@@ ardi@@ ans increase strongly through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - e.g. , by providing greater colleges . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without German knowledge of welcome classes .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but as in Berlin , also of teachers , who have only one qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; at them there is no lack , says Be@@ ate St@@ aven@@ ues from the Berlin School administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany would like to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no nation &apos;s asylum seek@@ er or experim@@ ented , the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Im@@ medi@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his attitude now . &quot;
&quot; studies of study , the access to the university could be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; refugees with a sojour@@ n or de@@ ple@@ tion does not receive services after the asylum @-@ performance law , if they begin studying . &quot;
the latter are in principle not a BA@@ Fö@@ G because they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ ites people .
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years until now , to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1st January 2016 at shortened on 15 months . &quot;
&quot; however , also these funding gap must be closed , however , we call for Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lin State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should embrace the same rights as compared to Islam , as they have the churches and further develop the existing state @-@ of @-@ church law to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important for the creation of an Islamic welfare association , which is professional for new arrivals . &quot;
on the rights also duties included .
&quot; so , the representative of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to work with the state in many fields and to deal with certain possibilities of control . &quot;
&quot; this also includes the willingness to respond to religious fundament@@ alism , as well . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maced@@ oni@@ k , expressed in the Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be accepted in Germany too . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to fight such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to be here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he suggested that the Basic Law can translate to Arab .
&quot; in future , integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in future . &quot;
&quot; with this , the majority society must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is ever more pressing . &quot;
Germany has indeed - as the result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination point and General Equality Act .
&quot; but it is very slow , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , systematically ignored in the police and authorities the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migration organizations and stakeholders with non @-@ white German already demand a long time , and the international agreements , like the anti @-@ rac@@ ec@@ ot@@ ings of Germany , must become a reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens are supposed to use their possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide emergency response to the previously expected refugees , says Doc@@ tor Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ - Power and capacities , we create , &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would have to be integrated into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , claim Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all com@@ ers as equal to the registration of health insurance . &quot;
the services could later be p@@ ayed by the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and in the long term , it was highly questionable , as many people over@@ sight with the limited performance catalogue as the asylum @-@ winning law . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , doctors first make the language barriers , especially for language barriers . &quot;
&quot; as far as now , the scientists in Berlin have proven N@@ a Bor@@ de , they are worse about their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpre@@ ter services , not only in clinics , also having been taken over interpre@@ ter &apos;s costs , demands it . &quot;
&quot; however , to many refugees would be even more gener@@ alized in Emer@@ gency Plans . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; under refugee quot@@ as , there are much more un@@ dealt with disabilities , and the young people go about HIV . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other path@@ ologies , German doctors travelled from their training but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as for the anger of the sle@@ e@@ ws , it is also possible even to allevi@@ ate the allevi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a high developed educational system , several refugees are actually doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to practice , however , they would have to demonstrate their qualifications and take a further examination once again . &quot;
at least half of the refugees pending in Germany is based on estimates of the post @-@ catech@@ ism ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psych@@ ologically . most of them suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; particularly vulnerable to the refugee camp , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
&quot; a recent study by TU München shows , that every five Syrian refugee s@@ like traumati@@ zed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; who is suffering from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder , is suffering from among others the so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , verti@@ go , p@@ inning and death @-@ kan@@ gar@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are bed@@ time and concentration , heavy over@@ due and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically acceptable , an early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically inf@@ ecting refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill who can provide asylum seekers in social relations at a request for psych@@ otherapy , however the processing takes mostly several months . &quot;
&quot; moreover , in the social concerns , generally speaking workers or doctors which are not trained for the psych@@ ic conditions , whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this is often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dreams
&quot; with the new staging &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; the Circus itself takes back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; its aim is to draw any age group to the ban of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animals dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus enters into the riding arena on the bricks of the was@@ en for dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can not imagine without my Circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie pro@@ vi , Ti@@ gh@@ bred and junior staff . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ e@@ al staging .
&quot; already for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift for inspiration is the family in the blood .
&quot; it is important to take away the people from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , empha@@ sizes the 27 @-@ year junior level of June . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world @-@ style atmosphere , &quot; says director Reinhard pro@@ x his concept . &quot;
50 towns on the almost 3 000 km tour can experience this flair .
the programme of the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from around the world .
honoured at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ flo@@ v Clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers would also understand their craft .
the Cub@@ an duo wants to pick up the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and flexibility - with these words they identify themselves .
their hum@@ orous art at the mast is to conquer women &apos;s sket@@ ches in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus - also fills with finger@@ tips and jo@@ int@@ ousness . &quot;
balanced with the wheel on a bowl ?
for He Yuan not a problem .
slim men really fascin@@ ate and frightened them at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascinated by their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in all respects .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
abnorm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only so often the topic of different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie pro@@ die also takes position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , does it not at all well . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ legged g@@ sts , &quot; as it is lovingly called , is read by the eyes of every wish from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel well and does not want it into the riding arena .
so the upper@@ most commandment is : good for the animals provide .
&quot; it is specially on their z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ vel , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together eight years in a pen and nothing is happening .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo is there , &quot; said Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus . &quot;
the environment for each visitor is likely to be something .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie pro@@ die : &quot; whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are happy with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Krone invites 17 to 20 September daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 am and 16 o &apos;clock .
Thursday is Family Day and the prices at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
&quot; furthermore , everyday life is open from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ pl@@ under@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe keeps wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , was at the beginning of the year from a podium down the stairs . &quot;
&quot; no , he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was made also di@@ mm@@ ed by statements of members of the opposition , that they had given anonymous threats and warned them to be warned by Mr Co@@ ating Mr Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; last month , they had bu@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech to the situation of the nation in the parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said , that seven Op@@ positions or SMS messages received from their mobile phones that they warned , Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message returns from a number that is not shown , but she has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists by Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; she will be warned of the members of the Parliament , that the immunity of the Parliament will end and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said that the party was &quot; concerned by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is going to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to plant about 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in the restructuring and savings @-@ reduction efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will start off later this year in two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service business activities .
&quot; the expected job creation leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion , as of the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , to direct the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a wide and expanded portfolio of shops that will help companies move to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual 2012 revenue and &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ fun@@ nel , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; said the company &apos;s declaration . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave G@@ ard , to manufacture electro @-@ plants and their Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to overcome the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field that is based on the conviction that closely focused companies deliver better performance . &quot;
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and provided that his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere is sure to miss at least the next four games for England and , given its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this issue is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had stopped the last season after a separate button of knees and then returned to his old swing during the off season .
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
there is a bone that is not well healed .
it is not a greater matter .
this was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in touch with the knees , or with the wounds that he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from a medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger even recognized that there is a related peri@@ l of further injuries , always when a player is trying to return at the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the investigation of Premier In@@ j@@ uries Ltd provides 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut in six years .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als of 157 Lig@@ asp@@ el in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider photo for arsen@@ al is that they have been in six of eight play @-@ times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League clubs , who have recorded most of the most vulner@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; turn does not accept the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the risk of injury during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an accidental time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain power . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it , and that he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins the Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ ah Zagreb in front of the Games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur the next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces itself to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also tackle K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to balance the balance and give players that need it to give a little off @-@ off , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; though arsen@@ al are clear favour@@ ites , through group F to come back , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the toys with the biggest intimi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated , after 41 games , after the &quot; un@@ defeated &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
the stadium was celebrated on Tuesday evening by a devastating earthqu@@ akes that were measured on the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven from the distant hope , with his management to lead the association to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly festival : the com@@ edy Show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships !
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more dist@@ res@@ sed as ever , as self @-@ suicide would prove among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 , and it remains more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CAL@@ M - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched existence ) 2015 hosted the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to tackle this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms proved that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship may work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of more than social media , with its focus on style on substance , in@@ compatibility of the response is often more important than a significant contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strongly , vital and successful , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by the fact that psych@@ ologists are ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health a lot more profound . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
&quot; the goodness of friends was , that this focus was put on the head . &quot;
&quot; each character has not been defined by his labour , but by his personality created by the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments in the football stadium and the longing for Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can refer to this , even though they often go back to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a employee of telep@@ hon@@ ing care , I explained : ... &quot; my c@@ eption role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , showed me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk to friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come to cope &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling of being perceived as a weakness if one speaks about problems open . &quot;
&quot; happiness is one of the shows that come to mind , if I try to provide longer @-@ term transfers . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective ou@@ se@@ ab@@ ites status via the phone the people in moments of despair may also help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if at this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest visit the perfect setting to celebrate this weekend , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you were a Star@@ bucks alone , give him a smile and say hello to you . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship might be .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; Mary meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to cr@@ ate &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates in Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Sam@@ son Cav@@ ani after his place to Malmö .
&quot; in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and nominated son Cav@@ ani held a course in Paris Saint @-@ Germain has started the Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Anni@@ versary Par@@ a on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French champion on the way , but after that they announced a number of opportunities before she finally achieved their lead , than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k , also in the group A Paris also needs a strong launch against the Swedish Masters , since they not only asp@@ ire the qualification for the K.@@ O.@@ -@@ round@@ ings , but an improvement on the way to the quarter of the past three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a class@@ ed from Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an embro@@ ider@@ y chances in front of the gate . he later began in play against his hometown @-@ team and against the association with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . thus it &apos;s a good start , 2 : 0 to win off our opponents and to relax even if there are certain things we have still perf@@ ecting in the course of the season , &quot; said blan@@ c . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we have not yet scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris Team , who could hold the second League at his second place against Bordeaux on the first League , but he was o@@ be@@ yed by Di Maria at the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ in@@ ean wing line was described as the man to take the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran at Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis passport behind the Malmö defense until he finished Johan Wil@@ and passing beautiful into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; but if any one believed that PS@@ G was winning a great victory , that was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach this level , stood at An@@ op@@ ia with nine national players in the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in mid@@ field flas@@ hes a big opponent . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who visits far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ ill@@ age in the 3@@ 4th minute , she offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes got on , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least by le@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who was in no less than five attempts alone in the first half p@@ atz@@ te and then abandoned after cav@@ ani used him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved much more skill than he brought his fellow @-@ players into the game , and it was a pass from Char@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic who turned Di Mary into a turning back , which was turned by Wil@@ derness in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole box ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short following the hr @-@ mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans , thus achieved its sixth season , after having bought hi@@ mo@@ vic a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malmö can come back to the game , and only one excellent entrance from Wil@@ de out of no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz won the end result could be low before substitute folks Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malmö &apos;s Age Har@@ conscious , given that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish League and did not play the same level .
the qualification games are not sufficient .
hut off Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola cras@@ hed 2008 change to FC Bayern
world - and European Championships X@@ avi . since summer 2015 played for the el @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which played at that time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times of champion titles , four times champion champion , two times the champion of the champion , two times the champion , one with champion titles - the titles @-@ list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the UK left 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ 1 Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi , now that he was already standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 . &quot;
someone told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won in the time everything , we told nothing . &quot;
and the registered office of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ saw wanted to have me . &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 Ju@@ er@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not reloc@@ ate
the change did not come about .

PE@@ P has told me I would not change the team without me .

Matt Dam@@ on plays a variety in film makers
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on pushed the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the variety and said , she didn &apos;t need behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a sequence of Sunday night from H@@ B@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown participated as if he emphas@@ ised the need for alternative perspectives while in relation to a black protagonist in his chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , you do it during the cast of the film and not at the cast of the show , &quot; insured Dam@@ on &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with loaded dis@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; hoo ! wow ! okay , &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian was established . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown in@@ closed producing wines , Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ el @-@ brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will also be the director - like they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a wet one , which is being pressed by her white ascent . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People was nominated for the Fin@@ alist Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on declared that their direction &quot; will give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the Social Media recently became dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Mr Po@@ oni expressed his fur@@ y over the clip by wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain their diversity - that is SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et earned over 5,000 Ret@@ ri@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ ke since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments come to a time when accurate rac@@ ec@@ ti@@ ation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teenage Michael Brown was killed by a white poli@@ cem@@ an in 2014 , the movement of Black lives for bo@@ oths were widely used and urged judicial authorities and authorities to discrimin@@ atory practices against colored contents . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a play on the movement during the introduction of the released albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album Gr@@ aces , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , albums also have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Movement of Black lives , published an explanation , and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Ha@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hatred group . &quot;
&quot; the network of Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ pris@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l , who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss about the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or made it already the pop@@ e is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
&quot; professional sports@@ plane and operator ; Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; competition show , which had just graduated from the 7th season , had never experienced a competition winner who was able to complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman and cam@@ er@@ aman B@@ ritten , until the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , the rock climbing has one 75 feet long rock climbing in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ritten had completed the task within the period , which he was the first athle@@ te until finished Warri@@ or Warri@@ or &apos;s exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero made this challenge fully three seconds faster , which made him winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or before life , &quot; &quot; Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the guiding producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with Hollywood interference to discuss the final , and why B@@ ritten , although he was the first final course , not receiving any prize . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; We@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed ; he gets the great re@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s about it in a Gro@@ ll .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
&quot; masses of achievements , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ god .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; To@@ gh@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , I am glad there is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think , Isaac Herzog should have felt just about having had the roles . &quot;
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a eighth season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers E@@ ven@@ ing from Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers on their final position in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , but played the part perfect on Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field . &quot;
the twins cus@@ pi@@ ke a chance to climb within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League game .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F &apos;s Word , which was so difficult for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad &apos;s extremism . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave its early offensive support to set up its early offensive support as Detroit three times in the first two inside ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) suggested 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner and made it possible for three days .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in each game in the bull@@ fighting game , and therefore I will fully concentrate in the game . &quot;
&quot; the commission@@ er @-@ design@@ ate Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches , and was in two ranks , the first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since then he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he has got the impact good &quot; , &quot; said out@@ la@@ . &quot;
&quot; he looked good with the ( stri@@ pped training ) , looked much better in the Bull@@ ring , and he carried it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three of us in the back@@ meeting at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had the best chance to get back into the game . &quot;
center fiel@@ der B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a car@@ unt , and Simon carried his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ ors to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy covered the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the lam@@ inn@@ ed ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who gave the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w ha@@ ges a two @-@ run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finishing @-@ run in the second brought Ver@@ ges the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor to a double Play .
that was the major league tournament in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ps made a double play
&quot; after Detroit added to an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth , the wall led an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
however the right @-@ handed sc@@ ended S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his 5th Save .
Detroit benefited the opening of the game by an even out@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three of us at the first two inn@@ ings in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been stro@@ ked before the game by the viol@@ in@@ list , after he was missing for a bac@@ kl@@ ess than a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted to have , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt at ease when I laid out and sen@@ sing that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches since in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they got in the first the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hai saw a Single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought the Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z in the game that played a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 track record with the runner in the scoring position .
&quot; the third of the Nick Castell@@ anos followed by a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to enter the third , as he finished the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers submitted a one @-@ out Double out of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann , and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony G@@ osis to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it has not done very well , but he has got the right position . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch @-@ vain , generated no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed A.@@ I.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three of us with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
note : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez deri@@ ves from a violation of the litter ri@@ ms .
&quot; he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; since mid @-@ August San@@ chez , founded on the viol@@ ten@@ list because of a school@@ ing , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the offen@@ ders will be canc@@ eled for the T@@ wins . &quot;

hundreds of refugees arrive in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees on the way to Hessen .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; and in that , people should be accommodated in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden , like the city of Wiesbaden communicated in Wiesbaden . &quot;
it was expected from 450 to 750 to eight years to come .
several sports halls of the h@@ ess@@ ent@@ state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees may be temporarily destroyed . &quot;
it should then be distributed to other municipalities .
in the past ten days the Federal President of the interim President G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people have arrived in Hessen .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have been established in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ l : German military action in Syria
&quot; the head of Munich &apos;s Security conference , Wolfgang Klein@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the un@@ determined re@@ think about military action options must not be held without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &apos; collective imagination &apos; .
four years ago I was happy that the cup of a military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends past our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Germany . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive rise of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls the southern and eastern borders
&quot; according to Germany , Austria has again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Chamber of Interior in Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , after Hungary will no one be returned . &quot;
also Germany did not sk@@ ate refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , it is so agreed &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement , which Germany could include a specific number of refugees from Austria per day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , started in a relevant talks between the Director @-@ General for Public Safety and representatives of Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers often called them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , dozens of refugees came to Austria on the so @-@ called Bal@@ a@@ route from Hungary to Austria in recent days . &quot;
the most important part of Germany is Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ man requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had passed on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to accept a new startup for binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee &apos;s programme in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries for the up@@ take and distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is going to manage this in co @-@ operation with the countries , the Chancellor Merkel announced the late evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Off@@ ices in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ scored that those people , the shelter , came to this too . &quot;
but who did not make a lead in Germany could not stay in Germany too .
this view was expressed in the round of the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole should now be a huge force of force .
thousands of des@@ perate refugees now stuck on the Balkan mountain route .
Hungary closed its 175 kilometres long border with Serbia at night on Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours after it announced the government in Budapest , also called the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent tractor rides from Romania , Hungary Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government def@@ ends the plan immediately .
there were first ar@@ rests of people wanting to cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , like e@@ ye@@ witness , thousands of migrants would report on the way to the Greek border . &quot;

this is the conclusion of observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
so you go ast@@ ray of the moon easily on its path around the ring planning .
&quot; this deaf @-@ movement is only small , but still too large for a full set of cel@@ estial bodies , it is in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers exhibit their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; sheet .
even longer it was known that it must be under the ice @-@ blan@@ ket of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us liquid water .
&quot; since 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; already discovered a vul@@ gar ch@@ ic@@ ane on the south pole of Satur@@ nia , the water vap@@ or and iron particles will feed and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least in the South Pole it had to give an underground sea , observing the astronom@@ ers at that time . &quot;
yet the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .

the 18@@ 60 München has to give up approximately a month on the offensive Val@@ da@@ iri .
a investigation has shown an Ad@@ duc@@ tor &apos;s violation with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old sharing the association .
Rama had set about pain for the start of the week .
&quot; according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis &quot; is scheduled for four weeks of co@@ er@@ cion . &quot;
&quot; this is hit us hard , Rama is a very loss . &quot;

the Cro@@ at currently have the possibility to prove his skills under evidence .
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training after his bra@@ ins &quot; week .
even on Thursday the Austrian National player is supposed to step up to the run .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was in the Game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) in spite of a fierce collision at the head .
but contrary to his first fears he remained without a serious Bl@@ es@@ sage .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and succ@@ ul@@ ose @-@ sweet .
who does not want to pay attention to his slim route will fall away from them often rather .
they do not contain relatively much sugar - above all su@@ cro@@ se .
&quot; healthy is the exotic fruits nevertheless : in them the B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. mainly contain man@@ gos , but a lot of vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who eats the fruits , thus supports visual , immune systems and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying man@@ goes , they should not be too soft or too tight . &quot;
the form@@ work alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste delicious .
they should be consumed at room temperature and consumed in less days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet meals .
there are also a man@@ go but also hearty dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of many leaf@@ lets such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits perfectly to fish , p@@ oul@@ try , lamb and ven@@ der . &quot;

&quot; last year U@@ PS included his staff for the holiday season , around 9@@ 5,000 aid . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex has previously made precautions to be pop@@ up for the Christmas business . &quot;

&quot; on Wednesday and the night for Thursday the blow @-@ burner is partly due to tor@@ r@@ als , due to the tor@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; after the fishing on Thursday morning , a striking kil@@ n confron@@ ts us with a steep rainf@@ alls and a temperature @-@ decline . &quot;
&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News writes in a communication report , Switzerland currently rests on the front of a comprehensive deep @-@ pressure on the British islands in a powerful southern direction . &quot;

during the North on Wednesday G@@ um@@ my F@@ öh@@ n gives rise of temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees the moisture begins to st@@ ew itself at the end of the slope .
here rain is drawing a thing until Thursday night .
&quot; it must be equivalent to some 100 lit@@ res of rain per square meters , half of the Alps in the next 48 hours , that after the last few days they have already fallen large rain @-@ quantities . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the air falls on the air , in the episode rolls a cold front with beating a , partially penetr@@ ated rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front , the wind picked up bo@@ wing down to the icy , and the temperatures go clearly back . &quot;
&quot; the following days are on the north with 15 to 20 degrees , on the south , on the weekends , it is sunny and warmer , with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther field
nearly 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz .
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was baptized in the name of the German Reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honored as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was for request for the work @-@ community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the remainder of the Protest@@ ants in the town of the Pop@@ es over centuries as a Min@@ ority . &quot;
&quot; in the symbolic manner , I &apos;ll see that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome will be welcomed . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) held himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k for the annual turn 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he obtained the city at that time as a welcome sin@@ ner .
his negative impressions are expected to contribute to historians at his later struggle against Rome .
Lu@@ ther then had in use his thes@@ es against the L@@ las@@ sh@@ andel the split of the Dutch church .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt for his Bible painted .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not by the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , who now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Oth@@ mar Alt , who formulated his own personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motiv@@ ations . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and f@@ anci@@ ful forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , the respective subjects are adapted , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar had worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he met a subjective artistic choice from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; stages are cycles that have topics like cross @-@ channels , pl@@ agues , Comm@@ and@@ ments or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
he spontaneously stimul@@ ates several partners : that is the same for the Lu@@ ther publisher with his the@@ ological outlook as well as the Kettler publisher with his focus on art books .
and there is mainly the author Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail dedicated himself on the basis of the paintings with the Bible study .
&quot; he interpreted the Bible study by Oth@@ mar Alt and so to the present , into current relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; it &apos;s embedded between the original Bible showing from Martin Lu@@ ther and one set of the artist , who wrote his very personal thoughts about the particular situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has gold Let@@ ters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allow a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions have ultimately been to be a trigger for the Bible : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 , in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ uter Order . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s what the education had already been with the cane , &quot; reminds himself Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to re@@ do that , maybe also to wear the Lord again with the Lord . &quot;
his second aim is to put back more significance to art in faster times : &quot; the perception of images is today influenced by advertising and this is loud .
symbol@@ ism is em@@ powered .
artists have a different lust and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants that the observer let in the paintings &quot; &quot; come up &quot; , &quot; they have an effect on it , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post delivered on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; he has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts art &quot; : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; he did not take care to grasp the Bible in complete , but which is important for him , as well as mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye @-@ height , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text is simply &quot; &quot; explained &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ers from the Lu@@ ther publisher , this work is an invitation to help you del@@ ve his life and to find freedom . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ers , both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility . &quot;
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen shots - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be inaugurated in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation on 15 November .
construction of the BM@@ X track
&quot; plans made , place found , company commissioned to model ground @-@ covered organ for one round course : one year later everything was done - but still before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration work for pi@@ ping , especially among the residents who do not want to tolerate the train . &quot;
&quot; so Hill was de@@ ported , new place searched - now with formal planning and request for building permit . &quot;
the approval will go down in October to attend the first Municipal Council Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; other memory &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fying commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019 , and the Bundesliga will put a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the soccer player re@@ acts to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy its help in addressing the problems discussed .
&quot; I believe this , the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; in principle , nobody can say that there is nothing else about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to be more interested to get this issue under control , &quot; said senior vice director Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on 23 September he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the Off@@ ices , and refer there the Minister of State Minister , Ms O@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the topic will certainly play a key role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must embody the policy .
the German soccer league has therefore increased his refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; we have the &quot; &quot; E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation &quot; &quot; to ensure that this programme runs through 2019 , &quot; stated Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Juli@@ as / Malta . &quot;
also some federal lig@@ ists can support this programme .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 commission sets a clear sign when taking place on the left triangle instead of the usual sponsor @-@ time logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; We can help - # &apos; welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everybody is to help , where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ and Sport@@ chief Ru@@ di blo@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama every day , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can play football sol@@ o@@ lig@@ ists , no , we have to use our shot power , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; H@@ offen@@ ded Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke from a &quot; prominent symbol of the League . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the European Championship Quali@@ fication of Women on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
&quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach &quot; drew the support of refugees to be &quot; &quot; a great community of German soccer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license parties must have their own projects in their locations , be magnificent . &quot;
&quot; just as great as possible , that small and smallest associations are active . &quot;
&quot; message 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; that we have spent will be lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of huge importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the association is presenting some 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German federal government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs , the whole amount of 2015 have already been called &quot; , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP Board of Directors is now losing an eye
&quot; according to the President of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill M@@ der@@ mati@@ t , has report@@ edly lost sight of several reports by over@@ throwing the beginning of July by the top of July . &quot;
&quot; at the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen to a water @-@ glass after midnight , which he had worn in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost cr@@ ush , was power@@ less , then came out sexually towards the street - that he told us so last week , &quot; the &quot; Wi@@ ki &quot; SAP @-@ founders H@@ asso turn@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his job well .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; Stein@@ ner said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager was with the meeting and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday night ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the international software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; naturally I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman H@@ asso turn@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; indeed , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; if it is important to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said , &quot; Every@@ thing can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; important is , to stand up again , when you fall down . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ substitute pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen apart from skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen was a corresponding photo and explained , he sho@@ cks the violation if he was upset by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore comes from the after@@ market in Singapore last weekend as little as a reservoir for the two friends of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button Re@@ quired about how one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : blowing in the gate
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund all hopes had to be struck for a com@@ eback by Marco Re@@ us in the first group play of the Europe League .
the national player is also the leader of the soccer player in the Bundesliga as well as in du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ am / Sky ) .
&quot; we can not rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be again in the Bundesliga &apos;s top@@ ic@@ orn against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high load of its pros Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his head@@ line at the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change on the go@@ al@@ keeper .
this is why Roman past@@ ure takes its place from the Master &apos;s Roman Bür@@ ki .
&quot; he was trained on an absolute top @-@ level , &quot; praised the football teacher to the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether choice of choice in future in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ackle does not leave any h@@ ackle . &quot;
with a high degree it will also be stre@@ amed the second game .
&quot; the for@@ ging statement of fellow @-@ player Re@@ us , that the final withdrawal of BV@@ B in the Europe League necessary to be the target , holds the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l . &quot;
I think that we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : the government wants to play the pioneering role for Germany
&quot; in Germany , it is supposed to be leading to the will of the federal government in the transformation of the car technological . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the federal cab@@ aret decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Road Minister Alexander Do@@ er@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ er@@ dt said on Wednesday in Frankfurt , on the edge of the fair IA@@ A about a &quot; new mobility age &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected drive will increase road safety and ensure less traffic , &quot; said Do@@ er@@ dt . &quot;
he will also discuss the issue with his ministers from the G@@ 7 countries which will come together with representatives of the industry as well .
&quot; among other things , the strategy paper of the Traffic Law stresses the importance of the mobile broad@@ band @-@ building and of a low @-@ level change on digital radio broad@@ casting . &quot;
the testing of new technology currently occurs on the highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; by allowing the driver to offer &quot; no additional liability risk , &quot; the federal government wants to check the legal framework &quot; &quot; and where necessary to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany wants to employ approximately internationally for that the permitted top @-@ speed for self @-@ driving cars will be lifted from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the federal government is also planning to use the Vienna Convention for a change of the Vienna Convention , which has so far only presented to humans as a driver . &quot;
&quot; during automated driving , the car takes over the direction , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment , and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving will be technically possible for driving up to 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads be expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value added in the area of the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions on site in Germany appreciate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital network of the P@@ c@@ eps can lead to improved safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said the SPD Re@@ bel Police S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; but the question of liability in cases of accidents , and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clarified in a clear way . &quot;
yet the Germans are quite skep@@ tical however - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted by the formation of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test Department DE@@ K@@ RA will result in the outcome that only eight percent of Germans will believe that autonomous cars will continue in the coming ten years , 32 percent do not believe at all in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of the respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after being a meeting of the Bit@@ kom association , only seven percent would agree to allow control during the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway they could even imagine during flowing traffic at least 15 per cent , at a St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth day the car would not leave any circumstances to the car .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM out
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to move according to current status on the title fight from September 25 to October 4 only in a single .
the final decision should be handed down on September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a great loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guys got it in the morning .
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo the title , &quot; said Bit@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
that was part of the flight at this time on the flight to a long term @-@ term warran@@ ties in China .
the 34 year old German master is rep@@ licated on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the disadvantage , we are now no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; declared single @-@ European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who se@@ eded the subsi@@ ding diary in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but reminded also of the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo had also been missing , and we have become European championship . &quot;
&quot; by this we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; &quot; declared the world @-@ tran@@ ts . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier is getting too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
&quot; it is a blend of very large fashion show and a wax @-@ pa@@ inters , the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins , which are terri@@ fying thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections paint . &quot;
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as St@@ out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene , and therefore that he put men into cre@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the tri@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be so easy , in the meantime it is real , &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ ome side@@ walk on the tre@@ ks ) , who is seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO show , it is a bit of luck that the mo@@ des@@ pot@@ ters has changed at a show about his person at first . &quot;
&quot; actually , he was opposed to it because , for me , an exhibition ended a little after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
when one dies there you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and Paris in Canada .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits reveal an insight into that &apos;s hardly an over@@ time work of the man , the fashion of fashion , without ever being a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograp@@ her overall work work , for which much effort was operated : to treat the dolls , for example , a Sty@@ list was married for example . &quot;
14 tons of material have bare the creators of the testimony of the curator &apos;s Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to München .
shortly before the start of the October was a special treat : a lea@@ ther@@ ing out@@ fit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are s@@ lu@@ er as men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; &quot; says Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
also gau@@ dy &apos;s old t@@ ed@@ dy must be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , z@@ oned hairy ram@@ parts of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and poorly dressed in football ) , he put on his t@@ ed@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; if his parents were not allowed to play with a pupp@@ et , his parents would not have allowed him to play . &quot;
he caught the discharge of fashion then by himself .
he st@@ ole fashi@@ on@@ ings and looked at the dra@@ fts of other designers at how Gau@@ l@@ tier was in Munich .
later I bought the stuff of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the mod@@ ulation .
&quot; they got nothing , except they were able to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; it used to be at the long be@@ ck@@ ery machines in and around , to make a meter . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered fabrics and tips came into a large amount for customers , for example they edited it to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone is no longer today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ pel@@ in slots . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze Mode , fashion played a major role , was then pushed out by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : tip in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and in regional tra@@ ints . &quot;
&quot; illustrated clearly the so @-@ called vintage mode , which is opposed to past sti@@ ckers , is an increasing contractor . &quot;
&quot; those who are not serving in the textile branch in Germany is no longer serving the market . &quot;
with us they already make the half of all orders .
Mo@@ hor@@ de Pl@@ ato is joined together with nine other companies in the branch association Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they may apply the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , about 80 percent of sales were cut off . &quot;
private dealers and also the wholesale trade there are almost no more .
our products can hardly be reached on this path .
&quot; nowadays , mass free@@ ware will become much cheaper today in the Asian region , and is distributed almost exclusively by chains . &quot;
&quot; flag@@ ged in exports , up to Russia and the US . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association seeks to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer was explained by the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we perform a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially toler@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this applies also to the materials used . &quot;
diploma @-@ design@@ ate U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Consumer Z@@ wick@@ au School Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty of applied art - and specializes in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to de@@ ple@@ ate the competition from the Asian region , you need to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; this arises a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the factories , which above all must think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to give a customer base . &quot;
a few years ago busy textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter &apos;s historical snow@@ y tip new .
&quot; at the same time , the machine offers little chi@@ cks for a few places . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ manns in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ghts had inspired me , &quot; &quot; I could not do anything with traditional plumbing . &quot;
&quot; now they use the snow@@ y tip for their jewelry . &quot;
in an elaborate process they dominates the pattern of silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic of &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; she also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in directories and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the moti@@ on@@ less leader . &quot;
Disney is planning new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movies

&quot; after the &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not a novel@@ ist , but about a kind of continuation , the 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the Family B@@ anks in the times of the financial crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open from wider to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was commissioned with the governance of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should enti@@ ce up foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in a discussion at the 16 session of the Central executive group on deepening an extensive reform . &quot;
&quot; reform new ups and advance reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and bring new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leadership group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policies , private capital ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the local population . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a neg@@ ativity @-@ list will be created , which will not address the sectors and companies that are not questioned . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is essential , since it indicates the market a greater role in the allocation of resources to ensure a legal commercial environment and open the market open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and ensure that companies decide how they manage their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China is going to allow borders , new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; as part of an offer , nationally controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will make the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; for foreigners , it is easier to apply for foreigners , to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; , in the application requirements and the application process will be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to ensure their activities are carried out , and professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors were also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting the Premier Li Can@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ nan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli became part , as was reported in a declaration issued after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury threshold in rob@@ bery
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in large volumes and the consumers with it a much higher dose of nerve activity .
&quot; consumer Organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , providing a corresponding working paper at the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp@@ ly : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects &quot; inf@@ alli@@ zed industrial and environmental policy , &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the border values of the CN@@ po@@ ison are expected to collect large fish at the end of the food chain , such as sh@@ arks or sh@@ tick , on economic reasons &quot; by one to two milli@@ gram , per kilo@@ gram of fish . &quot;
&quot; great predat@@ ory Fish , however , are already so strong with mer@@ cury , that in the basis of the remaining limits for roughly 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after the dou@@ bling of the threshold , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be f@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; in return for this loos@@ ening , the EU intends to tigh@@ ten the threshold values at other fish from currently 0,5 milli@@ grams to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch does this however as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller plac@@ id @-@ fish , like car@@ p are usually so low more heavily , that they already keep the planned maximum levels already today . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ sen@@ sion for Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del@@ ment man@@ oeu@@ vre that helps alone the economy &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a powerful tool for man that is highly toxic to the food chain above all in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
&quot; the German government is therefore warning that &quot; &quot; little amounts of particularly in the unknown injuries of the nervous system &quot; could cause . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Ministry of Education , on its homepage , with regard to the applicable dat@@ agri@@ d values , however , is that an &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; can not be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly coming through the coal @-@ combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written authorisation of the Federal Environment Ministry , the German Federal Ministry of Labour to the Green Par@@ liam@@ mes On@@ alena Ba@@ er@@ r grows more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total population in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; &quot; had quoted the &quot; Spiegel &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
last year Europe @-@ wide warning against mer@@ cury in fish already used to the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ system RA@@ S@@ FF .
F@@ ood@@ watch is calling for consumer to protest against the EU &apos;s plans for under : www.@@ qu@@ eck@@ ware transaction .
