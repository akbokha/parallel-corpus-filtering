B ) The organization requires only the minimum level of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of their tasks in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; ( II ) Information about systems are restricted to the minimum level , which is subject to secure security measures in relation to nuclear material , which is subject to secure security measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ) On the request of the community , the organization is ready to consider investment data that respects the community as being particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not require the organisation of material , provided they remain open for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community without any further access . &quot;
a ) The organization brings the consent of the Community and the states to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the States .
&quot; II ) the community arises either against an proposed naming , or at any time against a given designation , so proposes the organisation of the community and the states one or more of alternatives . &quot;
&quot; to agree on the repeated ref@@ usal of the community , the naming of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which is imp@@ aired by the Convention as the General Director of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the General Director &quot; - therefore , with the aim of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the countries concerned are taking the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization are actually able to actually acquire them according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are designed so that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities are as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other In@@ spec@@ tors of the organization to be informed of confidential information .
&quot; every state is opposed to the organization , including their assets , funds and assets , as well as against their inspec@@ tors and other officials , according to their inspec@@ tors , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the security measures after this Convention are termin@@ ated with regard to core material , if the community and the organization realize that the material is consumed or used in a way that it is suitable for a nuclear activity , which is under the point of view of the security measures of Bel@@ ang , is no longer usable or practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; the community noted , the organisation is subject to the transfer of this Convention to the transfer of nuclear material from the states , which is subject to the securing measures of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures after this Convention are termin@@ ated in regard to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as envisaged in this Convention , is responsible for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; the organization guides documents , out of which any transfer and if necessary , the re@@ use of the backup actions on the given nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; is intended to use nuclear material , security measures after this Convention , in non @-@ nuclear tasks , such as the production of allo@@ ys or ceramic , then agreed to the community with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the backup actions can be completed with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the not@@ ables used during the duration of non @-@ use of the backup measures after this agreement is not used to produce nuclear weapons and other core compounds .
&quot; B ) The organization and the community take a rule , that the backup measures intended in this Convention will be only as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , these backup measures will not be applied as long and under what circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures planned in this Convention will once again be applied as soon as the core material will be attributed to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is held on the total amount and composition of this material in the relevant state or in the concerned states and on any transfer of such material from this state or states to the current state .
&quot; this explains its consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as inter @-@ time and proced@@ ural regulations and agreements for reporting , but does not endor@@ se one endor@@ sement or one under intelligence protection knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the use of the nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the states or persons , are subject to their territory , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special awakening of the organization , thus re@@ funded the organisation of these costs , provided that they are prepared in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , required by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states make sure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , are entitled to the organisation and other provisions for the purposes of implementing this Convention in the same way as the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim , which the community or the state is governed by the organization or the organization towards the community or a state because of damages - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident , is governed in line with international law . &quot;
&quot; provides the Council to test the information submitted by him from the General Director , that the organization has not been able to rep@@ airing itself by means of retro@@ inspection , that no nuclear material , which according to this Convention shall be subject to statutes , or other core reports , and may also take the other measures listed there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps the Council considered to be gained in which mass appropri@@ ated by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractors is affected - any acceptable opportunity to provide the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in order to seek the organization , the community or a state find consultations on issues which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are justified , therefore ask that questions that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention , can be tested by the Council . &quot;
the Council charges the community and the affected state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any disputes resulting from the Council to Article 19 or one of the Council , there are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not made by negotiation or by another of the organization , the community and the states unified , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States ren@@ ame two arbitr@@ ators , the organization will also use two arbitr@@ ators , and the four stated arbitr@@ ator will elect a fifth , which presi@@ ding the presidency . &quot;
&quot; if the community and the organization or the organization are three days after the request for a refer@@ ee , the community or the organization will seek the President of the international tribunal to appoint this arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable if land@@ locked days after the naming or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator , the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a majority of members of the arbitration law must be taken and all decisions must be subject to the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbitration proceedings are binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; a ) This Convention shall be listed for non @-@ proliferation states , the contracting party of the contract and shall become members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization is listed , that its procedures are completed for the entry into force of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the community of the organization is listed , it is able to apply their security measures with regard to this state for the purpose of this Convention . &quot;
a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other in seeking one of the parties parties relating to a change of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The Director @-@ General teaches all Member States of the organization immediately from any amendment of this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organisation of the Community and the states will receive the written Noti@@ fication that its procedures are completed for the entry into force .
B ) The Convention shall remain in force as long as the states are the contracting party of the contract .
the term &quot; Convention &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the protocol together .
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure used in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on security measures , such as necessary . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the backup measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gence results of peaceful nuclear operations for the production of nuclear weapons and other core @-@ compounds for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such ab@@ bi@@ ction due to the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the submission of the set out in Article 28 , the materials handling as a backup of fundamental importance , inter@@ connected with the spatial sub@@ mar@@ cation and observation as important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
the technical degree of veri@@ fications by the organization is performed by an explanation in which for any material complexity that is not listed for a specified period of time under specification of the accuracy of the limits for the given boundary .
&quot; when carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization continues 3 full use of the Community &apos;s safety system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material zones .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following way and they , as far as necessary , see how they are determined in the complementary paragrap@@ hs . &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the amounts of preserv@@ ated , trans@@ vers@@ ed , lost , lost , or in other ways out of the stock of remote material and the stock ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;
&quot; C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of the sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedure for evaluation of accumulation not measured stock and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which consisted of the core materi@@ alist and the changes of this continuance including the one - and outputs of the material zone ; &quot;
G ) precautions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements shall be performed correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures after this agreement are not limited to material in mining or in the industry .
&quot; B ) becomes ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ ori@@ zation material that has not yet reached under letter c ) in the states , so the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material provided that it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; the core material , which is suitable according to composition and purity for the fuel @-@ production or the process phase , in which it is manufactured , or will be introduced in a later stage of the core fuel @-@ cycle material into the states , so it is subject to the others listed in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention shall not be enforced in Article 11 conditions , however , the community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , the backup actions according to this Convention is not possible or desirable , if the organization and community consult each other via the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions stipul@@ ated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community will determine that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following nuclear material from the backup measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special p@@ able material when it is used in grams - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear operations according to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is backward , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request the community fre@@ es the organization &apos;s nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to backup measures after this Convention , unless the entire , because of this article in the states liber@@ ated nuclear generation at no time is more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kilograms of special p@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ( II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by dissemin@@ ating its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ( III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment that is under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural colo@@ uring , is comp@@ uted by multi@@ plying its weight with the run@@ way square in the sub@@ str@@ ation ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten m@@ etr@@ al tons of natural sor@@ bers , and disman@@ tled ur@@ an@@ ium with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0,@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) twenty m@@ etr@@ al tons with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or among them ;
&quot; shall be consul@@ ted with nuclear material , combined with nuclear material , which is subject to secure or stored in accordance with this Convention , will take precautions for the re@@ use of backup actions on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements that are required in the scope , which is necessary for successful and effective obtaining of the tasks of the organisation according to this Convention , in which the procedures specified in the Convention shall apply . &quot;
&quot; the supple@@ mental agreements can be changed or modified , without amendment of the convention , between the organization and the community . &quot;
&quot; the supple@@ mental agreements will come into force simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention . the Organization , the Community and the States make up efforts to come into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this deadline is required by the organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
&quot; the organization put on the basis of the initial survey of the total survey of the entire , the backup actions of this convention in the states , regardless of its origin , and in the following reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ER NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC decided to contribute to the special offers established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation Agreement , in order to meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ ale cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ problems . &quot;
&quot; it is the objective of the EEC and the Member States , that the whole of the Member States shall be bound up into force of the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force of loan , and the organization will be possible to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; D ) The EEC and the Organization consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mid@@ line divisions , to ensure a broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC Commission has presented a table , which is visible , in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization draws a special account under the name &quot; special transaction &quot; which consists of the funds , which shall contribute to the special transaction account ; this account will be designated by the organization as administrator &apos;s administration , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special account will be separated and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ ins@@ ulated notes of the Member State , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the state to order of the organization as governor of the special transaction and to be deposited in the department of the organisation in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two rates , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution of 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the administrator agreed upon ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount of the remainder of the remainder is on 1 January 1979 , or at a different time between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ ter , taking into account the necessary deadlines for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State may provide payments before the above @-@ mentioned schedules .
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker takes in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization about dis@@ proportionate draw on the cash or the school , to cover the expenditure for the special transaction and the special transaction in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of this loan , the car@@ et@@ akers can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC : &quot;
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit capacity , without delay ; and &quot;
VII ) the scope of which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special transaction is the financing of a clearly restruc@@ tural and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development program or proj@@ ections ( including a sec@@ toral program ) , which applies irrespective of whether or not , according to the procedures and practices that are funded for the or@@ derly means of organization financed by the organization , the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement is to be considered . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the transaction must not be used instead of regulatory funds from the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or institution , which are already approved by the directors or organisation in the part of the contract , which are already approved by the directors of the bank or the organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special dispens@@ ations are subject to the same withdrawal terms , which are generally applicable to the organization provided by the organization ; they are therefore refundable at ten open @-@ years each in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; not@@ aries are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are refundable in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay these bones are directly connected to the organization that retains them .
&quot; any special transaction is expressed by a separate col@@ lateral agreement between the beneficiaries , and the car@@ et@@ ter , in which in particular the origin of the funds is indicated . &quot;
&quot; revenues from any special deadline may be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and the according to what the car@@ et@@ aker has been determined at the time of the loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special deadline . &quot;
&quot; capital deposits of special transaction taxes are carried out on the special account , and in this way the amount paid back to the currency of a Member State shall return as soon as possible by the administrator at the concerned Member State . &quot;
the administrator has taught the EEC to the full allocation of all special deadline for the EEC via the directors in preparation and on the plans and programmes approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of withdrawal of the special transaction , the administrator has taught the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction , and the previous editions . &quot;
&quot; by the EEC as soon as possible after the termination of the financial year of the Organization , the EEC sends a detailed statement of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization to this account . &quot;
&quot; following a full payout of the deadline , the EEC will send the EEC as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects financed by the special transaction . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and performs suitable records and billing , from which the contributions received on the special account , which exp@@ elled from the receipt and paid out of the account and paid the pay@@ outs to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the ste@@ ward work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; in order to do this , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ ter to the complete issue of means of the special transaction of time to time , provided an exchange of information about the state of the special transaction , the further agreements or projects and on all other issues that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization shall agree , not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the entire capital is paid back in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties are ex@@ termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; this agreement requires permission from the individual Member States and the EEC , according to the legal provisions of each party . &quot;
the governments of the Member States refer to the Secretary General of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secretary @-@ tariff leads these noti@@ fications together with a notification of the regulatory approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
&quot; this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which is followed up to the day of receipt of the stated notification in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is defined in two inscri@@ ptions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with each word to the masses . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement on the form of a stamp changes to the amendment of Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Confederation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT adopted the following regulation : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cs
&quot; the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community , named &quot; Euratom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; and THE Swiss E@@ id@@ gen@@ ossen@@ schaft , named &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , listed below &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental plant , called J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Joint Company under Chapter V of the Euratom Treaty - be named &quot; &quot; Community Business J@@ ET &quot; &quot; - listed below . &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research work in the controlled fusion of the nuclear fusion and the Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ ology and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is yet to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to avoid unnecessary barriers and work their respective research , which have achieved higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to move through a merger of its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ m@@ ap@@ hysi@@ cs , to avoid unnecessary barriers , and consequently the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost of competitive electricity generation by using the controlled kernel reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties associate the parties in Annex I and II of this Agreement , named &quot; Euratom program &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure an effective collaboration over the Swiss programme , the Swiss programme assumes the long @-@ term objectives and the forms of cooperation between the Euratom plan ; it is amended or modified that there may be new activities relevant to the Euratom program . &quot;
&quot; every time , if the parties are taking a new program , this will take place in the site of the program or the programs listed in Annex I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association planned in paragraph 1 is realized by : - proper participation of each of the parties parties , during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of the staff under the Department of Laboratory in the Euratom Member States , Switzerland and the third @-@ party states with which Euratom organised a similar agreement as the present agreements named &quot; Associ@@ ated Third Parties , &quot; as well as the laboratories that work on the Euratom programme ; &quot;
- the right to access scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the aim of the present agreement , Switzerland is involved in J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association agreement set out in Article 2 , the association agreement signed an association agreement , named &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which corresponds as far as possible to those between the Commission and the States and companies or persons , listed below &quot; Associ@@ ated organs &quot; , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Euratom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Euratom is concerned that Switzerland is involved with the adoption of the current agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as an agreement on personnel exchange . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the current agreement with the Common Market J@@ ET , its stat@@ ute was accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Euratom is concerned that Switzerland must become a contractor of any contract whose target falls within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts made by Euratom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the organs , which are commissioned with the implementation of the association in Article 2 @-@ 1 of the present agreement , are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and the association agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor and direct the development of research projects and thus achieving the best possible results in accordance with the aims of this agreement .
&quot; by a maximum of two delegates , Switzerland is referred to as the &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; group in the following &quot; VG &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Euratom program , is true to all research and development activities , to which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and determines its T * s interest in the interest of the two parties involved in the Euratom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as in Article 1 of the present agreement , due to consideration the scientific and technological developments in the world . &quot;
&quot; after the introduction of its business order , VG or several Swiss representatives in the framework of the Euratom programme created consultants , whenever the competent Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the advisory boards , which will provide the VG research proposals in view of the best possible scientific results , take this task with respect to all research and development work , to which are addressed in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented in the Committee of the Euratom Programme Committee and the director of one of the laboratories participating in the laboratory .
&quot; the directors , who has to monitor the implementation of the Euratom plan and is responsible for the capacity of the laboratories that are involved in the scope of the program work , are exploited this task with respect to all research and development processes that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , he cares for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Euratom programme and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordinating the coordinating programme in the meetings of the Euratom programme .
&quot; coordination of the directors suitable to the Committee on the best possible use of resources , staff , and knowledge and skills on which the tasks involved in the implementation of the Euratom program have involved , assume this task in the respective area with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F include one of the core and energy @-@ related representatives of each Member State of Euratom , Switzerland and each Associ@@ ated Third State . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission on the implementation of the program and possible changes in terms of exec@@ utions and setting up their overall potential , coordination and integration of national activities on community level in the field of merger . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director of Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordin@@ ating committees have an advisory character . &quot;
&quot; the opinion of VG to the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the committees of directors in the area of personnel exchange . &quot;
&quot; the representatives of both parties involved work on the work of all the technical consultants , bodies of all administrative committees , which are created for the purposes of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution of Switzerland at the Euratom plan according to this agreement is determined annually to the costs of the Euratom programme , as well as the gross domestic product by Euratom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution is related to the involvement of the EA@@ EC in the Common Company as soon as this is built . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the Swiss company J@@ ET over@@ sees a sum which is to be defined in accordance with the provisions of the Stat@@ utes of this Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , the Euratom to finance the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement about personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate the Euratom contributions to the financing of the works which are intended due to the corresponding contracts . &quot;
&quot; the Commission is dealt with the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , with which amount to the de@@ duction of expenses within the scope of the Euratom programme was envisaged for the current year . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Council , the Commission is paying the amount as follows : 7 / 12 before the 15 . January and 5 / 12 before the 15 . &quot;
July . the remaining payment mod@@ alities for financial contributions of Switzerland and EA@@ EC in accordance with this article are specified in Annex III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland will take all necessary measures , so that Euratom was banned by customs duties or other donations , as well as un@@ restricted and constra@@ ined part of the objects which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;

in the form of a stamp of stamp between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on the Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ meat
&quot; I honour me , referring to the recent negotiations between our delegations to define rules on the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community linked to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are dealt with : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed du@@ mb@@ bell - , lamb and goat meat ( 2 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; within this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in batt@@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement , Argentina is committed to ensuring the appropriate procedures that the fact carried out the annual amount not exceeds the agreed quantity , and in accordance with conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement will consult each other prior to the introduction of such a change in which under number 10 mentioned ten@@ ders to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community assumes the protective cl@@ ots , it is obliged to bear care that it is not touched in this agreement to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the entries from Argentina went out in one year the agreed quantities , the community reserves the right to withdraw from Argentina to the rest of the year . &quot;
&quot; the community is committed to con@@ fine the added value on in@@ flows from this agreement , to a ho@@ ech@@ less rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot;
&quot; in the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of these new Member States shall be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; on this occasion , the amount of the amount of surplus value is charged under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount of the total amount will be determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23 000 tons of slaugh@@ cell weight . &quot;
&quot; the community takes everything in order to avoid a market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the association takes preced@@ ent in order to prevent the sales volumes of frozen meat in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation the paragraph of Argent@@ inian h@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ inated meat . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this Agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of migrants or other conve@@ ying measures as well as for the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions , which are consistent with existing international obligations and the traditional part of the community at world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the compliance with this agreement is ensured in particular by the specified amounts of export licenses for the products mentioned under number 1 in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary precautions , so that the issu@@ ance of inser@@ tion licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products is determined by the presentation of a export license , determined by the given position of the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system will be determined that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of a licence @-@ license for the questionable products can be avoided .
&quot; in Imple@@ mentation regulations it is also specified , that the responsible authority of the community at the competent point of the Community has been issued periodic@@ ally for the export licenses ; these details are necessary to en@@ code to identification land . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears concern that the agreement is applied properly , and is working faul@@ t@@ lessly . &quot;
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat &apos;s car@@ nal market of both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the terms , which are important for that under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears concern that the proper application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat should not be executed under the arrangement of the tariff numbers under the agreement . &quot;
the committee discusses all questions suitable for the implementation of these agreements and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be considered un@@ har@@ med by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
which is number 2 fixed annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
